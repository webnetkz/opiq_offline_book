That is a scary number!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Good thing you found this article because </span><b><i>we aren’t going to let YOU be “most” people! </i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lower temps do not have to equal larger waistlines! You just have to have a plan! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this short read we will &#8230;</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Explain why winter weight gain happens. Knowing why is important if you want to prevent it and the reason is probably not what you think. In fact, it is partially not even your fault!</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tell you why fall/winter is actually the BEST time to start a diet and training plan.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Give you 7 easy pro tips that will help guide you through the next few months. </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You may believe winter weight gain happens because of the holidays. Those extra home cooked meals and holiday parties are certainly a factor. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But </span><b><i>there is a DAILY issue you need to be prepared to fight </i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">if you want to avoid packing on winter pounds.</span></p>
<p><b>WHY YOU REALLY PACK ON POUNDS AFTER LABOR DAY</b></p>
<p><img class="size-large wp-image-7471" src="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_130930953.jpeg?resize=1024%2C512&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="512" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_130930953.jpeg?resize=1024%2C512&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_130930953.jpeg?resize=300%2C150&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_130930953.jpeg?resize=768%2C384&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_130930953.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_130930953.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the spring and summer months, you are given what we call a</span><b> fitness freebie. </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You get a </span><b><i>seasonal motivation boost</i></b> <span style="font-weight: 400;">that doesn’t happen when temperatures start to drop, and you begin to pull out the chunky sweaters and comfy leggings. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not only is the sun shining (which makes you happier because of Vitamin D), you are wearing LESS clothing in the summer months. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I don’t know about you, but knowing I’m going to be exposing more skin makes walking in the gym a little easier. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Covering up in layers, no doubt leads to the temptation to slack on body goals! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Knowing your arms, legs, and abs will be less exposed can easily be an excuse to slack. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, being layered up often means you don’t SEE the extra pounds, so they are easier to ignore.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But there is more to it than being bundled up….</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-7477" src="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_236518834.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_236518834.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_236518834.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_236518834.jpeg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_236518834.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_236518834.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span>The #1 reason you slack on health and fitness goals in colder months ISN’T EVEN YOUR FAULT!!</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, you have a part to play in all of this, but</span><b><i> there is actually a scientific reason why you have less desire to train and eat healthy when the sunshine of summer fades.</i></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We will explain why a little further down. But ya know what really stinks? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The scientific reason why we all experience these motivation slumps in the winter only adds to an even bigger issue with motivation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span>It doesn’t matter what season it is motivation ALWAYS comes and goes!</p>
<p>Spring, Summer, Fall, or Winter &#8211; you can NEVER rely on it!</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, what can you do when lack of sunshine and warm temps leave you even more tempted to hit snooze and reach for comfort foods? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You certainly don’t throw your hands up in the air and wait until January to make a resolution to crash diet to get your body ready for spring. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Believe it or not, RIGHT NOW is actually the IDEAL time to get started! </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you </span><b><i>START NOW, </i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">you will develop discipline and a routine heading into the holidays. This will put you in a great place mentally and physically to relax and “indulge” a little more at all those holiday gatherings! </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><b><i>Look at it this way ..<br />
</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Would you rather head into the holiday season already making progress toward your goals and be in a great spot <em>(where it would be okay even if you did gain an extra pound or two?)</em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Or would you rather put it off and only add more fat on top of what you want to lose?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The answer is clear— the solution to getting the motivation needed to make it happen, not so much.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But don’t worry! We’ve got ya covered</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (no pun intended)</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with a few easy motivation hacks!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><b>7 TIPS TO STAY MOTIVATED AS SEASONS CHANGE</b></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><b><br />
</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the number one questions we always get is … “<em>I am just not motivated. How can I motivate myself to train and eat better?”</em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As we mentioned earlier, it doesn&#8217;t matter what season it is, </span><b><i>you can’t always rely on motivation. </i></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you have it, great! You should certainly take advantage of it! But you have to know that it is totally normal to not have much of it. Even professional athletes lack motivation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You have to develop other daily habits that create discipline if you want to succeed long term!</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are a few of our pro tips that we use with our clients, specifically when temperatures drop, and motivation seems to be at its lowest! </span></p>
<p><b>TIP #1: Switch To An At Home Training Program</b></p>
<p><img class="size-large wp-image-7448" src="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_185038762.jpeg?resize=1024%2C647&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="647" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_185038762.jpeg?resize=1024%2C647&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_185038762.jpeg?resize=300%2C189&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_185038762.jpeg?resize=768%2C485&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_185038762.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_185038762.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you know that getting out of bed and stepping into the winter elements is going to be an excuse trigger, make a plan to train at home during cooler months! Some of the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">most effective and challenging workouts </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">only require your body weight and </span><b><i>maybe</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a set of dumbbells or some resistance bands.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A good fat-blasting, muscle-building sweat session can 100% be achieved from the comfort of your home!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adjustable dumbbells, ankle weights, resistance bands, a jump rope, etc., are all things that are inexpensive and can easily be stored in a closet or under your bed and pulled out anytime you don’t feel like leaving the house.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But if you have </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">the right training program</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><b><i>you don’t need any of that. </i></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our favorite </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">at-home bodyweight-only program</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is called</span><b> MOVE. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was designed to help you achieve your fitness goals without a single piece of equipment, and each workout is under 20 minutes! </span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Learn more about MOVE by watching the video below!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you need </span><b>a little extra “nudge”</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to get up and get moving, another </span><b>pro-tip we use</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is keeping some </span><a href="https://sculptnation.com/products/pre-workout" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><b>PRE WORKOUT </b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">on your bedside table. Have it already blended up and chug it as soon as your alarm goes off!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By the time you have brushed your teeth and put on your workout clothes, you will have a nice little jolt of energy and</span><b><i> tons of motivation</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to get going before you have a chance to come up with an excuse! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the bottom of this article, we will tell you about a big end of summer sale happening so that you can stock up on our </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">favorite </span><a href="https://sculptnation.com/products/pre-workout" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><b>PRE WORKOUT</b></a><strong> for 40% off when you use code: LABORDAY40 at checkout! </strong></p>
<p><b>TIP #2: Make Your Workouts Seasonal</b></p>
<p><img class="size-large wp-image-7452" src="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_65703942.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_65703942.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_65703942.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_65703942.jpeg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_65703942.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_65703942.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Embrace the change of seasons and take advantage of activities that you can only do in fall or winter! </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Go on a fall hike and view all the gorgeous foliage.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Try rock climbing.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Walk around a corn maze or pumpkin patch with your family. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you live in a snowy climate, go skiing, sledding, build snowmen with your kids, etc.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Go ice skating.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lace-up your sneakers, go for a walk or run at night, and admire all the Christmas lights and decorations.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are some things you can only do and see during specific times of the year. So instead of missing sunshine and water sports, focus on all the positive things that only come about with cooler temps!</span></p>
<p><b>TIP #3: Try Something Totally New</b></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-7454" src="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_361152601.jpeg?resize=1024%2C514&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="514" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_361152601.jpeg?resize=1024%2C514&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_361152601.jpeg?resize=300%2C151&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_361152601.jpeg?resize=768%2C386&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_361152601.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_361152601.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sometimes a change of routine is all you need to boost motivation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you have been doing all your gym lifts alone, recruit a gym buddy! Try switching up your cardio by skipping your solo runs and joining a group fitness class instead. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another option is to </span><b><i>allow yourself to slow down!</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> If you have been crushing it all spring and summer with intense training and hardcore workouts, </span><b><i>it may actually be time to take it down a notch. </i></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Going full force 365 can cause your stress hormone cortisol to increase. This can lead to a host of drawbacks, including weight gain, muscle loss, poor moods, fatigue, and occasional issues sleeping! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We aren’t saying you should become lazy! But if you have been crushing it 24/7 all spring and summer, your body (and mind) may need to slow down.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Use the next few months to embrace a slower routine. </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Commit to daily yoga.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Focus on becoming more flexible.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Switch to low or moderate-intensity cardio, instead of HIIT.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Try out some bodyweight workouts instead of heavy lifting.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Giving your body a couple of months to recover might even make you more responsive when you decide to kick things up again come spring/summer!</span></p>
<p><b>TIP #4: Stay Accountable</b></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-7457" src="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_266584820.jpeg?resize=1024%2C768&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="768" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_266584820.jpeg?resize=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_266584820.jpeg?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_266584820.jpeg?resize=768%2C576&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_266584820.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_266584820.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><b><br />
</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">The best way to stick to a plan is to have someone that you report back to. This could be a friend, family member, a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">social media community</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, or even a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">coach. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Including someone else, or even just telling someone else about your health and fitness goals and asking them to check in with you to make sure you are sticking to the plan, is a great way to keep the promises you make to yourself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you prefer to fly solo, it helps to create visuals. Make a vision board, create a daily checklist you can mark off after each workout, or keep an accomplishment journal.</span></p>
<p><b>TIP #5: Set A Spring Goal</b></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-7458" src="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_47332240.jpeg?resize=1024%2C680&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="680" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_47332240.jpeg?resize=1024%2C680&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_47332240.jpeg?resize=300%2C199&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_47332240.jpeg?resize=768%2C510&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_47332240.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_47332240.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">March may seem like a long time away, but it will be back before you know it, and 6 months is a long time to make significant changes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Setting a goal is a great way to encourage yourself to push past discomforts and temptation, but there is a science to goal setting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The key to creating goals that stick .. </span><b><i>be REALISTIC and SPECIFIC!</i></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s start with </span><b><i>reality. </i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">You should always focus on one goal at a time and make sure you are being honest with yourself if that goal is really attainable.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you know that your schedule will never allow you to work out 6 days a week, why would you choose a program that requires you to do that?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you know it’s not healthy to attempt to lose 10 pounds a week, why would you aim that high?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you love carbs, why would you go on a KETO diet? </span></p>
<p><b><i>Doing these things will essentially set yourself up for failure.</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Set attainable goals that fit YOUR lifestyle. You can always bump things up if your schedule allows, or you notice you aren’t pushing yourself hard enough. Just keep in mind that being realistic isn’t the same as not believing in yourself or making excuses. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moving on to being </span><b><i>specific.</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The more specific you are about your goals, the more likely you will be to reach them. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It may seem like it’s good enough to say things like .. I want to look good, lose weight, or get ripped! </span><b><i>But you have to dig deeper than that!! </i></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wanting to “lose weight,” for example, is an excellent place to start. But ask yourself what that means to you?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you expand on that and say &#8212; “I want to lose 10 pounds of fat. I will do this by not eating any sweets and doing the V Shred </span><a href="https://vshred.com/sp/move/soc-all/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><b>MOVE </b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">program for 30 consecutive days. I am doing this because I want to have better self-esteem and a head start on bikini season.” &#8212; that makes your goal more specific.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The more specific (and attainable) your goals are, the more likely you will be to not give up!</span></p>
<p><b>TIP #6: Reward Yourself</b></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-7459" src="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/vin_sant_32048508_366936073798151_433609263865135104_n.jpg?resize=882%2C1024&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="882" height="1024" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/vin_sant_32048508_366936073798151_433609263865135104_n.jpg?resize=882%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 882w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/vin_sant_32048508_366936073798151_433609263865135104_n.jpg?resize=258%2C300&amp;ssl=1 258w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/vin_sant_32048508_366936073798151_433609263865135104_n.jpg?resize=768%2C892&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/vin_sant_32048508_366936073798151_433609263865135104_n.jpg?w=1080&amp;ssl=1 1080w" sizes="(max-width: 882px) 100vw, 882px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you have checked a “mini goal” off your list, treat yourself. Knowing that you have a reward coming to celebrate your efforts will make you want to achieve it even more. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It may be tempting to make your reward one of your favorite “forbidden foods” but we never suggest that you reward yourself this way.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You aren’t a dog. You should never reward “good behavior” with food. Having this mentality can create a really unhealthy relationship with food.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You need to eat healthy MOST of the time, control your portions, and see food as fuel. But if you are craving something that isn’t quite as healthy as your grilled chicken and rice, never feel like you need to lose 20 pounds to “deserve” a bite of cake, or nice dinner out with your family. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instead of rewarding yourself with food, buy yourself something you have been wanting. Maybe some new workout clothes, a massage, or an extra $20 bucks in your vacation fund! </span></p>

<p><b>TIP #7: Make Mental Health Top Priority</b></p>
<p><img class="size-large wp-image-7460" src="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_255894146.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_255894146.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_255894146.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_255894146.jpeg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_255894146.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_255894146.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Earlier, we mentioned that cold weather motivation dips may not be your fault.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’m sure you have heard of winter blues. Well, it’s a real thing. Less natural light can cause dips in serotonin, the neurotransmitter that regulates mood.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The dark and dreary days of winter can also cause your body to produce more of the sleep hormone melatonin. This shift can disrupt your body and impact your sleep patterns and overall mood.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are a few ways that you can focus on improving your mental health.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Invest in a light therapy box that simulates natural daylight.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Make sure you are supplementing with or eating plenty of foods with Vitamin D.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Start journaling. There is a lot of scientific evidence that supports putting your thoughts on paper provides a long list of benefits, including stress management, self-confidence, and goal setting. </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Suppose you still find yourself struggling with negative seasonal motivation shifts. In that case, you may need to experiment with taking</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> naturally sourced herbs</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to help support brain health and a positive mood.</span></p>
<p><b><i>Here are a few with some great scientific backing to help boost mood.</i></b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>EnXtra: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">A natural caffeine-free patent-pending botanical ingredient that has been shown to help increase dopamine levels.**It is also one of the first and only natural caffeine-free patent-pending botanical ingredients shown to boost mental alertness &amp; acuity for hours or ending in a huge caffeine energy crash.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Piper Nigrum Fruit Extract:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> A very specific type of black pepper that has been shown to help increase both serotonin and dopamine.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>L-Theanine:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> A powerful amino acid that is believed to help reduce occasional anxiety brought on by stressful situations.</span></li>
</ul>

<p><b><i>BOTTOM LINE IF YOU WANT TO STAY MOTIVATED YEAR ROUND</i></b><b><i><br />
</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you put away the shorts and swimsuits and shift out of bikini season, it’s common for motivation to “fall back” with the clocks. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The seasons have to change (unless you live near the equator) &#8211; so you have to figure out ways to</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">not let your fitness goals go into hibernation mode!</span><b><i> </i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pumpkin spice lattes are only here for a limited time, but getting into shape isn’t seasonal! </span><i>It&#8217;s a year-round commitment!!</i><i> </i></p>

<p>Family … Friends … Fireworks .. and a lot of FOOD!</p>
<p>That is how the majority of Americans plan to spend The 4th of July … and most of that food will be thrown on the grill .. as July Fourth is the most popular grilling day of the year.</p>
<p>If the idea of an Independence Day cookout has you feeling a little bit anxious about all the extra calories .. relax!!</p>
<p>It may seem like a diet disaster, but with a few adjustments, your cookout won’t set you back one bit!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Here are 5 Tips To Help You Grill Out GUILT FREE …</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>HEALTHY BBQ TIP #1: FIRE UP THE GRILL</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://sculptnation.com/products"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-7313" src="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_83769871.jpeg?resize=1170%2C834&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1170" height="834" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_83769871.jpeg?w=3052&amp;ssl=1 3052w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_83769871.jpeg?resize=300%2C214&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_83769871.jpeg?resize=768%2C547&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_83769871.jpeg?resize=1024%2C730&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_83769871.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w" sizes="(max-width: 1170px) 100vw, 1170px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>If your BBQ includes grilling .. you are in luck. This is one of the best ways to cook meat or make some veggies. You use much less (if any) oil on a grill, as opposed to sautéing or roasting. Grilling alone will really help lower your 4th of July calorie intake.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>HEALTHY BBQ TIP #2: PICK LEAN PROTEINS</strong></p>
<p><img class="size-large wp-image-7335" src="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_187212985.jpeg?resize=1024%2C661&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="661" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_187212985.jpeg?resize=1024%2C661&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_187212985.jpeg?resize=300%2C194&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_187212985.jpeg?resize=768%2C496&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_187212985.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_187212985.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>Hitting your protein goals on the 4th shouldn’t be a problem. You just need to be careful what cut of meat you choose.</p>
<p>A small burger patty or steak could easily set you back 25 grams of fat or more. Most hot dogs have a minimum of 14 grams of fat. Of course, that is before all the condiments and cheese.</p>
<p>You can still have a juicy, delicious burger, or hot dog, you just need to pick a leaner cut.</p>
<p>Examples of lean cuts of beef are … 96/4 or 90/10 ground sirloin, eye of round steak, sirloin tip steak, top round steak, bottom round steak, and top sirloin steak</p>
<p>For hot dogs .. there are a lot of low-fat or even fat-free franks on the market. You can also opt for a turkey or chicken hot dog. Just make sure you look at the nutrition label. People often think that turkey and chicken are automatically the most calorie-friendly choice. Sometimes they can be just as calorie filled as the original.</p>
<p>You can always skip the beef and go with other lean meats like chicken breast, white fish, shrimp, or even salmon.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>HEALTHY BBQ TIP #3: DITCH THE BUN &amp; CHOOSE CONDIMENTS WISELY</strong></p>
<p><img class="size-large wp-image-7330" src="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_266973608.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_266973608.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_266973608.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_266973608.jpeg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_266973608.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_266973608.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">What&#8217;s a burger or hot dog without a bun? Actually .. they can be just as delicious without all those extra carbs. A bun usually contains about 200 calories.</p>
<p>Why not save those calories for some delicious sides like potato salad? Or an adult beverage, like a watermelon tonic?</p>
<p>After all, the bun is really just a way for us to eat what’s inside. Your burger will be just as good eaten with a fork!</p>
<p>Save yourself some calories, and opt for a lettuce wrap or no bun at all. Or, check out this delicious bun recipe that is EASY to make and will only set you back a few carbs. You won&#8217;t miss the real bread, promise!!</p>
<p>To make your burger more filling, load it up with plenty of vegetables &#8211; like tomatoes, onions, mushrooms, lettuce, jalapenos, etc. But use caution with condiments.</p>
<p>BBQ sauce and mayonnaise can be calorie bombs. A couple tiny spoonfuls could set you back hundreds of calories. Believe it or not, even ketchup is pretty calorie-dense.</p>
<p>Mustard, salsa, horseradish, and hot sauce are great choices. There are some great low-sugar or lower calorie bbq and ketchup alternatives out there. Look for those when you do your 4th of July grocery haul!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>HEALTHY BBQ TIP #4: PORTION CONTROL</strong></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-7331" src="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_90994388.jpeg?resize=1024%2C669&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="669" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_90994388.jpeg?resize=1024%2C669&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_90994388.jpeg?resize=300%2C196&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_90994388.jpeg?resize=768%2C502&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_90994388.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_90994388.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>The best way to avoid a bbq binge is to not go to your cookout hungry. Starving yourself all day could backfire .. causing you to overeat on higher calorie foods.</p>
<p>You don’t need to starve yourself all day and stock-pile calories. Especially if you are using any of our healthy recipes below.</p>
<p>You also don’t need to eat everything available. Prioritize lean protein and veggies and then scan the picnic table for what appeals to you <em><strong>the most</strong></em> and only have small portions of each of those things.</p>
<p>Eat plenty of protein leading up to the BBQ and drink lots of water. Protein shakes are a convenient and delicious way to do that .. and for a limited time we are giving you <strong>40% off your <a href="https://sculptnation.com/products" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sculpt Nation</a> order!</strong></p>

<p>You can also avoid overeating by eating slow and socializing! Food may be a big part of 4th of July festivities .. but it’s not the only reason we gather to celebrate.</p>
<p>If you find yourself still wanting more, step away from the food spread for a little while. Drink some water, or enjoy one of our low-calorie drinks below. Give yourself a little bit of time before you go back for seconds.</p>
<p>Another way you can keep your cravings in check and make sure your body is in a better fat burning mode (instead of fat storing mode) .. is to take a fat-burning thermogenic support supplement like <a href="https://sculptnation.com/products/burn" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>Sculpt Nation BURN.</strong></em></a></p>
<p>This product has a ton of science-backed ingredients that can help naturally suppress your appetite!</p>

<p>It helps support and raise your metabolic rate, which helps boost your body’s ability to burn fat for fuel!</p>

<p>When you think about your genetics …. what comes to mind?</p>
<p>Probably traits passed down from your parents .. like your eye and hair color, the shape of your nose, maybe even your hot temper, and of course, the shape of your body.</p>
<p>You have probably heard someone say something similar to this (and possibly even said it yourself) &#8230;<em><strong>“Everyone in my family is overweight. It doesn’t matter what I do, it’s my genetics.”</strong></em></p>
<p>Yes, genetics can determine where you store fat, how much muscle you can pack on, how wide your hips are, and even how your body responds to certain foods. We even preach the importance of <a href="https://vshred.com/sp/survey/survey-aka1/">training and eating for your specific body type</a> because <em><strong>our FIXED genes can influence many aspects of who we are</strong></em>.</p>
<p>We can’t control the genes we’ve been given. But when it comes to how well you can drop body fat… <em><strong>the finger may need to be pointed at a second set of genes you didn’t get from your parents.</strong></em></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-6899 size-full" src="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/AdobeStock_216416516.jpeg?resize=1170%2C741&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1170" height="741" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/AdobeStock_216416516.jpeg?w=5760&amp;ssl=1 5760w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/AdobeStock_216416516.jpeg?resize=300%2C190&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/AdobeStock_216416516.jpeg?resize=768%2C486&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/AdobeStock_216416516.jpeg?resize=1024%2C649&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/AdobeStock_216416516.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/AdobeStock_216416516.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1170px) 100vw, 1170px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><strong>The Second Genome</strong><br />
There are over 37 trillion “human” cells in our bodies that contain our DNA, and <em><strong>the majority of these cells ARE NOT hereditary genes.</strong></em></p>
<p>It’s a “second set of genes” that researchers call our second genome. Unlike your inherited genes, which are more or less fixed, this second set of genes is not.</p>
<p>57% of the cells that make YOU who YOU ARE and live in your body are not passed down by your parents.</p>
<p><em><strong>THIS IS GOOD NEWS</strong></em> … we will tell you why and how you can reverse this a little further down in this article.</p>
<p>First, let’s explain what this “second genome” is.</p>
<p>This second set of genes is a bunch of bacteria, fungi, parasites, and viruses! That’s right, you are mostly made up of a bunch of .. well .. bugs.</p>
<p>These microscopic organisms (<strong>called MICROBIOME</strong>) play a vital role in supporting the daily operation of your body.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-6900 size-full" src="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/AdobeStock_152941653.jpeg?resize=1170%2C941&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1170" height="941" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/AdobeStock_152941653.jpeg?w=7000&amp;ssl=1 7000w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/AdobeStock_152941653.jpeg?resize=300%2C241&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/AdobeStock_152941653.jpeg?resize=768%2C618&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/AdobeStock_152941653.jpeg?resize=1024%2C824&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/AdobeStock_152941653.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/AdobeStock_152941653.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1170px) 100vw, 1170px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>You name it&#8230; your microbiome helps it function.</p>
<ul>
<li>Food Digestion</li>
<li>Nutrient Absorption</li>
<li>Energy Production</li>
<li>Immune System Regulation (⅔ of our immune system resides in the gut)</li>
<li>Skin Health</li>
<li>Mental Health/Brain Function</li>
<li>++ MORE</li>
</ul>
<p>These microbes live everywhere in your body! Bacteria is the most common organism, and the vast majority takes residency in your gut.</p>
<p>A healthy adult will have about FIVE POUNDS of bacteria in their colon. Some are BENEFICIAL… others are HARMFUL!</p>
<p>If you have too much unfriendly bacteria, that is when you may start to have<br />
adverse effects such as&#8230;</p>
<ul>
<li>GI Discomfort (occasional bloating, constipation, diarrhea, indigestion)</li>
<li>Fatigue</li>
<li>Brian Fog</li>
<li>Difficulty Losing Weight</li>
<li>A Sluggish Immune System</li>
<li>Nutrition Deficiency</li>
<li>Unrestful Sleep</li>
<li>++ MORE</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>Here is THE GOOD NEWS &#8230;</strong></em></p>
<p>The organisms live in you today may not be the same as the ones that colonize next week. They are constantly changing and have been since the day you were born.</p>
<p>This means you have the ability to impact what could be holding you back from reaching your fitness goals AND feeling your best mentally and physically.</p>
<p>But this can only happen if you take <em><strong>a very specific and proactive approach</strong></em> to ensure you are swapping out that “bad” bacteria with good bacteria .. or at least maintaining a proper balance of the two.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>You need to reach something called “Microbial Harmony.”</strong></em></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-6901 size-full" src="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/AdobeStock_292486431.jpeg?resize=1170%2C781&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1170" height="781" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/AdobeStock_292486431.jpeg?w=6004&amp;ssl=1 6004w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/AdobeStock_292486431.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/AdobeStock_292486431.jpeg?resize=768%2C513&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/AdobeStock_292486431.jpeg?resize=1024%2C684&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/AdobeStock_292486431.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/AdobeStock_292486431.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1170px) 100vw, 1170px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><strong>What Is Microbial Harmony?</strong><br />
We all have our own “Microbiome Blueprint” that is as unique as your fingerprint … nobody else has YOUR exact microbiome. Even identical twins are made up of a totally different accumulation of microbial life.</p>
<p>Researchers have also found that the organisms that live in people of a healthy weight are VERY DIFFERENT than those that are overweight. This strongly suggests&#8230; <em><strong>having a healthy balance of bacteria likely play a crucial role in our ability to lose weight.</strong></em></p>
<p>The reason our microbiome is so individual (and continually changing) is most likely a result of our personal lifestyle practices as well as our interactions with the world around us.</p>
<ul>
<li>Eating too many processed foods</li>
<li>Lack of micro-nutrient diversity</li>
<li>Not exercising</li>
<li>Environmental toxins (in the air you breathe, the water you drink and bathe in, foods you consume, surfaces you touch, pollution, etc.)</li>
<li>Stress</li>
<li>Age</li>
</ul>
<p>As you see… some of these things you do have total control over… others, not so much!</p>
<p>If you are serious about wanting to get in the best shape of your life and feel even better than you look… <em><strong>you need to take GUT HEALTH seriously.</strong></em></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Action Step #1</strong></span><br />
STOP being so quick to “blame” your genetics for every setback and issue with your health and take responsibility for what you are (or aren’t) doing to contribute.<br />
Unlike the genes your ancestors gave you, many of your issues could be tied to your second genome, and reversing that is somewhat in your control!</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Action Step #2</strong></span><br />
Remove (or add) the things you have control over. Things such as .. lowering your stress levels, getting enough sleep, eliminating or reducing processed foods, and exercising regularly.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Action Step #3</strong></span><br />
This step is the most important and something you have COMPLETE control over.<br />
You have to replenish your healthy bacteria. To do this, you have to feed your gut healthy bacteria.</p>
<p>There are two ways you can go about this&#8230;.</p>
<p>You could attempt to incorporate very specific high quality prebiotic and probiotic foods that are rich in healthy bacteria.</p>
<p>This would include consistently consuming LARGE amounts of things like…</p>
<ul>
<li>Yogurt</li>
<li>Kefir</li>
<li>Kimchi or Sauerkraut</li>
<li>Raw/Organic Fruits &amp; Vegetables</li>
<li>Specific Nuts and Beans</li>
<li>Seeds (such as chia and flax)</li>
<li>++ MORE</li>
</ul>
<p>Most people would never be able to eat this type of variety every single day.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>Or&#8230; you could go the much easier and better route!</strong></em></p>
<p>Our product formulation team at Sculpt Nation studied HUNDREDS of gut-beneficial strains of bacteria and narrowed it down to 7 KEY STRAINS that you need daily to achieve Microbial Harmony.</p>
<p>These strains deliver over 3.8 BILLION colony-forming units of microbiome-boosting bacteria that will get your gut in a balanced “harmonized” state.</p>
<p>Our researchers also discovered that this bacteria has to have a very type of specific FOOD to survive and thrive!</p>
<p>It took our team over 18 months to get this formula right, and we are FINALLY ready and eager to pass it on to you!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="https://sculptnation.com/probiotics-mini-vsl-v9"><em><strong>Discover how to achieve Microbial Harmony&#8230; in SECONDS!</strong></em></a></p>
<p><a href="https://sculptnation.com/probiotics-mini-vsl-v9"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-7409" src="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/ezgif-2-caba50571434.gif?resize=600%2C554&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="600" height="554" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><em><strong>THE TRUTH IS…..</strong></em><br />
Most of us are in a state of “Microbial Chaos” that puts your body in a position that makes it IMPOSSIBLE to look, feel, and function at your best.</p>
<p><em><strong>YOU ARE NOT STUCK!</strong> </em><br />
What makes YOU (you) .. is more than the DNA passed down from your bloodline! We simply overlook the fact that our microbiome has a KEY role in so many of our body (and brain) functions.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>Experts say that we have more bacteria in our guts than we do cells in our entire body!</strong></em><br />
<em><strong>So many … that they estimate we are only 10% human &#8230; and 90% bacteria!</strong></em></p>
<p>If that doesn’t tell you just how vital GUT HEALTH is … we aren’t sure what will!</p>
<p><em><strong>DO NOT DELAY!</strong></em> We really can’t overstate the importance of gut health and achieving the Microbial Harmony needed to achieve that.</p>
<p>An angry gut is no small thing!<br />
Start taking charge of your health and properly achieve Microbial Harmony today!!</p>

<p>‘Tis the season … that many people freak out about all the calories they are about to consume.</p>
<p>Understandably so! Temptations are everywhere this time of year!</p>
<ul>
<li>Your workplace probably has a new cookie delivery every day in December.</li>
<li>Your calendar is likely full of parties where high-calorie adult beverages and appetizers will be freely passed around.</li>
<li>You have at least one family feast to attend, if not several, all in one or two days.</li>
<li>You may be traveling with limited access to everything you (think) you need to stay on track with training.</li>
</ul>
<p>BUT .. you have a choice in how you approach the holidays.</p>
<p>You can CHOOSE to relax and enjoy yourself.<br />
<strong>OR</strong><br />
You can CHOOSE to be scared, stressed, and anxiety-filled.</p>
<p>All the things that make “dieting” hard, to begin with, will only be multiplied this month.<br />
But with a little planning and the right attitude, the holiday season is NOTHING to worry about.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong>8 Easy Tips For a Guilt-Free Holiday</strong></h3>
<p><strong>DO NOT STARVE YOURSELF&#8230;</strong><br />
If you go to a party or sit down at the holiday dinner table extremely hungry, you will no doubt overeat. Be mindful of what you eat leading into your holiday feast, but don’t go in starving. Unless you already incorporate dieting techniques such as Intermittent Fasting, if you are hungry before your feast, we do not suggest you skip meals.</p>
<p>Fill up on lean proteins and veggies, or enjoy a delicious <a href="https://sculptnation.com/product/protein/">Sculpt Nation protein shake using our top of the line Whey Protein Isolate!</a></p>

<p><strong>CHOOSE WISELY…</strong><br />
Just because it’s available does not mean you have to eat it. You should prioritize your favorite foods and only eat what you enjoy.</p>
<p>If you don’t love cranberry sauce, why eat it?<br />
If you have been craving your grandma’s stuffing all year, eat more of that!<br />
If you aren’t a big drinker, pass on the egg nog and have yourself a bigger slice of pie!<br />
Pile up on protein, but maybe go light on the gravy.</p>
<p>Also, remember that your eyes tend to be bigger than your stomach. Sometimes simply seeing or smelling all that delicious food will increase your appetite. <a href="https://sculptnation.com/product/burn-fat-burner/">Sculpt Nation BURN</a> would be a great product to implement. BURN is a cutting edge fat burner that contains a powerful appetite suppressant that can help hold back the desire to overfill your plate.</p>
<p><a href="https://sculptnation.com/product/burn-fat-burner/"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-6612 size-large" src="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/BURN-GIF-FINAL.gif?resize=576%2C1024&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="576" height="1024" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/BURN-GIF-FINAL.gif?resize=576%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 576w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/BURN-GIF-FINAL.gif?resize=169%2C300&amp;ssl=1 169w" sizes="(max-width: 576px) 100vw, 576px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><strong>BE MINDFUL…</strong><br />
When it’s time to dig in, start with smaller portions, and then eat slowly. If you think you want to go back for seconds <em>(or thirds)</em>, give yourself a break before filling your plate again.</p>
<p>Your hands are a great measuring tool if you want to ensure you don’t go overboard.</p>
<p><strong>Your clenched fist is about a cup…</strong> This measure is useful for side dishes.</p>
<p><strong>The palm of your hand is about 3 ounces of cooked meat…</strong> Use this as a guide for all that turkey and ham.</p>
<p><strong>Your thumb = about 1 tablespoon….</strong> This measure comes in handy when you’re trying to estimate things like dressings and gravy.</p>
<p><strong>MODIFY…</strong><br />
We are NOT suggesting that you ask your wife, mom, or grandma to change their family recipe. But there is nothing wrong with modifying the dish that you contribute.<br />
There are endless ways to make all your holiday favorites into lower-calorie options, especially for breakfast! Why not serve up some <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/pumpkin-spice-protein/">Sculpt Nation Protein Pancakes</a> instead of a high-calorie Christmas morning feast. With a little creativity, modifications are endless!</p>
<p><strong>JUST MOVE…</strong><br />
You may not be able to get in your usual lifts and cardio, but that doesn’t mean you can’t get in a good workout. At the very least, you can always go for a brisk walk or jog.</p>
<p>If time allows, our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCOFCwvhDoUvYcfpD7RJKQwA">YouTube Channel</a> has endless home workouts that take no equipment and only minutes of your day!</p>
<p>One thing we DO NOT want you to do is use verbiage like “earning” your dinner. Food is not some sort of reward and exercise should not be seen as punishment. Treat your holiday workout just like you would any other day of the year. Do it because you are ABLE and because it’s part of your lifestyle.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAK UP&#8230;</strong><br />
Do not be shy when it comes to telling people about your healthy lifestyle. Tell everyone about why it is important to you! It will hopefully keep them from guilting you into overeating or making comments about your choices. You never know, you may even motivate them to do the same. To help them get started and point them in the right direction. you can always encourage them to take our <a href="https://vshred.com/sp/survey/survey-aka1/">FREE body type quiz!</a></p>
<p><strong>STAY OFF THE SCALE…</strong><br />
While one meal, or even a few, will not wreck your progress, it most likely will have temporary effects on your weight. If you eat lots of food, all of that volume will be sitting in your stomach until it fully digests. The weight gain you see is not FAT GAIN. Most of what you see on the scale will be fluid retention. Not to mention other factors that can cause the scale to go up. Things like stress, lack of sleep, and even travel.</p>
<p>Holidays aside, remember that even on a typical day, weight can fluctuate several pounds. The holidays are no different. Take a scale break. Before you weigh yourself post-holiday, give your body at least 3-5 days to normalize.</p>
<p><strong>ENJOY EVERY BITE&#8230;</strong><br />
Worrying about weight gain is way more unhealthy than any temporary pounds you may (but most likely will not) pack on.</p>
<p>We aren’t saying that it is okay to “overindulge” just because it’s a holiday.<br />
We are saying that a few days of enjoying yourself WILL NOT derail your progress.</p>
<p>Stressing out over the holidays isn’t going to do anything except make you less likely to enjoy your time with friends and family. In fact, all that anxiety can backfire and be the reason you overeat. Having a preoccupation with food often causes people to go to ‘extremes’ and do things like binge-eat. Stress also raises your cortisol levels, which can lead to scale fluctuations and even excess fat storage.</p>
<p>If you have a problem controlling your anxiety, you may want to grab some <a href="https://sculptnation.com/product/neuroctane/">Sculpt Nation NEUROCTANE</a>. This product features adaptogens that naturally reduce stress and raise dopamine and serotonin levels. You will naturally feel more relaxed in those stress and anxiety-filled situations.</p>
<p>We know the holidays are an expensive time of year, so we teamed up with Sculpt Nation to bring you a <strong>major discount </strong>on the supplements that melt fat, build lean muscle, and revitalize your health.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Don’t let the holiday cash-crunch bring you down. Get all Sculpt Nation supplements (including the ones I mentioned earlier ) <a href="https://sculptnation.com/shop/">40% off when you use code: MERRY40 at checkout! Click Here</a>.</p>

<p><strong>REMEMBER&#8230;</strong> the holidays are about more than food. Shift your focus to making memories that don’t involve eating. Do not be so focused on food and weight gain that you miss out on what is important this Holiday season. You can’t redo life once it’s passed you by!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>From our V SHRED family to yours, we wish you a HAPPY (and stress-free) HOLIDAY.</strong></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3 style="text-align: left;"><em>(You Really Don’t Need To Make Salads All The Time When Farm-Fresh Greens + Collagen Are Available In Just One Scoop A Day!)</em></h3>
<p>What if you could get all the nutrition you need for the day in about one minute flat&#8230;<em>how would that feel?</em> How much time could you save on your morning routine? Maybe you’d sleep a few minutes later, save money on grocery shopping, or feel confident you’re doing everything you need to do to stay healthy? Or maybe you’d workout a little less and and not feel guilty about it because you can still get the same results with less effort??</p>
<p>Maybe you’d have way more energy and stamina when you workout&#8230;and maybe you’d be able to save a little money because you can finally stop buying so many other supplements…</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>The right powdered greens could change your whole life!</em></p>
<div id="including" class="anchor"><img class="alignnone wp-image-6268 size-large" src="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/greens-salad.png?resize=1024%2C827&#038;ssl=1" alt="How To Get A Full Day’s Nutrition In One Minute FLAT" width="1024" height="827" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/greens-salad.png?resize=1024%2C827&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/greens-salad.png?resize=300%2C242&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/greens-salad.png?resize=768%2C620&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/greens-salad.png?w=1112&amp;ssl=1 1112w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Whatever you’d do instead if you didn’t always have to eat salads or cook vegetables&#8230;I’m here to let you know <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>y</strong><strong>ou can stop wishing that lifestyle was real.</strong></span> And it’s not gonna mess up your budget or cost you your entire paycheck, either&#8230;</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Because I Found The Perfect Greens Powder </strong><strong>That You Can Mix With Water </strong><em><strong>(..tastes amazing, too!)</strong></em></h3>
<p>See&#8230;the truth is lots of greens powders aren’t made in FDA-registered facilities. What this means is lots of greens powders don’t have government oversight…which increases the chance that you might have unhealthy ingredients like bacteria or heavy metals in them. You can easily avoid this by just using supplements like the one I am about to recommend…</p>
<p>Supplements that are manufactured in FDA-registered facilities so you won’t risk making yourself sick.<br />
People all over the country feel like this about this company. And there’s no reason why you can’t feel the same way!</p>
<h3>FACT: Your Average Green Powder Tastes Like Grass</h3>
<p>As you probably already know, greens powder is made from dried greens. There’s nothing too complicated about it. But the problem is because it’s so simple to make a green powder, lots of companies skimp out on small details that make the difference between a good powder and a GREAT one.</p>
<p><strong>It happens all the time.</strong></p>
<p>That’s why I spent so much time looking for the perfect green powder. Like you, I can go eat a salad anytime I want. But I wanted something more. I wanted a green powder that…</p>
<ul>
<li>Helped me to burn fat faster</li>
<li>Killed inflammation</li>
<li>Made my brain even healthier</li>
<li>Gave me more energy throughout the day</li>
<li>Improved my physical appearance and helped me with my skin</li>
<li>Detoxified my body</li>
<li>Boosted my immune system</li>
<li>And optimized my workouts!</li>
</ul>
<p>Because while greens are <em>definitely</em> necessary  for us to survive and thrive…we also need just a little more than that. We need a diverse blend of nutrition.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://sculptnation.com/product/greens/">Sculpt Nation Greens &#8211; The Ultimate Green Powder Mixture!</a></h3>
<p><img class="size-large wp-image-6279 alignnone" src="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/GREENS-FL-juice-01-FB.png?resize=1024%2C536&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="536" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/GREENS-FL-juice-01-FB.png?resize=1024%2C536&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/GREENS-FL-juice-01-FB.png?resize=300%2C157&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/GREENS-FL-juice-01-FB.png?resize=768%2C402&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/GREENS-FL-juice-01-FB.png?w=1200&amp;ssl=1 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>Everyone already knows you need fruits and vegetables to be your healthiest. But what you might not know is the best green powder needs to have protein in it, too. I did a lot of research and discovered that the healthiest kind of protein for us to consume is one that is already found in abundance in your body.</p>
<p>That protein is collagen</p>
<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em><strong>According to research, here’s what collagen does for you:</strong></em></span></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>It helps your skin:</strong> You’ll look younger, have fewer wrinkles, and you’ll recover from skin injuries better and faster.</li>
<li><strong>It makes your joints more flexible and less painful:</strong> This means workouts will feel better, you’ll be less likely to hurt your joints while walking, running, or exercising.</li>
<li><strong>It’ll keep your bones strong as you get older</strong>: This is important for both men and women since we both lose bone density and strength with age.</li>
<li><strong>Your muscle gains will come easier:</strong> Your muscles LOVE collagen. It helps grow muscle strength and size after exercise.</li>
<li><strong>Your heart will be healthier:</strong> Collagen keeps your heart, arteries, and blood vessels strong. A healthy heart also means more effective exercise.</li>
<li><strong>Your hair will be healthier and fuller:</strong> Which could possibly keep you from going bald or having lots of hair shedding as you get older.</li>
</ul>
<p>And this list goes on and on. I can go on and on about how healthy collagen is for us <strong>which is why I&#8217;m so excited to find a greens powder that has it.</strong> In addition to collagen, it has fruit, the antioxidant turmeric, ashwagandha in it!</p>
<p>When you put all these ingredients together, you get a powerful, blended-greens powder that does all the things I mentioned and tastes so good you’ll be tempted to drink it all day long&#8230;</p>
<p><em><strong>So I’d like to introduce you to&#8230;</strong></em></p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://sculptnation.com/product/greens/">Sculpt Nation Greens In Strawberry and Peach Flavor</a></h3>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>30-seconds, 1 scoop = a better body &amp; dramatically improved mental and physical health.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The first Superfood Blended Greens Powder designed specifically for people who eat clean and want to maximize muscle build, maintain their ideal weight (or burn fat fast), and save time in their healthy routine.</p>
<p>If you’ve been burned by “green” products in the past… if you were promised superfood shake and instead got bottom-of-the-barrel vitamins in a sludgy liquid that tasted like gasoline doused with fermented weeds…</p>
<p>Don’t worry…<strong>We OBSESS on taste.</strong></p>
<p>We’ve made all flavors of GREENS, including the brand new <strong>Strawberry</strong> and <strong>Peach</strong> flavors taste so sinfully delicious that you’d swear you’re breaking your diet with every sip.

<h2>Post-Workout Nutrition | Its Benefits to Overall Fitness and Health</h2>
<div id="how" class="anchor"></div>
<h3>How is Post-Workout Nutrition Beneficial to One&#8217;s Overall Fitness and Health?</h3>
<p>Post-workout nutrition is more important than many athletes realize. As important as <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/what-to-eat-before-workout/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pre-workout food</a> is, it is also crucial to turn your attention to what you eat after working out. Post-workout meal planning is essential to help you get the most benefit from your workout.</p>
<div id="why" class="anchor"></div>
<h3>Why is Eating the Right Post-Workout Food So Important?</h3>
<p><!-- instagram error: invalid instagram resource --></p>
<p>During your workout, your body begins the process of proteolysis, or the breaking down muscle proteins. That process intensifies during the three hours after your workout. The post-workout food choices that are best for you are ones that accomplish the following two things:</p>
<ol>
<li>Minimize the breakdown of muscles post-workout.</li>
<li>Stimulate protein synthesis to promote muscle growth.</li>
</ol>
<p>Protein eaten at any time is essential for promoting muscle growth. Protein consumed post-workout packs a little more power in that muscle-boosting punch.</p>
<p><strong>How much of a boost does it give?</strong></p>
<p>According to a study, post-workout infusions of amino acids yielded<span> </span><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9252488" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9252488">30 to 100 percent more protein synthesis</a><span> </span>than the same infusions administered while subjects were at rest.</p>
<p>That means that the right source of protein is essential post-workout food if you’re <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/how-to-gain-muscle-mass/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hoping to build muscle</a>, even if lean muscle production is your goal.</p>
<p><strong>What kinds of protein are best after working out?</strong></p>
<p>The beautiful thing about protein is that there are so many options for getting quality protein – even on the go. These are some of the foods to consider for your after workout meal:</p>
<ul>
<li>Greek yogurt</li>
<li>Eggs</li>
<li>Cottage cheese</li>
<li>Protein bars</li>
<li>Tuna</li>
<li>Salmon</li>
<li>Chicken</li>
</ul>
<p>You can even use animal or plant-based protein powders to make smoothies for a quick boost of nutrient-rich, protein-packed energy after working out.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://vshred.com/blog/high-protein-diet-plans/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">How much protein do you need</a> to consume after a workout?</strong></p>
<p>While the age old rule of thumb has been to consume a minimum of 20 grams of protein in after workout meals, modern wisdom shines new light on the subject.</p>
<p>This new information reveals that different people require different amounts of protein to optimize protein synthesis. Many experts now recommend between 40 and 50 grams of protein post-workout to achieve maximum protein synthesis.</p>
<div id="out" class="anchor"></div>
<h3>Carbohydrates After Working Out?</h3>
<p>With so much controversy over carbohydrates, it seems like this would be a taboo topic when it comes to effective post-workout foods. The truth is carbs help replenish depleted glycogen stores. Your body burns glycogen to fuel your workout. Carbs help to restore balance.</p>
<p>Not all workouts require as much help in restoring these depleted reserves. For instance, endurance sports and activities (running, swimming, cycling, etc.) need more compared to <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/strength-training/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">body building or resistance training</a>.</p>
<p>Note: It is more important for people who engage in exercise more frequently (such as twice in the same day without days of rest between workouts) than for people who workout more sporadically.</p>
<p>For those who require the replenishment of glycogen stores, however, the general rule of thumb is to follow a carb to protein ratio of 3:1. This indicates three grams of carbs for every one gram of protein. Consuming the right carbs and proteins together stimulates insulin secretion which promotes optimal glycogen synthesis.</p>
<p>Also, consume this carb to protein mixture within 30 minutes of training to achieve the proper synthesis of glycogen.</p>
<p>Among the best post-workout carbs to consider are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sweet potatoes</li>
<li>Chocolate milk</li>
<li>Fruits</li>
<li>Rice cakes</li>
<li>Oatmeal</li>
<li>Potatoes</li>
<li>Pasta</li>
<li>Leafy green vegetables (the darker varieties)</li>
<li>Rice</li>
</ul>
<p>These carbs are easily digestible and simple to prepare making them excellent choices for post-workout fuel.</p>
<div id="dont" class="anchor"></div>
<h3>Don’t Forget the Fats</h3>
<p><!-- instagram error: invalid instagram resource --></p>
<p>Fat is often maligned today. However, fat is an essential component of a healthy diet. The thing to remember is that there are good fats and bad fats. Healthy fats to include in a well-rounded post-workout meal plan include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Avocados</li>
<li>Nuts</li>
<li>Nut butters</li>
<li>Coconut oils</li>
<li>Fatty fish (like salmon)</li>
</ul>
<p>The key is moderation and discretion when consuming fats after working out and at any other time. Focusing on healthy fats allows you to enjoy the benefits without many of the risks associated with unhealthy varieties of fats.</p>
<div id="timing" class="anchor"></div>
<h3>Timing Your Post-Workout Meals</h3>
<p>Timing is everything when it comes to maximizing the impact of a good after workout meal. While some suggest eating within 30 minutes of working out, there are others who suggest you may have up to 45 minutes after you finish exercising to enjoy the benefits.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the sooner you begin restoring your body’s depleted stores, the better. That means that preparing meals ahead of time is your best bet or consider portable meals as part of your post-workout routine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Whether you’re looking to get fit or build serious muscle, the foods you eat after working out are just as important as those you eat before your workout for helping you accomplish your goals. This guide should help you identify the best foods to eat after a workout for the results you want.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Maintain a lean, healthy body by keeping track of your Thanksgiving calories this coming holiday season.</p>
<h2>Keeping Track of This Year’s Thanksgiving Calories</h2>
<h3>Food</h3>
<p><a href="https://vshred.com/blog/how-many-calories-should-i-eat-lose-weight/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Keeping track of the calories</a> you consume is important no matter what your fitness goal is. Here&#8217;s how much calories every Thanksgiving food item has.</p>
<h3>Turkey</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-5349 size-full" src="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Bs_4ce9_w0I-roasted-turkey-thanksgiving-calories-us.jpg?resize=625%2C400&#038;ssl=1" alt="Turkey | How To Size Out Your Thanksgiving Calories" width="625" height="400" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Bs_4ce9_w0I-roasted-turkey-thanksgiving-calories-us.jpg?w=625&amp;ssl=1 625w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Bs_4ce9_w0I-roasted-turkey-thanksgiving-calories-us.jpg?resize=300%2C192&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><strong>Serving size:</strong> 3 ounces (The size of a deck of cards)</p>
<p><strong>Calories:</strong> 132 (white meat)</p>
<p>How many calories are in a slice of Thanksgiving turkey? Well, the calories in turkey dinner with all the trimmings are around 132 per 3 ounces. Take note that this is for white meat turkey. Dark meat turkey is much tastier but has more fats and calories.</p>
<h3>Vegetables</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-5350 size-full" src="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/asian-food-bowl-close-up-cuisine-thanksgiving-calories-px.jpg?resize=625%2C400&#038;ssl=1" alt="Vegetables | How To Size Out Your Thanksgiving Calories" width="625" height="400" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/asian-food-bowl-close-up-cuisine-thanksgiving-calories-px.jpg?w=625&amp;ssl=1 625w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/asian-food-bowl-close-up-cuisine-thanksgiving-calories-px.jpg?resize=300%2C192&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><strong>Serving size:</strong> ½ cup (a rounded handful of chosen veggies)</p>
<p><strong>Calories:</strong> Varies</p>
<p>A half cup of vegetables is the palate cleanser you need to wash off all the fats and grease you’re consuming. Stick to green, leafy vegetable for fewer calories and more vitamins and minerals.</p>
<h3>Salad</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-5351 size-full" src="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/vegetable-salad-with-meat-strips-thanksgiving-calories-px.jpg?resize=625%2C400&#038;ssl=1" alt="Salad | How To Size Out Your Thanksgiving Calories" width="625" height="400" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/vegetable-salad-with-meat-strips-thanksgiving-calories-px.jpg?w=625&amp;ssl=1 625w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/vegetable-salad-with-meat-strips-thanksgiving-calories-px.jpg?resize=300%2C192&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><strong>Serving size:</strong> 1 cup (the size a baseball)</p>
<p><strong>Calories:</strong> 100-150 (depending on the dressing)</p>
<p>A cup of salad usually has around 100 to 150 calories. Keep in mind that most pre-packaged dressings are extremely high in calories.</p>
<p>To cut back on Thanksgiving calories, opt to use low-calorie cheese or vinaigrette instead of traditional dressings such as thousand island.</p>
<h3>Gravy</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-5352 size-full" src="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Close-up-of-Gravy-sauce-thanksgiving-calories-ss.jpg?resize=625%2C400&#038;ssl=1" alt="Gravy | How To Size Out Your Thanksgiving Calories" width="625" height="400" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Close-up-of-Gravy-sauce-thanksgiving-calories-ss.jpg?w=625&amp;ssl=1 625w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Close-up-of-Gravy-sauce-thanksgiving-calories-ss.jpg?resize=300%2C192&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><strong>Serving size:</strong> ¼ cup (the size of a golf ball)</p>
<p><strong>Calories:</strong> 30-50</p>
<p>Contrary to popular belief, gravy doesn’t contain that many calories. In fact, there are only around 30 to 50 calories in a ¼ cup of gravy.</p>
<p>Just make sure not to eat more than a cup to avoid consuming too much sodium.</p>
<h3>Cranberry Sauce</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-5353 size-full" src="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/roasted-fillet-of-turkey-with-cranberry-sauce-thanksgiving-calories-ss.jpg?resize=625%2C400&#038;ssl=1" alt="Cranberry Sauce | How To Size Out Your Thanksgiving Calories" width="625" height="400" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/roasted-fillet-of-turkey-with-cranberry-sauce-thanksgiving-calories-ss.jpg?w=625&amp;ssl=1 625w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/roasted-fillet-of-turkey-with-cranberry-sauce-thanksgiving-calories-ss.jpg?resize=300%2C192&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><strong>Serving size:</strong> ¼ cup (the size of a golf ball)</p>
<p><strong>Calories:</strong> 105</p>
<p>Cranberry sauce is another Thanksgiving favorite. However, when counting your Thanksgiving calories, keep in mind that cranberry sauce has more than double the amount of fat that gravy has.</p>
<h3>Stuffing</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-5354 size-full" src="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Homemade-Thanksgiving-Day-Stuffing-with-Sage-and-Celery-thanksgiving-calories-ss.jpg?resize=625%2C400&#038;ssl=1" alt="Stuffing | How To Size Out Your Thanksgiving Calories" width="625" height="400" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Homemade-Thanksgiving-Day-Stuffing-with-Sage-and-Celery-thanksgiving-calories-ss.jpg?w=625&amp;ssl=1 625w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Homemade-Thanksgiving-Day-Stuffing-with-Sage-and-Celery-thanksgiving-calories-ss.jpg?resize=300%2C192&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><strong>Serving size:</strong> ½ cup (the size of a standard ice cream scoop)</p>
<p><strong>Calories:</strong> 180</p>
<p>Try to keep your turkey stuffing down to less than half a cup. Going over that will just increase your Thanksgiving calories.</p>
<h3>Potatoes (Sweet or Mashed)</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-5355 size-full" src="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Mashed-potato-thanksgiving-calories-ss.jpg?resize=625%2C400&#038;ssl=1" alt="Potatoes (Sweet or Mashed) | How To Size Out Your Thanksgiving Calories" width="625" height="400" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Mashed-potato-thanksgiving-calories-ss.jpg?w=625&amp;ssl=1 625w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Mashed-potato-thanksgiving-calories-ss.jpg?resize=300%2C192&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><strong>Serving size:</strong> ½ cup (the size of half a tennis ball)</p>
<p><strong>Calories:</strong> 145</p>
<p>Sweet and mashed potatoes are a must at any Thanksgiving dinner. Luckily, you won’t consume too many carbs and calories if you only eat half a cup.</p>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> Don’t drown the potatoes in gravy. Doing so not only lessens the flavor, but it also adds unnecessary Thanksgiving calories.</p>
<h3>Cornbread (Without Butter)</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-5356 size-full" src="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Two-pieces-of-cornbread-on-a-white-plate-thanksgiving-calories-ss.jpg?resize=625%2C400&#038;ssl=1" alt="Cornbread (Without Butter) | How To Size Out Your Thanksgiving Calories" width="625" height="400" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Two-pieces-of-cornbread-on-a-white-plate-thanksgiving-calories-ss.jpg?w=625&amp;ssl=1 625w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Two-pieces-of-cornbread-on-a-white-plate-thanksgiving-calories-ss.jpg?resize=300%2C192&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><strong>Serving size:</strong> 1 medium muffin or square (the size of a bar of soap)</p>
<p><strong>Calories:</strong> 175</p>
<p>A serving of cornbread without butter has around 175 calories. It’s best to limit yourself to one piece of cornbread.</p>
<p>Think about it, this pastry has more calories than a serving of white meat turkey.</p>
<h3>Butter or Margarine</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-5357 size-full" src="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Piece-of-freshly-baked-cornbread-with-creamy-butter-on-top-thanksgiving-calories-ss.jpg?resize=625%2C400&#038;ssl=1" alt="Butter or Margarine | How To Size Out Your Thanksgiving Calories" width="625" height="400" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Piece-of-freshly-baked-cornbread-with-creamy-butter-on-top-thanksgiving-calories-ss.jpg?w=625&amp;ssl=1 625w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Piece-of-freshly-baked-cornbread-with-creamy-butter-on-top-thanksgiving-calories-ss.jpg?resize=300%2C192&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><strong>Serving size:</strong> 1 teaspoon (the size of a dice)</p>
<p><strong>Calories:</strong> 36</p>
<p>Adding a teaspoon of butter or margarine on your cornbread will lead to an extra 36 calories.</p>
<h3>Pie</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-5358 size-full" src="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/XQ5QWR8eZ5I-pumpkin-pie-thanksgiving-calories-us.jpg?resize=625%2C400&#038;ssl=1" alt="Pie | How To Size Out Your Thanksgiving Calories" width="625" height="400" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/XQ5QWR8eZ5I-pumpkin-pie-thanksgiving-calories-us.jpg?w=625&amp;ssl=1 625w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/XQ5QWR8eZ5I-pumpkin-pie-thanksgiving-calories-us.jpg?resize=300%2C192&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><strong>Serving size:</strong> ⅛ of a 9” pie (the size of a standard light bulb)</p>
<p><strong>Calories:</strong> 323 (pumpkin), 456 (pecan)</p>
<p>Thanksgiving day is the perfect opportunity for families to bust out their best pie recipe. However, if you want to cut back on the calories in your Thanksgiving dinner, stick to eating pumpkin pie.</p>
<p>But if you simply can’t resist the goodness of a pecan pie, just try to lessen the amount you’re eating.</p>
<h3>Drinks</h3>
<p>Let’s face it: no Thanksgiving dinner is complete without a few rounds of drinks. But keep in mind that alcoholic beverages add a ton to your Thanksgiving calories. Plus, they offer zero nutritional value.</p>
<p>However, Thanksgiving only comes once a year. So we can’t blame you for having a glass or two.</p>

<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-5361 size-full" src="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/champagne-pour-a-serve-thanksgiving-calories-pb.jpg?resize=625%2C400&#038;ssl=1" alt="Champagne | How To Size Out Your Thanksgiving Calories" width="625" height="400" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/champagne-pour-a-serve-thanksgiving-calories-pb.jpg?w=625&amp;ssl=1 625w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/champagne-pour-a-serve-thanksgiving-calories-pb.jpg?resize=300%2C192&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><strong>Calories</strong>: 78 per glass</p>
<p>Champagne drinks are very smooth and easy to drink. Plus, they only have 78 calories per glass. They&#8217;re the ideal alcoholic beverage to down this coming holiday season.</p>
<h3>Regular Beer</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-5362 size-full" src="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/alcoholic-beverage-bar-beer-drink-thanksgiving-calories-px.jpg?resize=625%2C400&#038;ssl=1" alt="Regular Beer | How To Size Out Your Thanksgiving Calories" width="625" height="400" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/alcoholic-beverage-bar-beer-drink-thanksgiving-calories-px.jpg?w=625&amp;ssl=1 625w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/alcoholic-beverage-bar-beer-drink-thanksgiving-calories-px.jpg?resize=300%2C192&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><strong>Calories:</strong> 150 per bottle</p>
<p>Many of us are too lazy to do anything other than pop open a bottle of beer. But if you want to stick to your fitness goals, it&#8217;s best to lay off the regular beer this Thanksgiving.</p>
<h3>Light Beer</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-5363 size-full" src="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Light-beer-mug-against-the-backdrop-of-the-bar-shelf-thanksgiving-calories-ss.jpg?resize=625%2C400&#038;ssl=1" alt="Light Beer | How To Size Out Your Thanksgiving Calories" width="625" height="400" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Light-beer-mug-against-the-backdrop-of-the-bar-shelf-thanksgiving-calories-ss.jpg?w=625&amp;ssl=1 625w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Light-beer-mug-against-the-backdrop-of-the-bar-shelf-thanksgiving-calories-ss.jpg?resize=300%2C192&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><strong>Calories:</strong> 95 per bottle</p>
<p>If you really don&#8217;t want to drink anything other than beer, don&#8217;t worry! Opt for light beer instead. It packs as much punch and flavor as regular beer minus the extra calories and carbs.</p>
<h3>Generic Cocktail</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-5364 size-full" src="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/eN6_2u8Pcrc-cocktail-thanksgiving-calories-us.jpg?resize=625%2C400&#038;ssl=1" alt="Generic Cocktail | How To Size Out Your Thanksgiving Calories" width="625" height="400" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/eN6_2u8Pcrc-cocktail-thanksgiving-calories-us.jpg?w=625&amp;ssl=1 625w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/eN6_2u8Pcrc-cocktail-thanksgiving-calories-us.jpg?resize=300%2C192&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><strong>Calories:</strong> 155 per glass</p>

<p>This is just a simple guide you can use to keep track of your Thanksgiving calories. Overall, whole grains, fruits, and vegetables should make up the biggest part of your meal.</p>
<p>Also, remember to do some <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/full-body-workout-for-weight-loss/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">full-body exercises</a> the day after Thanksgiving. It’ll help you sweat out the calories, cholesterol, and alcohol you consumed the night before.</p>

<h2>Best Way to Get Rid of Belly Fat | 10 Foods to Avoid</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>1. Full-Fat Dairy Products</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-4402 size-full" src="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/selective-focus-photo-of-cheese-best-way-to-get-rid-of-belly-fat-px.jpg?resize=625%2C400&#038;ssl=1" alt="Full-Fat Dairy Products | Foods to Avoid for a Flat Stomach |best way to get rid of belly fat" width="625" height="400" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/selective-focus-photo-of-cheese-best-way-to-get-rid-of-belly-fat-px.jpg?w=625&amp;ssl=1 625w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/selective-focus-photo-of-cheese-best-way-to-get-rid-of-belly-fat-px.jpg?resize=300%2C192&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>Full-fat dairy products are very high in calories and saturated fat. Be careful when buying products such as cheese, milk, and yogurt.</p>
<p>The next time you go shopping for dairy products, choose low-fat items instead. Additionally, opt to get your calcium from green leafy vegetables instead of full-fat dairy goods.</p>
<h3>2. Refined Carbohydrates</h3>
<p>A good way to get<a href="https://vshred.com/blog/how-to-get-a-flat-stomach/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> rid of belly fat</a> is to avoid foods with refined carbs, also known as &#8220;simple&#8221; carbs. They promote inflammation and weight gain. Plus, refined carbs spike your sugar levels.</p>
<p>Replace these foods with whole-grain, fiber-enriched foods instead, also known as &#8220;complex&#8221; carbs.</p>
<h3>3. Fried Foods</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-4403 size-full" src="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/potato-fries-with-fried-meat-on-white-plate-best-way-to-get-rid-of-belly-fat-px.jpg?resize=625%2C400&#038;ssl=1" alt="Fried Foods | Foods to Avoid for a Flat Stomach | best way to get rid of belly fat" width="625" height="400" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/potato-fries-with-fried-meat-on-white-plate-best-way-to-get-rid-of-belly-fat-px.jpg?w=625&amp;ssl=1 625w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/potato-fries-with-fried-meat-on-white-plate-best-way-to-get-rid-of-belly-fat-px.jpg?resize=300%2C192&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>One way to lose belly fat naturally is to avoid frying your food using cooking oil.</p>
<p>Due to its high-fat content, it takes much longer to digest these types of food. Plus, excessive amounts can lead to digestive tract complications such as acid reflux and heartburn.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re able to, choose to bake your meals instead of frying them. Switching to olive, coconut, or avocado oil will allow you to increase the amount of polyunsaturated and monounsaturated (healthy) fats in your diet while limiting the amount of saturated and trans fats in your diet.</p>
<h3>4. Candy and Soda</h3>
<p>These sugar-filled treats are full of empty calories. They offer no nutritional value so the body stores them as fat.</p>
<p>If you’re a fan of diet sodas, you might want to reconsider your choice of drink. It’s no healthier than regular soda and only increases your cravings for sweets.</p>
<p>To satisfy your sweet tooth, drink a glass of fruit-infused water instead. Add some slices of lemons and cucumbers for a cool, refreshing, and healthy alternative to soda and sweets.</p>
<h3>5. Alcohol</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-4404 size-full" src="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/clear-drinking-glass-best-way-to-get-rid-of-belly-fat-px.jpg?resize=625%2C400&#038;ssl=1" alt="Alcohol | Foods to Avoid for a Flat Stomach | best way to get rid of belly fat" width="625" height="400" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/clear-drinking-glass-best-way-to-get-rid-of-belly-fat-px.jpg?w=625&amp;ssl=1 625w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/clear-drinking-glass-best-way-to-get-rid-of-belly-fat-px.jpg?resize=300%2C192&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>If you really want to lose stubborn belly fat fast, then you need to avoid alcoholic drinks.</p>
<p>Similar to sodas, they’re filled with empty calories that offer zero nutritional value. Plus, it slows down your body’s fat-burning process.</p>
<p>If you’re going to drink alcohol, choose beverages with lower calories such as wine. Also, remember to drink water in between shots to prevent over-consumption. It’s also a great way to avoid a painful hangover.</p>
<h3>6. Salted Snacks</h3>
<p>To rid your body of fat, you need to avoid salted snacks such as potato chips. Salt retains water which makes you feel bloated and gain weight.</p>
<p>Choose <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/healthy-snacking-snack-options/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">healthier snacks</a> such as nuts, veggie slices, and whole grain crackers instead.</p>
<h3>7. Natural and Artificial Sweeteners</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-4405 size-full" src="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/beverages-cold-colourful-best-way-to-get-rid-of-belly-fat-px.jpg?resize=625%2C400&#038;ssl=1" alt="Natural and Artificial Sweeteners | Foods to Avoid for a Flat Stomach | best way to get rid of belly fat" width="625" height="400" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/beverages-cold-colourful-best-way-to-get-rid-of-belly-fat-px.jpg?w=625&amp;ssl=1 625w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/beverages-cold-colourful-best-way-to-get-rid-of-belly-fat-px.jpg?resize=300%2C192&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>Avoid processed foods with artificial sugars and high-fructose corn syrup. Similarly, fruit juices contain massive amounts of calories that may end up being stored as belly fat.</p>
<p>The best thing to do is to eliminate all processed foods from your diet. Then, instead of drinking fruit drinks, eat the fruits whole and fresh. Also, it’s best to juice vegetables for a refreshing, healthy drink.</p>
<h3>8. Diet Foods</h3>
<p>One of the best tips for losing belly fat is to steer clear of diet foods. Diet meals and shakes may contain heaps of sodium and preservatives. Also, some protein bars have a higher calorie-content than chocolate bars. If you&#8217;re going to consume protein bars, look for protein bars with less than 6 grams of sugar.</p>
<p>One of the best ways to lose belly fat is to make your own diet meals and protein bars instead. Choose all-natural ingredients brimming with vitamins and nutrients.</p>
<h3>9. Processed Meat</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-4406 size-full" src="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/grilling-sausages-best-way-to-get-rid-of-belly-fat-px.jpg?resize=625%2C400&#038;ssl=1" alt="Processed Meat | Foods to Avoid for a Flat Stomach | best way to get rid of belly fat" width="625" height="400" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/grilling-sausages-best-way-to-get-rid-of-belly-fat-px.jpg?w=625&amp;ssl=1 625w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/grilling-sausages-best-way-to-get-rid-of-belly-fat-px.jpg?resize=300%2C192&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>Processed meats such as bacon, cold cuts, and hotdogs have high levels of saturated fats and calories. Excessive consumption might put you at risk of heart disease and stroke.</p>
<p>Ditch the processed foods and switch to fresh meat instead. But keep in mind that you should also observe moderation when eating fresh meat.</p>
<h3>10. Pre-Packaged Salads</h3>
<p>While vegetables are healthy, the dressings that come with pre-packaged salads are high in trans fat and calories. The same goes for sides such as cheese and croutons.</p>
<p>If you want to achieve a shredded physique, drop the salad dressings. Make your own using lemon juice, non-fat yogurt, and vinaigrette instead.</p>

<div id="what" class="anchor"></div>
<h3>What Are Calories?</h3>
<p>Calories are units of energy measurement. Foods, drinks, supplements, and even condiments all contain calories. We can also measure how much energy we use by counting the calories we burn in a day.</p>
<p>If you want to achieve your fitness goals, you need to be mindful of how many calories you consume in a single day. Remember: to lose weight, the basic rule is to be in caloric deficit &#8211; eat fewer calories than you burn.</p>

<h3>How Many Calories Should I Eat to Lose Weight?</h3>
<p>The amount of calories you need to eat depends on a number of different factors including your age, weight, body, gender, and activity level. That being said, each person has unique individual attributes that are the basis of caloric needs and consumption.</p>
<p>The average female requires approximately 2,000 calories per day, while males generally require around 2,500 calories. With these basic needs in mind, to maintain weight, a female should target a diet consisting of 2000 calories and males should consume 2500 calories.</p>
<p>With respect to weight loss, being in a caloric deficit is the goal. In general, a healthy deficit is 300-500 calories below an individual&#8217;s caloric needs. Considering the above information, women should target 1500-1700 calories per day and men should target 2000-2200 calories per day.</p>

<h3>How Do I Keep Track Of The Number Of Calories I Consume?</h3>
<p><!-- instagram error: invalid instagram resource --></p>
<p>If you want a more accurate number to follow, you can use a calorie calculator. There are plenty of online calculators that can help you determine how much you need to eat to lose weight and maintain lean muscle.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that these are just tools to help you count your calories. They can assist you in creating a fitness plan, but they won’t be your complete diet guide.</p>

<h3>How Many Calories Should I Eat to Lose Weight Without Exercise?</h3>
<p>While you may be able to shed off a few pounds through calorie-restriction alone, you’ll also be sacrificing lean muscle by doing so. If you want to achieve a lean, fit body, you need to combine proper diet with <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/best-workout-to-lose-weight-in-only-4-minutes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">regular exercise</a>.</p>
<div id="can" class="anchor"></div>
<h3>How Can I Lose Weight Without Starving Myself?</h3>
<p>The best way to still feel full even if you&#8217;re cutting back on calories is to avoid junk foods that offer zero nutrients. Chips, cakes, and beer contain empty calories that don’t provide any nutritional value.</p>
<p>If you want to feel full even on a low-calorie diet, opt to eat healthier meals with vitamins and nutrients. Also, replace sugary drinks such as sodas and juices with water, black coffee, or unsweetened tea.</p>
<p>Additionally, proteins and healthy fats help satiate the human body, meaning that consumption of protein-rich and healthy fatty foods will help to keep you fuller for longer periods of time.</p>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> A good way to avoid unhealthy snacking is to prepare your meals ahead of time. This is what we call <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/meal-plan-lose-weight/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">meal prepping</a>.</p>
<p>Having your meals prepped and ready to grab and go often helps individuals stick to a plan and improves their will-power to abstain from snacking on simple, empty calorie snacks.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Knowing what to eat after a workout is crucial, no matter what your fitness goal is. Your post-workout meal should be composed of foods that are easy to digest for faster nutrient absorption.</p>
<p>In addition, you need to consume it within 30 minutes after your workout for increased protein synthesis and glycogen storage. Your meal should be a combination of healthy fats, carbs, and protein. Check out these healthy and easy-to-make post-workout meals you can prepare for your next workout!</p>
<h2>What to Eat After a Workout: 7 Meals You Should Try!</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span style="color: #000080;">1. Rice Crackers and Peanut Butter</span></h3>
<p>For a quick, simple post-workout meal, you can opt for some rice crackers and peanut butter. This meal contains enough nutrients to ensure your body’s muscle recovery.</p>
<p>In fact, 100 grams of peanut butter has 25g of protein, 50g of fat, and 20g of carbohydrates. In addition, this meal does not require you to do any preparation. Just bring a jar of peanut butter and some rice crackers to the gym to be eaten after your workout.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #000080;">2. Protein Shake and Banana</span></h3>
<p>If you can’t decide on what to eat after a workout, then you can stick to the basic protein shake and banana combo. This proven combo is designed specifically for quick nutrient absorption during your anabolic window.</p>
<p>Throw in a scoop or two of your favorite protein powder into a cup, shake it, then have a banana to go with it. In under 10 minutes, you’ll have consumed enough nutrients to promote muscle growth and recovery.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #000080;">3. Avocado, Toast, and Eggs</span></h3>
<p>Eggs are praised in the fitness industry for their versatility and nutritional value. In fact, 100 grams of eggs have 13g of protein, 11g of fat, and only 155 calories.</p>
<p>Serve these eggs any way you want <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/healthy-snack-ideas-delicious-healthy-low-carb-meal-in-only-15-minutes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">alongside some avocados and toast</a> and you&#8217;ll have a delicious nutrient-packed post-workout meal.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #000080;">4. Cereal and Milk</span></h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-1657 size-full" src="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/cereals-strawberries-milk-what-to-eat-after-workout-US.jpg?resize=625%2C417&#038;ssl=1" alt="Cereal and Milk | What To Eat After A Workout | Food Options Post-Workout" width="625" height="417" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/cereals-strawberries-milk-what-to-eat-after-workout-US.jpg?w=625&amp;ssl=1 625w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/cereals-strawberries-milk-what-to-eat-after-workout-US.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>Do you know what to eat after a workout that requires virtually no preparation? Your favorite breakfast duo, cereal and milk, can actually be eaten at any time of the day.</p>
<p>For better nutrient consumption, you want to go for a brand that’s rich in protein and fiber but has low sugar content.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #000080;">5. Greek Yogurt, Berries, and Granola</span></h3>
<p><a href="https://vshred.com/blog/healthy-weight-loss-meals/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Greek yogurt</a> has less sugar and more protein than regular yogurt. This makes it an ideal component of your post-workout meal! If you have a cup of Greek yogurt, you don’t have to wonder about what to eat after a workout.</p>
<p>Just throw in some berries and granola in your Greek yogurt, and you&#8217;ll have a quick and easy post-workout meal.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #000080;">6. Grilled Chicken With Roasted Vegetables</span></h3>
<p>If you’re the type who prepares their meals in advance, then one post-workout meal you can try is grilled chicken with roasted vegetables. The chicken gives you the protein and fat you need while the vegetables provide you with minerals.</p>
<p>Grill a few pounds of chicken and veggies and put them in different containers to bring with you to eat after your workout.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #000080;">7. Cottage Cheese and Fruits</span></h3>
<p>If you ask a random gym-goer what to eat after a workout, they’ll most likely say something that involves either cottage cheese or fruits. Eating cottage cheese and fruits after a workout give you the protein, minerals, and carbohydrates you need for muscle growth. How much protein does it have? 226 grams of cottage cheese has around 28g of protein and only 163 calories.</p>
<p>On the other hand, fruits are packed with healthy and easy-to-digest carbohydrates.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Your pre-workout meal is just as important as your post-workout meal. Watch this video by V Shred about making a quick, healthy meal:</strong></p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='1170' height='659' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/lvto3DdoUVM?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></p>
<p>What you eat after a workout is as important as the workout itself. Stuffing your body with unhealthy foods will only put your hours of hard work at the gym to waste.</p>
<p>If you want to maximize the results of your training, you need to fuel your body with the right nutrients. Whether it’s to build muscles, lose fat, or maintain an active body, it’s very important to be mindful of what to eat after a workout.</p>
