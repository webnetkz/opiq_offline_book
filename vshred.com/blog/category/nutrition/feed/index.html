That is a scary number!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Good thing you found this article because </span><b><i>we aren’t going to let YOU be “most” people! </i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lower temps do not have to equal larger waistlines! You just have to have a plan! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this short read we will &#8230;</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Explain why winter weight gain happens. Knowing why is important if you want to prevent it and the reason is probably not what you think. In fact, it is partially not even your fault!</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tell you why fall/winter is actually the BEST time to start a diet and training plan.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Give you 7 easy pro tips that will help guide you through the next few months. </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You may believe winter weight gain happens because of the holidays. Those extra home cooked meals and holiday parties are certainly a factor. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But </span><b><i>there is a DAILY issue you need to be prepared to fight </i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">if you want to avoid packing on winter pounds.</span></p>
<p><b>WHY YOU REALLY PACK ON POUNDS AFTER LABOR DAY</b></p>
<p><img class="size-large wp-image-7471" src="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_130930953.jpeg?resize=1024%2C512&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="512" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_130930953.jpeg?resize=1024%2C512&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_130930953.jpeg?resize=300%2C150&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_130930953.jpeg?resize=768%2C384&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_130930953.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_130930953.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the spring and summer months, you are given what we call a</span><b> fitness freebie. </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You get a </span><b><i>seasonal motivation boost</i></b> <span style="font-weight: 400;">that doesn’t happen when temperatures start to drop, and you begin to pull out the chunky sweaters and comfy leggings. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not only is the sun shining (which makes you happier because of Vitamin D), you are wearing LESS clothing in the summer months. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I don’t know about you, but knowing I’m going to be exposing more skin makes walking in the gym a little easier. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Covering up in layers, no doubt leads to the temptation to slack on body goals! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Knowing your arms, legs, and abs will be less exposed can easily be an excuse to slack. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, being layered up often means you don’t SEE the extra pounds, so they are easier to ignore.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But there is more to it than being bundled up….</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-7477" src="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_236518834.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_236518834.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_236518834.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_236518834.jpeg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_236518834.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_236518834.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span>The #1 reason you slack on health and fitness goals in colder months ISN’T EVEN YOUR FAULT!!</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, you have a part to play in all of this, but</span><b><i> there is actually a scientific reason why you have less desire to train and eat healthy when the sunshine of summer fades.</i></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We will explain why a little further down. But ya know what really stinks? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The scientific reason why we all experience these motivation slumps in the winter only adds to an even bigger issue with motivation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span>It doesn’t matter what season it is motivation ALWAYS comes and goes!</p>
<p>Spring, Summer, Fall, or Winter &#8211; you can NEVER rely on it!</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, what can you do when lack of sunshine and warm temps leave you even more tempted to hit snooze and reach for comfort foods? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You certainly don’t throw your hands up in the air and wait until January to make a resolution to crash diet to get your body ready for spring. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Believe it or not, RIGHT NOW is actually the IDEAL time to get started! </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you </span><b><i>START NOW, </i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">you will develop discipline and a routine heading into the holidays. This will put you in a great place mentally and physically to relax and “indulge” a little more at all those holiday gatherings! </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><b><i>Look at it this way ..<br />
</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Would you rather head into the holiday season already making progress toward your goals and be in a great spot <em>(where it would be okay even if you did gain an extra pound or two?)</em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Or would you rather put it off and only add more fat on top of what you want to lose?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The answer is clear— the solution to getting the motivation needed to make it happen, not so much.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But don’t worry! We’ve got ya covered</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (no pun intended)</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with a few easy motivation hacks!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><b>7 TIPS TO STAY MOTIVATED AS SEASONS CHANGE</b></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><b><br />
</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the number one questions we always get is … “<em>I am just not motivated. How can I motivate myself to train and eat better?”</em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As we mentioned earlier, it doesn&#8217;t matter what season it is, </span><b><i>you can’t always rely on motivation. </i></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you have it, great! You should certainly take advantage of it! But you have to know that it is totally normal to not have much of it. Even professional athletes lack motivation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You have to develop other daily habits that create discipline if you want to succeed long term!</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are a few of our pro tips that we use with our clients, specifically when temperatures drop, and motivation seems to be at its lowest! </span></p>
<p><b>TIP #1: Switch To An At Home Training Program</b></p>
<p><img class="size-large wp-image-7448" src="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_185038762.jpeg?resize=1024%2C647&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="647" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_185038762.jpeg?resize=1024%2C647&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_185038762.jpeg?resize=300%2C189&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_185038762.jpeg?resize=768%2C485&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_185038762.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_185038762.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you know that getting out of bed and stepping into the winter elements is going to be an excuse trigger, make a plan to train at home during cooler months! Some of the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">most effective and challenging workouts </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">only require your body weight and </span><b><i>maybe</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a set of dumbbells or some resistance bands.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A good fat-blasting, muscle-building sweat session can 100% be achieved from the comfort of your home!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adjustable dumbbells, ankle weights, resistance bands, a jump rope, etc., are all things that are inexpensive and can easily be stored in a closet or under your bed and pulled out anytime you don’t feel like leaving the house.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But if you have </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">the right training program</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><b><i>you don’t need any of that. </i></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our favorite </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">at-home bodyweight-only program</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is called</span><b> MOVE. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was designed to help you achieve your fitness goals without a single piece of equipment, and each workout is under 20 minutes! </span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Learn more about MOVE by watching the video below!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you need </span><b>a little extra “nudge”</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to get up and get moving, another </span><b>pro-tip we use</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is keeping some </span><a href="https://sculptnation.com/products/pre-workout" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><b>PRE WORKOUT </b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">on your bedside table. Have it already blended up and chug it as soon as your alarm goes off!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By the time you have brushed your teeth and put on your workout clothes, you will have a nice little jolt of energy and</span><b><i> tons of motivation</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to get going before you have a chance to come up with an excuse! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the bottom of this article, we will tell you about a big end of summer sale happening so that you can stock up on our </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">favorite </span><a href="https://sculptnation.com/products/pre-workout" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><b>PRE WORKOUT</b></a><strong> for 40% off when you use code: LABORDAY40 at checkout! </strong></p>
<p><b>TIP #2: Make Your Workouts Seasonal</b></p>
<p><img class="size-large wp-image-7452" src="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_65703942.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_65703942.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_65703942.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_65703942.jpeg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_65703942.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_65703942.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Embrace the change of seasons and take advantage of activities that you can only do in fall or winter! </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Go on a fall hike and view all the gorgeous foliage.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Try rock climbing.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Walk around a corn maze or pumpkin patch with your family. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you live in a snowy climate, go skiing, sledding, build snowmen with your kids, etc.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Go ice skating.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lace-up your sneakers, go for a walk or run at night, and admire all the Christmas lights and decorations.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are some things you can only do and see during specific times of the year. So instead of missing sunshine and water sports, focus on all the positive things that only come about with cooler temps!</span></p>
<p><b>TIP #3: Try Something Totally New</b></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-7454" src="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_361152601.jpeg?resize=1024%2C514&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="514" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_361152601.jpeg?resize=1024%2C514&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_361152601.jpeg?resize=300%2C151&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_361152601.jpeg?resize=768%2C386&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_361152601.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_361152601.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sometimes a change of routine is all you need to boost motivation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you have been doing all your gym lifts alone, recruit a gym buddy! Try switching up your cardio by skipping your solo runs and joining a group fitness class instead. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another option is to </span><b><i>allow yourself to slow down!</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> If you have been crushing it all spring and summer with intense training and hardcore workouts, </span><b><i>it may actually be time to take it down a notch. </i></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Going full force 365 can cause your stress hormone cortisol to increase. This can lead to a host of drawbacks, including weight gain, muscle loss, poor moods, fatigue, and occasional issues sleeping! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We aren’t saying you should become lazy! But if you have been crushing it 24/7 all spring and summer, your body (and mind) may need to slow down.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Use the next few months to embrace a slower routine. </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Commit to daily yoga.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Focus on becoming more flexible.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Switch to low or moderate-intensity cardio, instead of HIIT.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Try out some bodyweight workouts instead of heavy lifting.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Giving your body a couple of months to recover might even make you more responsive when you decide to kick things up again come spring/summer!</span></p>
<p><b>TIP #4: Stay Accountable</b></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-7457" src="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_266584820.jpeg?resize=1024%2C768&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="768" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_266584820.jpeg?resize=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_266584820.jpeg?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_266584820.jpeg?resize=768%2C576&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_266584820.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_266584820.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><b><br />
</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">The best way to stick to a plan is to have someone that you report back to. This could be a friend, family member, a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">social media community</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, or even a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">coach. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Including someone else, or even just telling someone else about your health and fitness goals and asking them to check in with you to make sure you are sticking to the plan, is a great way to keep the promises you make to yourself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you prefer to fly solo, it helps to create visuals. Make a vision board, create a daily checklist you can mark off after each workout, or keep an accomplishment journal.</span></p>
<p><b>TIP #5: Set A Spring Goal</b></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-7458" src="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_47332240.jpeg?resize=1024%2C680&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="680" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_47332240.jpeg?resize=1024%2C680&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_47332240.jpeg?resize=300%2C199&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_47332240.jpeg?resize=768%2C510&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_47332240.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_47332240.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">March may seem like a long time away, but it will be back before you know it, and 6 months is a long time to make significant changes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Setting a goal is a great way to encourage yourself to push past discomforts and temptation, but there is a science to goal setting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The key to creating goals that stick .. </span><b><i>be REALISTIC and SPECIFIC!</i></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s start with </span><b><i>reality. </i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">You should always focus on one goal at a time and make sure you are being honest with yourself if that goal is really attainable.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you know that your schedule will never allow you to work out 6 days a week, why would you choose a program that requires you to do that?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you know it’s not healthy to attempt to lose 10 pounds a week, why would you aim that high?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you love carbs, why would you go on a KETO diet? </span></p>
<p><b><i>Doing these things will essentially set yourself up for failure.</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Set attainable goals that fit YOUR lifestyle. You can always bump things up if your schedule allows, or you notice you aren’t pushing yourself hard enough. Just keep in mind that being realistic isn’t the same as not believing in yourself or making excuses. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moving on to being </span><b><i>specific.</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The more specific you are about your goals, the more likely you will be to reach them. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It may seem like it’s good enough to say things like .. I want to look good, lose weight, or get ripped! </span><b><i>But you have to dig deeper than that!! </i></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wanting to “lose weight,” for example, is an excellent place to start. But ask yourself what that means to you?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you expand on that and say &#8212; “I want to lose 10 pounds of fat. I will do this by not eating any sweets and doing the V Shred </span><a href="https://vshred.com/sp/move/soc-all/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><b>MOVE </b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">program for 30 consecutive days. I am doing this because I want to have better self-esteem and a head start on bikini season.” &#8212; that makes your goal more specific.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The more specific (and attainable) your goals are, the more likely you will be to not give up!</span></p>
<p><b>TIP #6: Reward Yourself</b></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-7459" src="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/vin_sant_32048508_366936073798151_433609263865135104_n.jpg?resize=882%2C1024&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="882" height="1024" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/vin_sant_32048508_366936073798151_433609263865135104_n.jpg?resize=882%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 882w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/vin_sant_32048508_366936073798151_433609263865135104_n.jpg?resize=258%2C300&amp;ssl=1 258w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/vin_sant_32048508_366936073798151_433609263865135104_n.jpg?resize=768%2C892&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/vin_sant_32048508_366936073798151_433609263865135104_n.jpg?w=1080&amp;ssl=1 1080w" sizes="(max-width: 882px) 100vw, 882px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you have checked a “mini goal” off your list, treat yourself. Knowing that you have a reward coming to celebrate your efforts will make you want to achieve it even more. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It may be tempting to make your reward one of your favorite “forbidden foods” but we never suggest that you reward yourself this way.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You aren’t a dog. You should never reward “good behavior” with food. Having this mentality can create a really unhealthy relationship with food.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You need to eat healthy MOST of the time, control your portions, and see food as fuel. But if you are craving something that isn’t quite as healthy as your grilled chicken and rice, never feel like you need to lose 20 pounds to “deserve” a bite of cake, or nice dinner out with your family. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instead of rewarding yourself with food, buy yourself something you have been wanting. Maybe some new workout clothes, a massage, or an extra $20 bucks in your vacation fund! </span></p>

<p><b>TIP #7: Make Mental Health Top Priority</b></p>
<p><img class="size-large wp-image-7460" src="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_255894146.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_255894146.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_255894146.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_255894146.jpeg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_255894146.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_255894146.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Earlier, we mentioned that cold weather motivation dips may not be your fault.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’m sure you have heard of winter blues. Well, it’s a real thing. Less natural light can cause dips in serotonin, the neurotransmitter that regulates mood.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The dark and dreary days of winter can also cause your body to produce more of the sleep hormone melatonin. This shift can disrupt your body and impact your sleep patterns and overall mood.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are a few ways that you can focus on improving your mental health.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Invest in a light therapy box that simulates natural daylight.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Make sure you are supplementing with or eating plenty of foods with Vitamin D.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Start journaling. There is a lot of scientific evidence that supports putting your thoughts on paper provides a long list of benefits, including stress management, self-confidence, and goal setting. </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Suppose you still find yourself struggling with negative seasonal motivation shifts. In that case, you may need to experiment with taking</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> naturally sourced herbs</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to help support brain health and a positive mood.</span></p>
<p><b><i>Here are a few with some great scientific backing to help boost mood.</i></b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>EnXtra: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">A natural caffeine-free patent-pending botanical ingredient that has been shown to help increase dopamine levels.**It is also one of the first and only natural caffeine-free patent-pending botanical ingredients shown to boost mental alertness &amp; acuity for hours or ending in a huge caffeine energy crash.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Piper Nigrum Fruit Extract:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> A very specific type of black pepper that has been shown to help increase both serotonin and dopamine.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>L-Theanine:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> A powerful amino acid that is believed to help reduce occasional anxiety brought on by stressful situations.</span></li>
</ul>

<p><b><i>BOTTOM LINE IF YOU WANT TO STAY MOTIVATED YEAR ROUND</i></b><b><i><br />
</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you put away the shorts and swimsuits and shift out of bikini season, it’s common for motivation to “fall back” with the clocks. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The seasons have to change (unless you live near the equator) &#8211; so you have to figure out ways to</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">not let your fitness goals go into hibernation mode!</span><b><i> </i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pumpkin spice lattes are only here for a limited time, but getting into shape isn’t seasonal! </span><i>It&#8217;s a year-round commitment!!</i><i> </i></p>

<p><strong>RECIPE 1: CAULIFLOWER BUNS</strong><br />
*Servings will vary pending the size you want to make your buns*</p>
<p>Using cauliflower instead of bread may sound unappealing, but with the right recipe, you won’t notice the cauliflower taste. You will only be left with hundreds of calories that you can use somewhere else (like on our healthy protein apple pie or sugar free jello shots.)</p>
<p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>1 (12 oz) bag cauliflower rice</li>
<li>1 egg white</li>
<li>1 tbsp coconut flour</li>
<li>1/4 tsp salt</li>
<li>1-1/2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
<li>1 tsp each of any other seasonings you want your bun to taste like!</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Directions:</strong><br />
Steam the cauliflower according to the package; drain until ALL WATER IS REMOVED (this is key) and let cool. You may want to use a cheesecloth or dry paper towels to make sure ALL water is removed.</p>
<p>Whisk together the coconut flour, baking powder, seasonings, add the cauliflower mixture, and egg white. Stirring until blended. If the batter is too dry, try adding teaspoons of unsweetened nut milk, or even water, to reach desired consistency.</p>
<p>There are several methods you can use to make your buns! Here are a few!</p>
<p><em><strong>Muffin Tins</strong></em><br />
Distribute evenly into muffin tins. Bake in the preheated oven for 40 to 45 minutes until golden brown at edges and centers feel set when lightly touched. Transfer to a cooling rack and let cool completely before removing. Slice them in half and serve up!</p>
<p><em><strong>QUICK TIP</strong></em> … You can also use this batter and pour it directly into a small sprayed skillet .. in a mini-waffle or pancake maker .. or even in the microwave!!</p>
<p><em><strong>For the microwave version&#8230;</strong> </em><br />
Pour a couple of inches of batter into a deep coffee mug. The larger it is, the better, unless you are eating a tiny patty of meat. Microwave time will vary, but zap it about 45 seconds and see if it’s ready. If not, keep adding 10 seconds at a time until done!</p>
<p>Don’t overcook, or it will be too dry. Dump out of the mug .. let cool .. cut in half …. Enjoy!</p>
<p><em><strong>TIP</strong></em> .. if they still don’t seem “toasted” enough. You can always throw them on the grill, put them in a toaster oven, or even an air-fryer!</p>

<p><strong>RECIPE 2: FIRECRACKER GRILLED SALMON</strong><br />
You may not think of salmon as being a 4th of July staple, but eating this super healthy fish on Independence Day .. is a tradition in New England!</p>
<p>According to history buffs, it started by coincidence. During the mid-summer months, salmon was plentiful in that region. Because it was “in season” &#8211; it always ended up on the dinner table for Independence Day! Even though salmon is available year-round now, the holiday tradition of eating salmon on the 4th remains to be a big deal there!</p>
<p>If you want to celebrate like the New Englanders .. this grilled salmon recipe is tasty, tangy, and packs just enough heat. The only calories it packs on, are from heart-healthy Omega 3’s!</p>
<p>The calorie content in salmon can be well over 300 calories, or as low as well under 200 calories.<br />
You want to always buy salmon labeled wild” and not farmed.</p>
<p>Wild salmon has fewer calories and half the fat content of the same amount of farmed salmon, and it is better for you.</p>
<p>While farmed salmon is sometimes praised for having slightly more omega-3 fatty acids, it is also very high in saturated fat &#8211; which is a type of fat you do not want.</p>
<p>Farmed salmon is also known for having more unsafe contaminants, chemicals from polluted waters, and other pollutants. Farmed salmon comes with the potential of antibiotic use.<br />
Wild salmon does not.</p>
<p>Some good choices would be WILD sockeye (red), king, keta, coho, or atlantic.</p>
<p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>4 (4-6 ounce) wild salmon fillets</li>
<li>⅛ -¼ cup peanut oil</li>
<li>2 tablespoons soy sauce (or coconut aminos)</li>
<li>2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar</li>
<li>2 tablespoons green onions, chopped</li>
<li>1 teaspoon brown sugar</li>
<li>1 cloves garlic, minced</li>
<li>½-1 teaspoon ground ginger</li>
<li>1 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes</li>
<li>½ teaspoon sesame oil</li>
<li>Pinch of salt</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Directions:</strong><br />
Place salmon fillets in a glass dish.</p>
<p>In a separate bowl, combine the peanut oil, soy sauce, vinegar, green onions, brown sugar, garlic, ginger, red pepper flakes, sesame oil, and salt. Whisk well and pour over the fish.</p>
<p>Cover and let marinate in the refrigerator for at least 4 to 6 hours.</p>
<p>Transfer filets to aluminum foil and place them on the grill.</p>
<p>Grill 10 minutes per inch of thickness. Turn over halfway through cooking.</p>
<p>*With any meat, it is best to use a food thermometer to ensure you do not under-cook or overcook for your liking. For salmon, it is re</p>
<p>commended the internal temp reach 145. Keep in mind that meat will continue to cook just a tad after it leaves the grill*</p>
<p>If you want to really keep with New England tradition, pair your salmon with some peas! They ate salmon with this nutritious veggie .. because it too .. was in season at the time!</p>

<p>Grilling your veggies is one of the healthiest side-dishes you can enjoy at your cookout. Put them on a kabob, throw them in some aluminum foil, or put them straight on the grill… no oil needed!</p>
<p>Many veggies do well on the grill, but a few really shine!</p>
<p>Asparagus, eggplant, mushrooms, onions, zucchini, eggplant, and bell peppers are excellent options!</p>
<p>Of course, you can’t go wrong with some corn on the cob. Just keep in in mind that corn is a vegetable that is higher in carbs!</p>

<p><strong>RECIPE 5: HEALTHY POTATO SALAD</strong><br />
<strong>(Approx 8 Servings)</strong><br />
Traditional potato salad is drowning in high fat mayonnaise! This recipe lightens things up by using non-fat greek yogurt! We promise that making this smart swap will not compromise any of the flavor in this popular BBQ side dish. Go with one type of potato, or use a colorful medley, if you want to go with a “red-white-blue” theme!</p>
<p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>2 pounds russet, yukon gold, or red potatoes.</li>
<li>1 tablespoon salt (for cooking potatoes)</li>
<li>½ cup plain, non-fat, greek yogurt</li>
<li>2 tablespoons fat-free or light mayonnaise</li>
<li>1 teaspoon dijon mustard</li>
<li>¾ teaspoons salt</li>
<li>½ teaspoon black pepper</li>
<li>½ teaspoon onion powder</li>
<li>½ cup chopped celery</li>
<li>3 tablespoons pickle relish (or pickles)</li>
<li>2 tablespoons minced red onions</li>
<li>2 tablespoons minced parsley or dill</li>
<li>2 hard-boiled eggs</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Instructions:</strong><br />
Peeled and cut the potatoes into approx ¾-inch cubes.<br />
Place in a saucepan covered with one-inch of water, over medium-high heat.<br />
Bring to boil and add 1-tablespoon salt.<br />
Reduce heat to medium and let simmer.</p>
<p>Stir several times during cooking. Cook for approximately 8-10 minutes, or until potatoes are tender.<br />
Drain and set aside.</p>
<p>While potatoes are cooking, whisk together yogurt, mayo, mustard, salt, pepper, and onion powder. Peel and cut hard-boiled eggs into small cubes.</p>
<p>Add the yogurt/mayo mixture to potatoes and stir slowly to combine.</p>
<p>Add the celery, pickles, red onions, parsley, and chopped eggs to the potato mixture, stir to combine.</p>
<p>Cover and refrigerate until chilled (at least 1 hour before serving)</p>

<p><strong>RECIPE 6: Low(er) Calorie Baked Beans</strong><br />
<strong>(Approx 10-12 servings)</strong></p>
<p>Baked beans are a cookout staple, but they are often soaked in ketchup and/or BBQ (remember what we said about condiments containing all kinds of hidden calories.) They also usually have fatty bacon and lots of brown sugar and/or molasses.</p>
<p>This recipe dials down the calories by subbing turkey bacon .. reduces sodium and sugar by using tomato sauce .. and further lightens the sugar-load by using stevia brown sugar!</p>
<p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>2 slices turkey bacon (chopped)</li>
<li>1 diced onion</li>
<li>15 ounce can navy beans , rinsed and drained</li>
<li>15 ounce can pinto beans , rinsed and drained</li>
<li>15 ounce can northern beans , rinsed and drained</li>
<li>1/2 cup tomato sauce</li>
<li>1 1/2 cups water</li>
<li>1 tsp Worcestershire sauce</li>
<li>1/4 tsp smoked​ paprika</li>
<li>1/2 cup stevia brown sugar</li>
<li>1 tablespoon yellow mustard</li>
<li>1 teaspoon chili powder</li>
<li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
<li>1/4 teaspoon black pepper</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Instructions:</strong><br />
In a large cooking pot &#8211; add bacon (with a little oil or spray oil) and cook on medium heat.<br />
Remove bacon once cooked.</p>
<p>Add onions to the pot and cook until translucent.</p>
<p>Add in beans, tomato sauce, water, dark brown sugar, yellow mustard, chili powder, salt and pepper, and stir.</p>
<p>Bring to a boil then reduce to a simmer. Cook for 45-60 minutes (until thick)</p>

<p><strong>SUGAR FREE JELLO SHOTS</strong><br />
it doesn&#8217;t get much easier than jell-o shots. You only need three ingredients: jell-o powder, hot water, and alcohol. We will dial down the calories and sugar by using SUGAR FREE JELLO!</p>
<p><strong>Instructions:</strong><br />
Pour all the Jell-O powder out of the box into the measuring cup, followed by 1 cup of boiling water. Whisk together until jell-o powder has completely dissolved into water.</p>
<p>Next, add your alcohol of choice. Just make sure your jell-o mixture is cool so that the alcohol doesn&#8217;t burn off.</p>
<p>Whiskin the alcohol and pour into some clear plastic cups!</p>
<p>Place in the refrigerator to firm up for 3 to 4 hours before serving.</p>

<p><strong>NON-ALCOHOLIC PATRIOTIC PUNCH</strong><br />
(Perfect following your patriotic pump workout.)</p>
<p>Ingredients:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://sculptnation.com/products/bcaas" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sculpt Nation Fruit Punch BCAAs</a> (prepared with water)</li>
<li>Blue Sports Drink (Zero calorie version)</li>
<li>Diet Sprite or 7-Up</li>
<li>Crushed ice</li>
<li>Regular ice cubes</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Instructions:</strong><br />
Fill up your cup all the way with ice cubes.<br />
Pour in your pre-made <a href="https://sculptnation.com/products/bcaas" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sculpt Nation BCAAs</a> (about ⅓ of the way)<br />
Add a few more ice cubes.<br />
Slowly pour a layer of blue Gatorade (about another ⅓ of the way up) directly over the ice cubes.<br />
Add crushed ice and slowly pour on the diet soda.</p>
<p>Using crushed ice should help keep the “colors” from mixing as much. It also gives the “white” to your red-white-blue drink theme!</p>

<p>If the idea of an Independence Day cookout has you feeling a little bit anxious about all the extra calories .. relax!!</p>
<p>It may seem like a diet disaster, but with a few adjustments, your cookout won’t set you back one bit!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Here are 5 Tips To Help You Grill Out GUILT FREE …</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>HEALTHY BBQ TIP #1: FIRE UP THE GRILL</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://sculptnation.com/products"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-7313" src="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_83769871.jpeg?resize=1170%2C834&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1170" height="834" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_83769871.jpeg?w=3052&amp;ssl=1 3052w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_83769871.jpeg?resize=300%2C214&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_83769871.jpeg?resize=768%2C547&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_83769871.jpeg?resize=1024%2C730&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_83769871.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w" sizes="(max-width: 1170px) 100vw, 1170px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>If your BBQ includes grilling .. you are in luck. This is one of the best ways to cook meat or make some veggies. You use much less (if any) oil on a grill, as opposed to sautéing or roasting. Grilling alone will really help lower your 4th of July calorie intake.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>HEALTHY BBQ TIP #2: PICK LEAN PROTEINS</strong></p>
<p><img class="size-large wp-image-7335" src="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_187212985.jpeg?resize=1024%2C661&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="661" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_187212985.jpeg?resize=1024%2C661&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_187212985.jpeg?resize=300%2C194&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_187212985.jpeg?resize=768%2C496&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_187212985.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_187212985.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>Hitting your protein goals on the 4th shouldn’t be a problem. You just need to be careful what cut of meat you choose.</p>
<p>A small burger patty or steak could easily set you back 25 grams of fat or more. Most hot dogs have a minimum of 14 grams of fat. Of course, that is before all the condiments and cheese.</p>
<p>You can still have a juicy, delicious burger, or hot dog, you just need to pick a leaner cut.</p>
<p>Examples of lean cuts of beef are … 96/4 or 90/10 ground sirloin, eye of round steak, sirloin tip steak, top round steak, bottom round steak, and top sirloin steak</p>
<p>For hot dogs .. there are a lot of low-fat or even fat-free franks on the market. You can also opt for a turkey or chicken hot dog. Just make sure you look at the nutrition label. People often think that turkey and chicken are automatically the most calorie-friendly choice. Sometimes they can be just as calorie filled as the original.</p>
<p>You can always skip the beef and go with other lean meats like chicken breast, white fish, shrimp, or even salmon.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>HEALTHY BBQ TIP #3: DITCH THE BUN &amp; CHOOSE CONDIMENTS WISELY</strong></p>
<p><img class="size-large wp-image-7330" src="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_266973608.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_266973608.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_266973608.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_266973608.jpeg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_266973608.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_266973608.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">What&#8217;s a burger or hot dog without a bun? Actually .. they can be just as delicious without all those extra carbs. A bun usually contains about 200 calories.</p>
<p>Why not save those calories for some delicious sides like potato salad? Or an adult beverage, like a watermelon tonic?</p>
<p>After all, the bun is really just a way for us to eat what’s inside. Your burger will be just as good eaten with a fork!</p>
<p>Save yourself some calories, and opt for a lettuce wrap or no bun at all. Or, check out this delicious bun recipe that is EASY to make and will only set you back a few carbs. You won&#8217;t miss the real bread, promise!!</p>
<p>To make your burger more filling, load it up with plenty of vegetables &#8211; like tomatoes, onions, mushrooms, lettuce, jalapenos, etc. But use caution with condiments.</p>
<p>BBQ sauce and mayonnaise can be calorie bombs. A couple tiny spoonfuls could set you back hundreds of calories. Believe it or not, even ketchup is pretty calorie-dense.</p>
<p>Mustard, salsa, horseradish, and hot sauce are great choices. There are some great low-sugar or lower calorie bbq and ketchup alternatives out there. Look for those when you do your 4th of July grocery haul!</p>

<p>The best way to avoid a bbq binge is to not go to your cookout hungry. Starving yourself all day could backfire .. causing you to overeat on higher calorie foods.</p>
<p>You don’t need to starve yourself all day and stock-pile calories. Especially if you are using any of our healthy recipes below.</p>
<p>You also don’t need to eat everything available. Prioritize lean protein and veggies and then scan the picnic table for what appeals to you <em><strong>the most</strong></em> and only have small portions of each of those things.</p>
<p>Eat plenty of protein leading up to the BBQ and drink lots of water. Protein shakes are a convenient and delicious way to do that .. and for a limited time we are giving you <strong>40% off your <a href="https://sculptnation.com/products" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sculpt Nation</a> order!</strong></p>

<p>You can also avoid overeating by eating slow and socializing! Food may be a big part of 4th of July festivities .. but it’s not the only reason we gather to celebrate.</p>
<p>If you find yourself still wanting more, step away from the food spread for a little while. Drink some water, or enjoy one of our low-calorie drinks below. Give yourself a little bit of time before you go back for seconds.</p>
<p>Another way you can keep your cravings in check and make sure your body is in a better fat burning mode (instead of fat storing mode) .. is to take a fat-burning thermogenic support supplement like <a href="https://sculptnation.com/products/burn" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>Sculpt Nation BURN.</strong></em></a></p>

<p>In addition to getting in your patriotic pump workout, look for other ways to add physical activity to your cookout. Go on walks and set up some fun outdoor games!</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>Eating healthy on Cinco de Mayo Is Easier Than You Think</strong></em></p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-7080 aligncenter" src="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/CDM-blog-01-fb-vs.gif?resize=600%2C600&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="600" height="600" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>It is time for the ultimate #TacoTuesday … Cinco de Mayo 2020 is upon us!</p>
<p>If you are on a diet (or just trying not to gain the “Quarantine 15”) … you may think that a fiesta of tacos, tortillas, and tequila is off-limits.</p>
<p>No doubt, many standard Mexican dishes are full of calories, which could easily result in a dieting disaster!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>But you don&#8217;t have to skip the Cinco de Mayo festivities.</strong></em></p>
<p>Without all of the oils, sauces, and cheese, most of the ingredients that make up your favorite Mexican dishes are very waistline-friendly.</p>
<ul>
<li>Lean Meat</li>
<li>Fiber-Rich Beans</li>
<li>Rice</li>
<li>Vegetables</li>
<li>Salsa</li>
<li>Avocado</li>
<li>Herbs and Spices (like cilantro, chile peppers, etc.)</li>
</ul>
<p>The base for most Mexican cuisine is very diet-friendly! Which makes modifying your Cinco de Mayo spread super easy!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>Grab your sombrero…</strong></em><br />
<em><strong>We’ve got a Cinco de Mayo menu that will allow you to</strong></em><br />
<em><strong>enjoy the festivities and stay on track!</strong></em></p>
<p>Before we give you TEN different macro-friendly recipes, here is a Cinco de Mayo FUN FACT for ya … in case you want to impress your fiesta crew!</p>
<p><em><strong>Did you know</strong></em>… Cinco de Mayo (Spanish for “5th of May”) is not a Mexican holiday?<br />
Many people confuse it with Mexican Independence Day (that isn’t until September.)</p>
<p>Cinco de Mayo is actually a day that commemorates the Battle of Puebla when the Mexican army had victory over France during the Franco-Mexican War.</p>
<p>Except for the city of Puebla, where they celebrate with a military parade and mock battle, Cinco celebrations are pretty low-key in Mexico.</p>
<p>Americans, however, use the day as an excuse to eat tacos, bottomless bowls of chips and salsa and pound pitchers of margaritas!</p>
<p>I mean, we aren’t complaining… any excuse for some tacos and tequila, right?</p>
<p>Enough history&#8230; let the fiesta begin!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>HEALTHY CINCO MAIN DISHES</strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>LOW CARB FISH TACO BOWL</strong></span><br />
This bowl reminds us of a sunny day at the beach! It is so flavorful that you won’t even miss the carb-filled tortilla! We are using white fish, but you can substitute grilled chicken, salmon, or shrimp!</p>

<p><a href="https://vshred.com/sp/survey/survey-aka1/"><img class="alignnone wp-image-7064 size-full" src="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_260621634.jpeg?resize=1170%2C780&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1170" height="780" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_260621634.jpeg?w=5760&amp;ssl=1 5760w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_260621634.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_260621634.jpeg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_260621634.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_260621634.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_260621634.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1170px) 100vw, 1170px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>There really isn’t a special recipe here (however we are gonna give you one for some inspo.)</p>
<p>All you do is think of what you love in and on a burrito .. and throw it in a bowl instead of wrapping it in a carb-heavy flour tortilla!</p>
<p>With all the flavors and volume, you won’t miss the carbs! Plus, skipping out on rice or a tortilla means you save calories for an extra Skinny Margarita instead (recipe for that is below.)</p>
<p>Get creative and use your favorite lean protein, veggies, and garnishes!<br />
Here is how we like to make our bowl ….</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Bowl Ingredients:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Lean meat of choice (grilled chicken, lean shredded pork, lean steak, fish, shrimp, etc.)</li>
<li>Lots of shredded lettuce</li>
<li>Steamed cilantro lime rice, cauliflower rice, or quinoa.</li>
<li>Sauteed Fajita Veggies</li>
<li>Fajita Seasoning</li>
<li>Black Beans</li>
<li>Corn</li>
<li>Salsa</li>
<li>Pico</li>
<li>Guac</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Bowl Instructions:</span></p>
<p>Make your meat however you choose using seasonings that compliment Mexican fare!<br />
We are using a lean sirloin steak rubbed with a cilantro lime seasoning.</p>
<p>Make your steamed rice, cauli rice, or quinoa (add lime, cilantro, and salt for extra flavor.)</p>
<p>Sautee Veggies (we are using olive oil cooking spray, peppers, onions, and mushrooms)</p>
<p>Crack open a can of corn and black beans and heat them up on the stove or microwave.</p>
<p>Put a ton of shredded lettuce in a big bowl. Mix in some salsa, lime juice, and seasoning to give your lettuce a little extra flavor. Pile in all your ingredients. Mix up. Top with garnishes of choice…. dig in!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>SOUTHWEST CHICKEN QUESADILLAS</strong></span><br />
Typically we would tell you that a quesadilla should be a hard pass. At a restaurant, this carb-heavy menu staple is fried in oil and filled with hundreds of calories of cheese, with very little (and sometimes no) protein and veggies. But it is easy to give this typically high-calorie Mexican staple a healthy upgrade at home!</p>

<p>One of the quickest ways to eat a TON of calories in no time&#8230; is with chips and dips!</p>
<p>For “chips” … there are lots of baked versions you can purchase. But if you want to make your own tortilla chips, it is super simple!</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Tortilla Chip Ingredients:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Corn tortillas</li>
<li>Olive or Avocado Oil Spray (or a tiny bit of the actual oil)</li>
<li>Salt</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Tortilla Chip Instructions:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Heat oven to 350 degrees.</li>
<li>Cut corn tortillas into triangles.</li>
<li>Spray or lightly brush with oil.</li>
<li>Sprinkle on some salt.</li>
<li>Place on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper and bake about 10 minutes, or until crispy!</li>
</ul>
<p><em><strong>If you want to save some carbs, a great alternative to chips would be fresh veggies, like peppers, celery, and zucchini!</strong></em></p>
<p>For “dips”… salsa is always a safe choice, especially if you make your own at home.</p>
<p>Guacamole is another popular choice. While guac is made with healthy avocados, it is easy to overeat this delicious chip dipper!</p>
<p>But with a simple recipe trick, you can easily add “bulk” to your guacamole so you can<br />
enjoy more&#8230; for less!</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Skinny Guacamole Ingredients:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>1 large ripe avocado</li>
<li>1/4 cup coarsely chopped fresh cilantro</li>
<li>1/4 cup finely chopped onion</li>
<li>2 cloves garlic</li>
<li>2 tablespoons lime juice</li>
<li>1/2 teaspoon hot sauce</li>
<li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
<li>1 large zucchini cut into chunks OR 1 cup steamed peas</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Skinny Guacamole Instructions:</span></p>
<p>(zucchini version)</p>
<ul>
<li>Place the chopped zucchini in a microwave-safe bowl and cover with a damp paper towel. Microwave on high until tender (3-5 minutes.)</li>
<li>Drain any liquid by pressing lightly on the zucchini.</li>
<li>Let cool for about 5 minutes.</li>
<li>Add avocado, cilantro, onion, garlic, lime juice, hot sauce, and salt. Mash with a fork until combined.</li>
</ul>
<p>(pea version) *using peas will make the guac slightly sweeter*</p>
<ul>
<li>Lightly steam peas. Allow to cool and then mash by hand or place in a food processor and pulse until the peas are smooth.</li>
<li>Transfer peas into a large bowl and add the rest of the guacamole ingredients above, minus the zucchini (Adding both could work too. More veggies is never a bad thing.)</li>
<li>Mix well, mashing the avocado as you stir.</li>
</ul>

<p>Also known as Elote, this delicious corn dish was given the nickname “Mexican Street Corn” because it is a staple for street vendors in Mexico.</p>
<p>You can get fancy and make/serve it on a stick like they do .. or skip the stick .. and place it straight on the grill. If you don’t have a grill, you can also make the corn in the oven.<br />
Can’t find corn on the cob? Use canned or frozen corn, mix in the other ingredients, and serve it off the cob!</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Ingredients:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>4 medium corn on the cob (husked and silk removed)</li>
<li>¼ cup light or fat free mayonnaise</li>
<li>¼ cup fresh chopped cilantro</li>
<li>2 tbsp plain fat free greek yogurt</li>
<li>1 tsp fresh lime juice</li>
<li>1 tsp</li>
<li>½ tsp ancho chile powder</li>
<li>¼ tsp minced garlic</li>
<li>4 Tbsp cotija cheese (Can sub crumbled fat free feta for an even healthier version, see notes)</li>
<li>Olive oil cooking spray</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Instructions</span></p>
<ol>
<li>Preheat grill to medium.</li>
<li>Lightly spray corn with cooking spray.</li>
<li>Place corn on the grill, turning occasionally.</li>
<li>Cook until tender and slightly charred (10-15 minutes.)</li>
<li>While the corn is on the grill, combine all ingredients except the cheese in a small bowl.</li>
<li>When corn is ready, brush with the mixture and then sprinkle each ear with 1 Tbsp cheese. Add a few more shakes of chili powder for an extra kick!</li>
</ol>
<p>*While they both have a similar texture and mild salty flavor, feta cheese will not taste the same as cotija. Because feta is easy to find and comes in a fat free variety, it is a decent substitute that could serve as a lower-calorie option. Grated parmesan cheese could also be a substitute.</p>

<p>Mexican sangria is a traditional Spanish beverage that combines wine, fruit, sugar, and some spices. It is known to have a slightly higher alcohol content than Spanish sangria and pairs well with spicy foods!</p>
<p>We are gonna go a MUCH healthier route with a sangria “mocktail” that contains <a href="https://sculptnation.com/products/bcaas" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BCAAs</a>, making it a perfect post-workout treat! Because we know you are gonna get in a sweat session before your fiesta, right?</p>
<p>Ingredients:<br />
1 scoop <a href="https://sculptnation.com/products/bcaas" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sculpt Nation Fruit Punch BCAAs</a><br />
1 cup fruit of choice (examples: sliced blood oranges, sliced peaches, raspberries, strawberries, blueberries, etc. We love the combo of oranges, peaches, and strawberries.)<br />
4 oz diet ginger ale<br />
8 oz water</p>
<p>Instructions:<br />
Add water, a scoop of <a href="https://sculptnation.com/products/bcaas" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sculpt Nation BCAAs</a>, fruit, and ginger ale (in this order) to a shaker cup. Shake up and serve chilled!</p>
<p><em><strong>Why BCAAs?</strong></em><br />
For starters, they are delicious and add flavor to your drink for no added calories (you can’t say the same with typical fruit juices or sangria mixes.)</p>
<p>But they can also provide tons of recovery benefits! So if you take us up on our Cinco Tips (below) and get in a good training session before your fiesta… <em><strong>this Sangria recipe would be a great post-workout drink!</strong></em></p>
<p><a href="https://sculptnation.com/products/bcaas" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BCAAs</a> (or branched-chain amino acids) assist in helping you recover from your training sessions much faster. They provide exactly what your body needs to support getting into an anabolic state (muscle building and fat burning) &#8211; and help repair the damage training causes to your muscle fibers. <em><strong>Quicker recovery means&#8230; less muscle soreness!</strong></em></p>
<p>Faster recovery is only one perk of supplementing with <a href="https://sculptnation.com/products/bcaas" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">quality BCAAs</a>. The essential amino acids in our <a href="https://sculptnation.com/products/bcaas" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sculpt Nation blend</a> have been shown to assist with and support&#8230;</p>

<li>3 tablespoons fresh lemon juice</li>
<li>1 cup ice cubes</li>

</ul>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Instructions:</span></p>

<li>Serve and sip!</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>If none of these recipes entice your taste buds… there are plenty of healthy swaps you can make that will allow you to stick to your diet…</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>Here are some tips!</strong></em></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>ENJOY</strong></span><br />
<strong>Fresh Veggies</strong>: No limit here! Veggies are a great way to add “bulk” to your Cinco dishes. Just don’t cook them in a ton of oil. Steam or saute with cooking spray!</p>
<p><strong>Lean Meats</strong>: grilled chicken, white fish, shrimp, and even lean shredded pork loin! Load up on lean protein.</p>
<p><strong>Salsa</strong>: This condiment adds tons of flavor to your food and is very low in calories and carbs.<br />
If you are watching sodium, many store-bought salsas are super high in sodium! You can always make you own!</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">LIMIT</span></strong><br />
<strong>Tortillas</strong>: Opt for “thin” or mini street size tortillas. Another option is to mix things up. Have 1-2 tortillas, and for the rest of your tacos, use a lettuce wrap instead!</p>
<p><strong>Rice</strong>: Nothing wrong with rice! Just be mindful. This small grain can add up to some significant carbs! Also, pass on rice cooked in oil and use steamed rice flavored with things like lime juice and cilantro! If you want to add bulk to your rice, do a 50/50 mix of rice and cauli rice!</p>
<p><strong>Guacamole</strong>: Avocados are very healthy! But it can be easy to eat a full day’s worth of fat in one sitting of chips &amp; guac if you aren&#8217;t careful! Remember that even “healthy” foods have calories! If you want more “bulk,” try our lower fat guac recipe above.</p>
<p><strong>Fruit Based Salsa</strong>: This is another example of how healthy foods still have calories. There is nothing wrong with fruit, but keep in mind fruit based salsas do have more carbs.</p>
<p><strong>Low-Fat Cheese</strong>: The same rule applies here! Just be mindful! A sprinkle can go a long way in adding flavor to your dishes!</p>
<p><strong>Beans</strong>: This is another super healthy food that we encourage you to add to your dishes! Just keep in mind that beans do have a decent amount of both protein and fat and not ALL beans are healthy (skip the refried.)</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>PASS</strong></span><br />
<strong>Full Fat Cheese</strong>: Things like queso dip, etc.</p>
<p><strong>Anything Fried</strong>: Eat black beans instead of refried beans. Baked chips instead of fried chips. Soft flour or corn tortillas instead of crispy taco shells.</p>
<p><strong>Fattier Cuts Of Meat</strong>: Many Mexican restaurants use fatty cuts of beef, chicken thighs instead of breast, and pork shoulder instead of a leaner loin. Make sure you are using lean cuts of meat for your dishes.</p>
<p><strong>Sugary Pre-Mixed Drinks</strong>: Of course, alcohol has calories, but so do the sugary mixes you use to make your favorite margarita! Skip the pre-made mixes, or things like triple sec, and make your own using our recipe above. You should use caution with alcohol in general. It’s not just the “empty” calories in the drinks themselves, it’s also the temptation to make bad decisions after a few drinks kick in!</p>
<p><strong>OTHER TIPS</strong><br />
If you are going to support your local Mexican restaurant, when you order, you can make a few special requests to make your meal healthier!</p>
<p>Ask them to steam your vegetables, use light or no oil when cooking, pass on the cheese and refried beans, get ALL sauces on the side and use them in moderation, ask for lettuce wraps instead of tortillas, skip their rice (unless it’s steamed) and add your own at home, and instead of having them include their fried tortilla chips .. make your own using our recipe above.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Healthy or Modified…</em></strong><br />
<em>Make sure you put those calories to good use and get in a pre-Cinco lift!!</em><br />
<em>If you need some ideas, we have hundreds (for free) on our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/vshred" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">YouTube channel</a>!</em></p>
<p>If you decide to indulge and eat some non-modified fiesta foods, here are a few more ways you can lessen the “damage” from all the extra calories you consume!</p>
<ul>
<li>Plan your fiesta to be a “High Carb Day” &#8211; “Free Meal” &#8211; “ReFeed Day” &#8211; etc.</li>
<li>Plan your training split so that you work one of your lagging/larger body parts and get in a solid lift and cardio session before you indulge!</li>
<li>Go on a pre and post-meal walk to increase your daily <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12468415" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NEAT</a>.</li>
<li>Include a fat-burning thermogenic support supplement like <a href="https://sculptnation.com/products/burn">Sculpt Nation BURN</a> that helps naturally suppress appetite!</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://sculptnation.com/products/burn" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BURN</a> is different from many “fat burners” on the market. It’s so unique, we don’t even like to call it that. Most fat burners may help you burn a few extra calories, but it ends there. Any fat that is mobilized may still be in your blood waiting for a new place to live (like your stomach or thighs.)</p>
<p><a href="https://sculptnation.com/products/burn" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BURN</a> goes further .. it attacks your body fat from three essential pathways.. blasting fat cells from the inside out.</p>
<p>Even if you are choosing to lighten up your fiesta, <a href="https://sculptnation.com/products/burn" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BURN</a> is a great addition to your supplement stack because it goes beyond helping you burn calories. It helps support and raise your metabolic rate! Increasing your metabolic rate helps boost your body’s ability to burn fat for fuel!</p>

<p>When you think about your genetics …. what comes to mind?</p>
<p>Probably traits passed down from your parents .. like your eye and hair color, the shape of your nose, maybe even your hot temper, and of course, the shape of your body.</p>
<p>You have probably heard someone say something similar to this (and possibly even said it yourself) &#8230;<em><strong>“Everyone in my family is overweight. It doesn’t matter what I do, it’s my genetics.”</strong></em></p>
<p>Yes, genetics can determine where you store fat, how much muscle you can pack on, how wide your hips are, and even how your body responds to certain foods. We even preach the importance of <a href="https://vshred.com/sp/survey/survey-aka1/">training and eating for your specific body type</a> because <em><strong>our FIXED genes can influence many aspects of who we are</strong></em>.</p>
<p>We can’t control the genes we’ve been given. But when it comes to how well you can drop body fat… <em><strong>the finger may need to be pointed at a second set of genes you didn’t get from your parents.</strong></em></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-6899 size-full" src="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/AdobeStock_216416516.jpeg?resize=1170%2C741&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1170" height="741" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/AdobeStock_216416516.jpeg?w=5760&amp;ssl=1 5760w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/AdobeStock_216416516.jpeg?resize=300%2C190&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/AdobeStock_216416516.jpeg?resize=768%2C486&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/AdobeStock_216416516.jpeg?resize=1024%2C649&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/AdobeStock_216416516.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/AdobeStock_216416516.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1170px) 100vw, 1170px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><strong>The Second Genome</strong><br />
There are over 37 trillion “human” cells in our bodies that contain our DNA, and <em><strong>the majority of these cells ARE NOT hereditary genes.</strong></em></p>
<p>It’s a “second set of genes” that researchers call our second genome. Unlike your inherited genes, which are more or less fixed, this second set of genes is not.</p>
<p>57% of the cells that make YOU who YOU ARE and live in your body are not passed down by your parents.</p>
<p><em><strong>THIS IS GOOD NEWS</strong></em> … we will tell you why and how you can reverse this a little further down in this article.</p>
<p>First, let’s explain what this “second genome” is.</p>
<p>This second set of genes is a bunch of bacteria, fungi, parasites, and viruses! That’s right, you are mostly made up of a bunch of .. well .. bugs.</p>
<p>These microscopic organisms (<strong>called MICROBIOME</strong>) play a vital role in supporting the daily operation of your body.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-6900 size-full" src="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/AdobeStock_152941653.jpeg?resize=1170%2C941&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1170" height="941" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/AdobeStock_152941653.jpeg?w=7000&amp;ssl=1 7000w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/AdobeStock_152941653.jpeg?resize=300%2C241&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/AdobeStock_152941653.jpeg?resize=768%2C618&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/AdobeStock_152941653.jpeg?resize=1024%2C824&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/AdobeStock_152941653.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/AdobeStock_152941653.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1170px) 100vw, 1170px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>You name it&#8230; your microbiome helps it function.</p>
<ul>
<li>Food Digestion</li>
<li>Nutrient Absorption</li>
<li>Energy Production</li>
<li>Immune System Regulation (⅔ of our immune system resides in the gut)</li>
<li>Skin Health</li>
<li>Mental Health/Brain Function</li>
<li>++ MORE</li>
</ul>
<p>These microbes live everywhere in your body! Bacteria is the most common organism, and the vast majority takes residency in your gut.</p>
<p>A healthy adult will have about FIVE POUNDS of bacteria in their colon. Some are BENEFICIAL… others are HARMFUL!</p>
<p>If you have too much unfriendly bacteria, that is when you may start to have<br />
adverse effects such as&#8230;</p>
<ul>
<li>GI Discomfort (occasional bloating, constipation, diarrhea, indigestion)</li>
<li>Fatigue</li>
<li>Brian Fog</li>
<li>Difficulty Losing Weight</li>
<li>A Sluggish Immune System</li>
<li>Nutrition Deficiency</li>
<li>Unrestful Sleep</li>
<li>++ MORE</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>Here is THE GOOD NEWS &#8230;</strong></em></p>
<p>The organisms live in you today may not be the same as the ones that colonize next week. They are constantly changing and have been since the day you were born.</p>
<p>This means you have the ability to impact what could be holding you back from reaching your fitness goals AND feeling your best mentally and physically.</p>
<p>But this can only happen if you take <em><strong>a very specific and proactive approach</strong></em> to ensure you are swapping out that “bad” bacteria with good bacteria .. or at least maintaining a proper balance of the two.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>You need to reach something called “Microbial Harmony.”</strong></em></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-6901 size-full" src="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/AdobeStock_292486431.jpeg?resize=1170%2C781&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1170" height="781" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/AdobeStock_292486431.jpeg?w=6004&amp;ssl=1 6004w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/AdobeStock_292486431.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/AdobeStock_292486431.jpeg?resize=768%2C513&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/AdobeStock_292486431.jpeg?resize=1024%2C684&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/AdobeStock_292486431.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/AdobeStock_292486431.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1170px) 100vw, 1170px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><strong>What Is Microbial Harmony?</strong><br />
We all have our own “Microbiome Blueprint” that is as unique as your fingerprint … nobody else has YOUR exact microbiome. Even identical twins are made up of a totally different accumulation of microbial life.</p>
<p>Researchers have also found that the organisms that live in people of a healthy weight are VERY DIFFERENT than those that are overweight. This strongly suggests&#8230; <em><strong>having a healthy balance of bacteria likely play a crucial role in our ability to lose weight.</strong></em></p>
<p>The reason our microbiome is so individual (and continually changing) is most likely a result of our personal lifestyle practices as well as our interactions with the world around us.</p>
<ul>
<li>Eating too many processed foods</li>
<li>Lack of micro-nutrient diversity</li>
<li>Not exercising</li>
<li>Environmental toxins (in the air you breathe, the water you drink and bathe in, foods you consume, surfaces you touch, pollution, etc.)</li>
<li>Stress</li>
<li>Age</li>
</ul>
<p>As you see… some of these things you do have total control over… others, not so much!</p>
<p>If you are serious about wanting to get in the best shape of your life and feel even better than you look… <em><strong>you need to take GUT HEALTH seriously.</strong></em></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Action Step #1</strong></span><br />
STOP being so quick to “blame” your genetics for every setback and issue with your health and take responsibility for what you are (or aren’t) doing to contribute.<br />
Unlike the genes your ancestors gave you, many of your issues could be tied to your second genome, and reversing that is somewhat in your control!</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Action Step #2</strong></span><br />
Remove (or add) the things you have control over. Things such as .. lowering your stress levels, getting enough sleep, eliminating or reducing processed foods, and exercising regularly.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Action Step #3</strong></span><br />
This step is the most important and something you have COMPLETE control over.<br />
You have to replenish your healthy bacteria. To do this, you have to feed your gut healthy bacteria.</p>
<p>There are two ways you can go about this&#8230;.</p>
<p>You could attempt to incorporate very specific high quality prebiotic and probiotic foods that are rich in healthy bacteria.</p>
<p>This would include consistently consuming LARGE amounts of things like…</p>
<ul>
<li>Yogurt</li>
<li>Kefir</li>
<li>Kimchi or Sauerkraut</li>
<li>Raw/Organic Fruits &amp; Vegetables</li>
<li>Specific Nuts and Beans</li>
<li>Seeds (such as chia and flax)</li>
<li>++ MORE</li>
</ul>
<p>Most people would never be able to eat this type of variety every single day.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>Or&#8230; you could go the much easier and better route!</strong></em></p>
<p>Our product formulation team at Sculpt Nation studied HUNDREDS of gut-beneficial strains of bacteria and narrowed it down to 7 KEY STRAINS that you need daily to achieve Microbial Harmony.</p>
<p>These strains deliver over 3.8 BILLION colony-forming units of microbiome-boosting bacteria that will get your gut in a balanced “harmonized” state.</p>
<p>Our researchers also discovered that this bacteria has to have a very type of specific FOOD to survive and thrive!</p>
<p>It took our team over 18 months to get this formula right, and we are FINALLY ready and eager to pass it on to you!</p>

<p><em><strong>THE TRUTH IS…..</strong></em><br />
Most of us are in a state of “Microbial Chaos” that puts your body in a position that makes it IMPOSSIBLE to look, feel, and function at your best.</p>
<p><em><strong>YOU ARE NOT STUCK!</strong> </em><br />
What makes YOU (you) .. is more than the DNA passed down from your bloodline! We simply overlook the fact that our microbiome has a KEY role in so many of our body (and brain) functions.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>Experts say that we have more bacteria in our guts than we do cells in our entire body!</strong></em><br />

<p><em><strong>Will You Win Or Lose This Super Bowl Sunday?</strong></em></p>
<p>As the 49ers and Chiefs battle it out on the field, many of you will face your own game day battle&#8230; and we’ve got your defensive strategy!</p>
<p>You made it past the new year’s resolution hump <em>(the point when most people have already failed)</em> and are smashing your goals.</p>
<p><strong>Then… FOUL!!</strong></p>
<p>You are faced with an (unofficial) American holiday that is celebrated with lots of food.</p>
<p>Super Bowl Sunday is the second biggest food consumption day of the year! The only day that scores more calories is Thanksgiving.</p>
<p><strong>Here is what goes down in a matter of only a few hours&#8230;</strong></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-6687 size-large" src="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/AdobeStock_317072671-1.jpeg?resize=1024%2C672&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="672" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/AdobeStock_317072671-1.jpeg?resize=1024%2C672&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/AdobeStock_317072671-1.jpeg?resize=300%2C197&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/AdobeStock_317072671-1.jpeg?resize=768%2C504&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/AdobeStock_317072671-1.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/AdobeStock_317072671-1.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<ul>
<li>1.3 Billion Chicken Wings</li>
<li>2 Million Pizzas</li>
<li>10 Million Pounds of Ribs</li>
<li>88 Million Pounds of Cheese</li>
<li>9200 Tons of Chips</li>
<li>3 Million Pounds of Nuts</li>
<li>325.5 Million Gallons of Beer</li>
</ul>
<p>And that’s just a breakdown of the most popular Super Bowl foods!</p>
<p>So yeah, it’s safe to say that a calorie surplus is in the playbook for many Americans.</p>
<p>While we always preach that <em>“one meal”</em> or even <em>“one day”</em> of eating off your diet plan won’t hurt your overall progress, we’ll let you do the math on how this one day could be an exception.</p>
<p><em><strong>If we know that&#8230;</strong></em></p>
<p>A SURPLUS of 3,500 calories = 1 pound of weight gain.</p>
<p><em><strong>And it is estimated that…</strong></em></p>
<p>The average calories a person will consume on Super Bowl Sunday is 6,000!</p>
<p>It’s easy to see how scrambling back and forth to the buffet table could indeed result in a major poundage penalty, and we want to make sure you are ready to tackle the day!</p>
<p>It may seem like you can’t win unless you sit this one out on the sidelines, but being focused on losing weight does not mean you have to lose out on all the fun, or food!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>FOOLPROOF SUPER BOWL STRATEGY</strong></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-6675 size-large" src="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/superbowl-vince-01.png?resize=1024%2C1024&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="1024" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/superbowl-vince-01.png?resize=1024%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/superbowl-vince-01.png?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 150w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/superbowl-vince-01.png?resize=300%2C300&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/superbowl-vince-01.png?resize=768%2C768&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/superbowl-vince-01.png?resize=60%2C60&amp;ssl=1 60w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/superbowl-vince-01.png?w=1080&amp;ssl=1 1080w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>First… PICK A TEAM</strong><br />
When game day arrives, you should have a plan that starts with deciding which team you are going to be on.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Team <em>“Live-A-Little”</em> VS. Team <em>“Stick-To-The-Plan”</em></strong></p>
<p>We are placing our bets on&#8230;<strong> TEAM LIVE A LITTLE!</strong><br />
That’s because the odds are against you if you tell yourself you aren’t <em>“allowed”</em> to eat something. It is better to go slightly off your plan and practice mindfulness.</p>
<p>Sure, there is the risk that once you get a<em> “taste,”</em> you won’t be able to stop eating, but you have to learn to have willpower at some point. Let’s start mastering that right now!</p>
<p>Your goal is to walk in with a winning attitude.</p>
<p>You can’t let yourself feel ANY guilt about your decision to live a little. Next, you have to trust yourself to be disciplined enough to use mindfulness and moderation to avoid going overboard.</p>
<p><strong>Next… Your Pre-game plan.</strong></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-6719" src="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/superbowl-pregame-blog.png?resize=1024%2C1024&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="1024" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/superbowl-pregame-blog.png?resize=1024%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/superbowl-pregame-blog.png?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 150w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/superbowl-pregame-blog.png?resize=300%2C300&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/superbowl-pregame-blog.png?resize=768%2C768&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/superbowl-pregame-blog.png?resize=60%2C60&amp;ssl=1 60w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/superbowl-pregame-blog.png?w=1080&amp;ssl=1 1080w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><strong>Prepare A Healthy Dish</strong><br />
If you are hosting a party, then you have complete control and can modify almost every snack to be healthy or healthier! If you are attending a party, ask if you can bring something.</p>
<p><strong>Get In Your Workout</strong><br />
Get in your sweat session before the big game. If you tell yourself you’ll do it afterward; you are no doubt setting yourself up to lose!</p>
<p>Add a quick HIIT cardio session on to the end of your lift, like this one, and you will have the perks of that <em>“after-burn effect”</em> that continues well past the final Super Bowl buzzer!</p>
<p><strong>Do Not Calorie Hoard</strong><br />
While it may be tempting to save all your calories or starve yourself in preparation for a food surplus, that is overall a bad idea. Going to the party hungry will NO DOUBT lead to over-eating. At the same time, there is nothing wrong with saving some calories and being mindful in the hours leading up to the big game.</p>
<p>You can do this by having lower carb/fat meals and sticking with mainly lean proteins beforehand. Make sure you have a meal right before the festivities. Fill up a shaker with a <a href="https://sculptnation.com/products/protein">Sculpt Nation Protein</a> smoothie and drink up on your way there!</p>
<p><strong>Get A Good Night Of Sleep</strong><br />
Sleep deprivation not only gets your hormones out of whack, but grogginess also leads to bad decisions, such as overeating! Aim for 7-9 hours of shut-eye the night before the game!</p>
<p>If you need some help falling and staying asleep, you may want to look into a natural remedy, like <a href="https://sculptnation.com/products/burn-pm">Sculpt Nation BURN PM</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Supplement</strong><br />
You can get a head-start before those cravings ever kick in by adding in an appetite suppressant like <a href="https://sculptnation.com/products/burn">Sculpt Nation BURN.</a></p>
<p>You can grab the supplements mentioned above for <strong>30% OFF</strong> now through Superbowl Sunday when you use <strong>code: SUPER30</strong> at checkout! <a href="https://sculptnation.com/products">Click Here to shop.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://sculptnation.com/products"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-6676 size-full" src="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/1-Superbowl-Blog-giphy.gif?resize=480%2C480&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="480" height="480" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Now It’s Time For KICK-OFF… Implement This 5 Step Defensive Strategy</strong></p>
<p><strong>Survey the spread</strong><br />
Take a look at all your options. Think about what is in each dish, what may be the healthiest option and the most filling. Take a moment to ask yourself what you are really craving. Just because it is on the table doesn’t mean it has to make its way to your plate!</p>
<p><strong>Dive in with mindfulness and moderation</strong><br />
Let’s start with beverages. Drink LOTS of water and unless you can’t fathom game day without a beer or two, pass on empty calories found in alcoholic beverages. If you must have alcohol, opt for a light beer, or liquor paired with calorie-free mixers.</p>
<p>When it comes to food, fill the majority of your plate with lots of veggies and any proteins that aren’t battered, fried, or cheese covered. Then when it comes to the good stuff, skip anything that you aren’t DYING to have and include small portions of only the things you REALLY want.</p>
<p><strong>Avoid “BLT’S”</strong><br />
We aren’t talking about the sandwich. We are talking about those little bites, licks, and tastes. A handful of chips as you pass by the bowl, just one more piece of pizza, only a small taste of that buffalo dip, and sneaking a cube of cheese every time you pass by, could easily ALL ADD UP to a full day worth of calories (or more.)</p>
<p>One way to avoid “grazing” is after you make your plate, instead of eating everything all at once, nibble off of the plate you made for yourself. Once it’s empty .. that’s it, no more!</p>
<p><strong>Stay away from the buffet</strong><br />
The problem with parties is that the food stays out for hours! It’s always there waiting for you to have a BLT! Avoidance is the best strategy. After you fill your plate walk away and DO NOT RETURN!</p>
<p>Drink water, chew gum, stay occupied! Whatever you do, don’t head back into that penalty zone! Remember to graze off your plate, not the food spread!</p>
<p><strong>Actually watch the game</strong><br />
And the commercials..and the half-time show…Remember WHY you are surrounded by all that food to begin. Get into the game, jump up and down, and cheer on your team.</p>
<p>If you aren’t into sports but are going to a party anyway, find other ways to stay busy by keeping the conversation going with friends or even ask someone to take it outside for some yard games or a walk around the block. If you are busy socializing, you won’t be thinking about casually making your way back to the buffet!</p>
<p><em><strong>THE GAME IS OVER … Do Not Penalize Yourself</strong></em></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-6722" src="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/superbowl-game-over.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/superbowl-game-over.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/superbowl-game-over.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/superbowl-game-over.jpeg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/superbowl-game-over.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/superbowl-game-over.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /><br />
Even if your team wins, if you lost your food battle, you will most likely wake up on Monday with a flood of negative thoughts.</p>
<p>This is <strong>NEVER</strong> a good place to be!</p>
<p>Feelings of guilt can cause you to do some crazy things, like give up altogether, or think you have no chance at bouncing back.</p>
<p>DO NOT let these thoughts cause you to give up! Let’s use one of the biggest Super Bowl blunders of all time as an example.</p>
<p>At Super Bowl XXXVII, just as the game was coming to an end, the Panthers managed to tie the score. But then John Kasey booted the kickoff out of bounds, giving the Patriots the ball at their own 40-yard line, allowing Tom Brady to step in and win the game!</p>
<p>Do you think Kasey called it quits and retired because of one bad plan? NO!! He went on to play seven more seasons with the Panthers.</p>
<p>Whatever choices you made, do not replay your game-day decisions. You consumed it… MOVE ON!</p>
<p>And by move on, we DO NOT mean that you should attempt any kind of “damage control.” You can not and should not try to restrict calories or attempt to punish yourself in an attempt to “work off” the calories you consumed.</p>
<p>I mean, come on, what are you gonna do? Run 60 miles?? That is more than two back-to-back marathons, yet that is what it would take to even <em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">potentially</span></em> “burn” six thousand extra calories!</p>
<p>Don’t let your mind go there! It’s not healthy, and the outcome will BACKFIRE!</p>
<p>Even if you attempt to “work off” the calories consumed, all you will really do is stress out your body. This could wreak havoc on your hormones and hinder your body&#8217;s ability to recover properly. These things can actually stall weight-loss or even cause weight gain!</p>
<p>The best plan of action is to just <strong>GET BACK ON TRACK</strong>!</p>
<p>A great way to get back on track fast is with the help of Sculpt Nation’s fat-melting, muscle building supplements.</p>

<p>‘Tis the season … that many people freak out about all the calories they are about to consume.</p>
<p>Understandably so! Temptations are everywhere this time of year!</p>
<ul>
<li>Your workplace probably has a new cookie delivery every day in December.</li>
<li>Your calendar is likely full of parties where high-calorie adult beverages and appetizers will be freely passed around.</li>
<li>You have at least one family feast to attend, if not several, all in one or two days.</li>
<li>You may be traveling with limited access to everything you (think) you need to stay on track with training.</li>
</ul>
<p>BUT .. you have a choice in how you approach the holidays.</p>
<p>You can CHOOSE to relax and enjoy yourself.<br />
<strong>OR</strong><br />
You can CHOOSE to be scared, stressed, and anxiety-filled.</p>
<p>All the things that make “dieting” hard, to begin with, will only be multiplied this month.<br />
But with a little planning and the right attitude, the holiday season is NOTHING to worry about.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong>8 Easy Tips For a Guilt-Free Holiday</strong></h3>
<p><strong>DO NOT STARVE YOURSELF&#8230;</strong><br />
If you go to a party or sit down at the holiday dinner table extremely hungry, you will no doubt overeat. Be mindful of what you eat leading into your holiday feast, but don’t go in starving. Unless you already incorporate dieting techniques such as Intermittent Fasting, if you are hungry before your feast, we do not suggest you skip meals.</p>
<p>Fill up on lean proteins and veggies, or enjoy a delicious <a href="https://sculptnation.com/product/protein/">Sculpt Nation protein shake using our top of the line Whey Protein Isolate!</a></p>
<p><a href="https://sculptnation.com/product/protein/"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-6613 size-large" src="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/PROTEIN-BLOG-FINAL.gif?resize=576%2C1024&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="576" height="1024" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/PROTEIN-BLOG-FINAL.gif?resize=576%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 576w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/PROTEIN-BLOG-FINAL.gif?resize=169%2C300&amp;ssl=1 169w" sizes="(max-width: 576px) 100vw, 576px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><strong>CHOOSE WISELY…</strong><br />
Just because it’s available does not mean you have to eat it. You should prioritize your favorite foods and only eat what you enjoy.</p>
<p>If you don’t love cranberry sauce, why eat it?<br />
If you have been craving your grandma’s stuffing all year, eat more of that!<br />
If you aren’t a big drinker, pass on the egg nog and have yourself a bigger slice of pie!<br />
Pile up on protein, but maybe go light on the gravy.</p>
<p>Also, remember that your eyes tend to be bigger than your stomach. Sometimes simply seeing or smelling all that delicious food will increase your appetite. <a href="https://sculptnation.com/product/burn-fat-burner/">Sculpt Nation BURN</a> would be a great product to implement. BURN is a cutting edge fat burner that contains a powerful appetite suppressant that can help hold back the desire to overfill your plate.</p>
<p><a href="https://sculptnation.com/product/burn-fat-burner/"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-6612 size-large" src="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/BURN-GIF-FINAL.gif?resize=576%2C1024&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="576" height="1024" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/BURN-GIF-FINAL.gif?resize=576%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 576w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/BURN-GIF-FINAL.gif?resize=169%2C300&amp;ssl=1 169w" sizes="(max-width: 576px) 100vw, 576px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><strong>BE MINDFUL…</strong><br />
When it’s time to dig in, start with smaller portions, and then eat slowly. If you think you want to go back for seconds <em>(or thirds)</em>, give yourself a break before filling your plate again.</p>
<p>Your hands are a great measuring tool if you want to ensure you don’t go overboard.</p>
<p><strong>Your clenched fist is about a cup…</strong> This measure is useful for side dishes.</p>
<p><strong>The palm of your hand is about 3 ounces of cooked meat…</strong> Use this as a guide for all that turkey and ham.</p>
<p><strong>Your thumb = about 1 tablespoon….</strong> This measure comes in handy when you’re trying to estimate things like dressings and gravy.</p>
<p><strong>MODIFY…</strong><br />
We are NOT suggesting that you ask your wife, mom, or grandma to change their family recipe. But there is nothing wrong with modifying the dish that you contribute.<br />
There are endless ways to make all your holiday favorites into lower-calorie options, especially for breakfast! Why not serve up some <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/pumpkin-spice-protein/">Sculpt Nation Protein Pancakes</a> instead of a high-calorie Christmas morning feast. With a little creativity, modifications are endless!</p>
<p><strong>JUST MOVE…</strong><br />
You may not be able to get in your usual lifts and cardio, but that doesn’t mean you can’t get in a good workout. At the very least, you can always go for a brisk walk or jog.</p>
<p>If time allows, our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCOFCwvhDoUvYcfpD7RJKQwA">YouTube Channel</a> has endless home workouts that take no equipment and only minutes of your day!</p>
<p>One thing we DO NOT want you to do is use verbiage like “earning” your dinner. Food is not some sort of reward and exercise should not be seen as punishment. Treat your holiday workout just like you would any other day of the year. Do it because you are ABLE and because it’s part of your lifestyle.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAK UP&#8230;</strong><br />
Do not be shy when it comes to telling people about your healthy lifestyle. Tell everyone about why it is important to you! It will hopefully keep them from guilting you into overeating or making comments about your choices. You never know, you may even motivate them to do the same. To help them get started and point them in the right direction. you can always encourage them to take our <a href="https://vshred.com/sp/survey/survey-aka1/">FREE body type quiz!</a></p>
<p><strong>STAY OFF THE SCALE…</strong><br />
While one meal, or even a few, will not wreck your progress, it most likely will have temporary effects on your weight. If you eat lots of food, all of that volume will be sitting in your stomach until it fully digests. The weight gain you see is not FAT GAIN. Most of what you see on the scale will be fluid retention. Not to mention other factors that can cause the scale to go up. Things like stress, lack of sleep, and even travel.</p>
<p>Holidays aside, remember that even on a typical day, weight can fluctuate several pounds. The holidays are no different. Take a scale break. Before you weigh yourself post-holiday, give your body at least 3-5 days to normalize.</p>
<p><strong>ENJOY EVERY BITE&#8230;</strong><br />
Worrying about weight gain is way more unhealthy than any temporary pounds you may (but most likely will not) pack on.</p>
<p>We aren’t saying that it is okay to “overindulge” just because it’s a holiday.<br />
We are saying that a few days of enjoying yourself WILL NOT derail your progress.</p>
<p>Stressing out over the holidays isn’t going to do anything except make you less likely to enjoy your time with friends and family. In fact, all that anxiety can backfire and be the reason you overeat. Having a preoccupation with food often causes people to go to ‘extremes’ and do things like binge-eat. Stress also raises your cortisol levels, which can lead to scale fluctuations and even excess fat storage.</p>
<p>If you have a problem controlling your anxiety, you may want to grab some <a href="https://sculptnation.com/product/neuroctane/">Sculpt Nation NEUROCTANE</a>. This product features adaptogens that naturally reduce stress and raise dopamine and serotonin levels. You will naturally feel more relaxed in those stress and anxiety-filled situations.</p>
<p>We know the holidays are an expensive time of year, so we teamed up with Sculpt Nation to bring you a <strong>major discount </strong>on the supplements that melt fat, build lean muscle, and revitalize your health.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Don’t let the holiday cash-crunch bring you down. Get all Sculpt Nation supplements (including the ones I mentioned earlier ) <a href="https://sculptnation.com/shop/">40% off when you use code: MERRY40 at checkout! Click Here</a>.</p>

<p><strong>REMEMBER&#8230;</strong> the holidays are about more than food. Shift your focus to making memories that don’t involve eating. Do not be so focused on food and weight gain that you miss out on what is important this Holiday season. You can’t redo life once it’s passed you by!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>From our V SHRED family to yours, we wish you a HAPPY (and stress-free) HOLIDAY.</strong></p>

<p>Let’s start off by making one thing clear …. <strong>CARBS ARE NOT THE ENEMY!</strong> For whatever reason, carbs have gotten a bad reputation. People think if you are on a diet and even look at a piece of bread, you will get fat. <strong>THIS IS NOT TRUE!</strong> OVEREATING any macro (carb/fat/protein) and being in an overall calorie surplus is what causes weight gain.</p>
<p>Taking carbs out of your diet is a recipe for disaster for most people. This is because any overly restrictive diet could lead to an unhealthy mental relationship with food and major cravings. This usually leads to binge eating or giving up on your “diet” altogether.</p>
<p>A low carb diet is just <strong>NOT SUSTAINABLE</strong> for most people. This means any weight you lose will come back and often with a few EXTRA pounds. Skipping out on carbs also makes most people feel pretty lousy, especially if they are exercising. This is because carbs are our body&#8217;s primary fuel source. Our body WANTS and NEEDS carbs. No carbs&#8230; no fuel!</p>
<p><strong>Reducing your intake of healthy carbs can lead to several problems:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A sluggish metabolism</li>
<li>Hormone issues</li>
<li>Mood Swings</li>
<li>Lethargy</li>
</ul>
<p>Now you may be shaking your head because you have seen results, or seen other people get results, eating little to no carbs.<strong> YOU ARE RIGHT</strong>…. Low-carb diets can help many people lose weight. But so can ANY diet that restricts calories. Not to mention, the rapid initial weight loss often seen on a low-carbohydrate diet is mostly water, not body fat.</p>
<p>The moral of this story is that it doesn’t make sense to overly restrict any macro-nutrient.<br />
You should never see foods as “good or bad” because this creates a very unhealthy relationship with food.</p>
<p>Hopefully, you get it …<strong> CARBS ARE NOT BAD,</strong> but there may be better times to eat the majority of your daily carb allowance. <strong>Find out the <em>best</em> and the <em>worst</em> times to eat carbs in the video below!</strong></p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='1170' height='659' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/MA3oCc9PK-M?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></p>
<p>Most people feel better when they have sufficient carbs in their diet. How many carbs you should eat depends on many things, such as …</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Goals</strong> (fat loss, muscle gain, maintenance)</li>
<li><strong>Activity level</strong> (sedentary, weight-training, endurance athlete)</li>
<li><strong>Genetics</strong> (different body types, medical conditions)</li>
</ul>
<p>Knowing the best times and the worst times to eat carbs is essential to any weight goal. But if you want to make sure those extra carbs are shuttled into your muscle cells and<strong> NOT</strong> your fat cells you’ll want to destroy every single workout no matter how tired you are. Imagine every workout having the capability to lift more weights for more reps and recover rapidly between sets and between workouts&#8230; Sound like a dream? It’s not.</p>
<p>It’s a delicious reality called <strong>PRE Workout</strong> and it has the power to wipe out fatigue before it ever hits your brain. This isn’t your grandpa’s sugar+caffeine “pre-workout” drink… we’re talking about optimizing neurotransmitters to crush mental and physical fatigue so you can kill it in the gym Every. Single. Time. <strong>Click Below To Weaponize Your Carb Intake And Hit The Gym Fresh, Strong, And Ready To Get Leaner Every Workout.</strong></p>

]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 style="text-align: center;">5 Unhealthy Foods Hiding In Your Pantry Right Now</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most people tend to have a pretty good understanding of what dictates a ‘</span><i style="font-size: 1rem;"><span>healthy’ </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">diet – but that doesn’t mean that they have it sorted completely.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In fact, there are several foods that most people consider healthy on nothing but face value, but are actually </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">terrible</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for you and all aspects of your health. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sadly most of these foods can be found inside your pantry right now. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, without further ado, prepare yourselves for the top 5 </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“healthy” </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">foods to stay away from.</span></p>
<h3>1.) Fruit Juice</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even though fruit juice does indeed contain several important vitamins and minerals, that does not make them healthy.</span><img class="aligncenter wp-image-6320 size-large" src="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/FRUITJUICE-BLOG.jpg?resize=1024%2C759&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="759" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/FRUITJUICE-BLOG.jpg?resize=1024%2C759&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/FRUITJUICE-BLOG.jpg?resize=300%2C222&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/FRUITJUICE-BLOG.jpg?resize=768%2C569&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/FRUITJUICE-BLOG.jpg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/FRUITJUICE-BLOG.jpg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You see, these juices are also packed to the brim with both sugar and additives, literally making them as bad as most soft drinks. Seriously, these guys offer a one-way ticket to unwanted</span><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3969361/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">weight gain, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You want a healthy ‘fruit-related’ snack? </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Try a piece of actual fruit.</span></p>
<h3>2.) Cereal</h3>
<p>Cereal has long been considered one of the healthiest breakfast options available – so much so that it even takes up the largest chunks of the recommended dietary pyramid that many people are so very fond of.</p>
<p><img class="size-large wp-image-6324" src="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/AdobeStock_107112724-3-copy.jpeg?resize=1024%2C977&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="977" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/AdobeStock_107112724-3-copy.jpeg?resize=1024%2C977&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/AdobeStock_107112724-3-copy.jpeg?resize=300%2C286&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/AdobeStock_107112724-3-copy.jpeg?resize=768%2C733&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/AdobeStock_107112724-3-copy.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, even the healthiest of cereals are chock full of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">processed carbohydrates</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Processed carbohydrates are essentially whole grains that have been refined beyond recognition. As a result, they are extremely high in energy content and absorbed by the body at an absurdly rapid rate. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is a reason that increased consumption of these foods has been linked to an increased risk of</span><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2869506/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">weight gain and diabetes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – because they are not very good for you…</span></p>
<h3>3.) Yogurt</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, let&#8217;s be clear for a second – pure, untouched and unprocessed Greek yogurt is quite good for you.</span></p>
<p><img class="size-large wp-image-6323" src="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/AdobeStock_53196251.jpeg?resize=683%2C1024&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="683" height="1024" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/AdobeStock_53196251.jpeg?resize=683%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 683w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/AdobeStock_53196251.jpeg?resize=200%2C300&amp;ssl=1 200w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/AdobeStock_53196251.jpeg?resize=768%2C1152&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/AdobeStock_53196251.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/AdobeStock_53196251.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 683px) 100vw, 683px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the other stuff? Not so much.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In fact, not at all. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most other yogurts have had an abundance of sugar added to them, which seriously increases their energy content. Additionally, as they have been heavily refined, they have been completely stripped of their nutritional value.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They’re basically a junk food at this point.</span></p>
<h3>4.) Dried Fruit</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At first look, dried fruit looks like the perfect snack. I mean, its fruit, right? And isn’t fruit supposed to be good for you?</span></p>
<p><img class="size-large wp-image-6319" src="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/AdobeStock_184565949.jpeg?resize=1024%2C508&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="508" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/AdobeStock_184565949.jpeg?resize=1024%2C508&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/AdobeStock_184565949.jpeg?resize=300%2C149&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/AdobeStock_184565949.jpeg?resize=768%2C381&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/AdobeStock_184565949.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/AdobeStock_184565949.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>While the short answer to that question is a resounding yes, there is more to this story.<br />
During the drying process, the fruit is combined with sugar to help keep it from oxidizing and going rancid. This is also what dries it out and gives it that firm and chewy texture.</p>
<p>It is also what gives it its unbelievably sweet flavor…</p>
<p>So again, I recommend you steer clear.</p>
<h3>5.) Vegetable Oil</h3>
<p>Vegetable oils are commonplace in almost every household on the planet – which is unfortunate because they do very little for your health.</p>
<p>In fact, they make it worse.</p>
<p><img class="size-large wp-image-6322" src="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/AdobeStock_186426775.jpeg?resize=1024%2C685&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="685" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/AdobeStock_186426775.jpeg?resize=1024%2C685&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/AdobeStock_186426775.jpeg?resize=300%2C201&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/AdobeStock_186426775.jpeg?resize=768%2C514&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/AdobeStock_186426775.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/AdobeStock_186426775.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>Cheap vegetable oils are created using a pretty nasty process of refining, in which they are stripped down using various chemical compounds. As a result, their consumption has been linked to increases in <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22570770">inflammation, disease, and illness.</a></p>
<p>Which I assume you probably don’t want?</p>
<p>In my opinion, the best replacements here are olive oils and coconut oils, as they have not undergone any refining, and therefore do not contain any nasty chemicals.</p>
<h3>Take-Home Message</h3>
<p>Sometimes it&#8217;s in your best interest to not take everything at face value – so don’t assume that every “healthy” food is actually healthy. And obviously steer clear of the foods on this list – you will thank me for it later.</p>
<p>I know what you&#8217;re thinking, checking every label and ingredient list while grocery shopping sounds like a headache, and let’s be honest with how busy our lives are we all want to get in and out of the grocery store as fast as possible.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3 style="text-align: left;"><em>(You Really Don’t Need To Make Salads All The Time When Farm-Fresh Greens + Collagen Are Available In Just One Scoop A Day!)</em></h3>
<p>What if you could get all the nutrition you need for the day in about one minute flat&#8230;<em>how would that feel?</em> How much time could you save on your morning routine? Maybe you’d sleep a few minutes later, save money on grocery shopping, or feel confident you’re doing everything you need to do to stay healthy? Or maybe you’d workout a little less and and not feel guilty about it because you can still get the same results with less effort??</p>
<p>Maybe you’d have way more energy and stamina when you workout&#8230;and maybe you’d be able to save a little money because you can finally stop buying so many other supplements…</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>The right powdered greens could change your whole life!</em></p>
<div id="including" class="anchor"><img class="alignnone wp-image-6268 size-large" src="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/greens-salad.png?resize=1024%2C827&#038;ssl=1" alt="How To Get A Full Day’s Nutrition In One Minute FLAT" width="1024" height="827" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/greens-salad.png?resize=1024%2C827&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/greens-salad.png?resize=300%2C242&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/greens-salad.png?resize=768%2C620&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/greens-salad.png?w=1112&amp;ssl=1 1112w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Whatever you’d do instead if you didn’t always have to eat salads or cook vegetables&#8230;I’m here to let you know <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>y</strong><strong>ou can stop wishing that lifestyle was real.</strong></span> And it’s not gonna mess up your budget or cost you your entire paycheck, either&#8230;</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Because I Found The Perfect Greens Powder </strong><strong>That You Can Mix With Water </strong><em><strong>(..tastes amazing, too!)</strong></em></h3>
<p>See&#8230;the truth is lots of greens powders aren’t made in FDA-registered facilities. What this means is lots of greens powders don’t have government oversight…which increases the chance that you might have unhealthy ingredients like bacteria or heavy metals in them. You can easily avoid this by just using supplements like the one I am about to recommend…</p>
<p>Supplements that are manufactured in FDA-registered facilities so you won’t risk making yourself sick.<br />
People all over the country feel like this about this company. And there’s no reason why you can’t feel the same way!</p>
<h3>FACT: Your Average Green Powder Tastes Like Grass</h3>
<p>As you probably already know, greens powder is made from dried greens. There’s nothing too complicated about it. But the problem is because it’s so simple to make a green powder, lots of companies skimp out on small details that make the difference between a good powder and a GREAT one.</p>
<p><strong>It happens all the time.</strong></p>
<p>That’s why I spent so much time looking for the perfect green powder. Like you, I can go eat a salad anytime I want. But I wanted something more. I wanted a green powder that…</p>
<ul>
<li>Helped me to burn fat faster</li>
<li>Killed inflammation</li>
<li>Made my brain even healthier</li>
<li>Gave me more energy throughout the day</li>
<li>Improved my physical appearance and helped me with my skin</li>
<li>Detoxified my body</li>
<li>Boosted my immune system</li>
<li>And optimized my workouts!</li>
</ul>
<p>Because while greens are <em>definitely</em> necessary  for us to survive and thrive…we also need just a little more than that. We need a diverse blend of nutrition.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://sculptnation.com/product/greens/">Sculpt Nation Greens &#8211; The Ultimate Green Powder Mixture!</a></h3>
<p><img class="size-large wp-image-6279 alignnone" src="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/GREENS-FL-juice-01-FB.png?resize=1024%2C536&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="536" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/GREENS-FL-juice-01-FB.png?resize=1024%2C536&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/GREENS-FL-juice-01-FB.png?resize=300%2C157&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/GREENS-FL-juice-01-FB.png?resize=768%2C402&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/GREENS-FL-juice-01-FB.png?w=1200&amp;ssl=1 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>Everyone already knows you need fruits and vegetables to be your healthiest. But what you might not know is the best green powder needs to have protein in it, too. I did a lot of research and discovered that the healthiest kind of protein for us to consume is one that is already found in abundance in your body.</p>
<p>That protein is collagen</p>
<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em><strong>According to research, here’s what collagen does for you:</strong></em></span></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>It helps your skin:</strong> You’ll look younger, have fewer wrinkles, and you’ll recover from skin injuries better and faster.</li>
<li><strong>It makes your joints more flexible and less painful:</strong> This means workouts will feel better, you’ll be less likely to hurt your joints while walking, running, or exercising.</li>
<li><strong>It’ll keep your bones strong as you get older</strong>: This is important for both men and women since we both lose bone density and strength with age.</li>
<li><strong>Your muscle gains will come easier:</strong> Your muscles LOVE collagen. It helps grow muscle strength and size after exercise.</li>
<li><strong>Your heart will be healthier:</strong> Collagen keeps your heart, arteries, and blood vessels strong. A healthy heart also means more effective exercise.</li>
<li><strong>Your hair will be healthier and fuller:</strong> Which could possibly keep you from going bald or having lots of hair shedding as you get older.</li>
</ul>
<p>And this list goes on and on. I can go on and on about how healthy collagen is for us <strong>which is why I&#8217;m so excited to find a greens powder that has it.</strong> In addition to collagen, it has fruit, the antioxidant turmeric, ashwagandha in it!</p>
<p>When you put all these ingredients together, you get a powerful, blended-greens powder that does all the things I mentioned and tastes so good you’ll be tempted to drink it all day long&#8230;</p>
<p><em><strong>So I’d like to introduce you to&#8230;</strong></em></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>30-seconds, 1 scoop = a better body &amp; dramatically improved mental and physical health.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The first Superfood Blended Greens Powder designed specifically for people who eat clean and want to maximize muscle build, maintain their ideal weight (or burn fat fast), and save time in their healthy routine.</p>
<p>If you’ve been burned by “green” products in the past… if you were promised superfood shake and instead got bottom-of-the-barrel vitamins in a sludgy liquid that tasted like gasoline doused with fermented weeds…</p>
<p>Don’t worry…<strong>We OBSESS on taste.</strong></p>
<p>We’ve made all flavors of GREENS, including the brand new <strong>Strawberry</strong> and <strong>Peach</strong> flavors taste so sinfully delicious that you’d swear you’re breaking your diet with every sip.
