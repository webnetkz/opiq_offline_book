								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 style="text-align: center;">5 Unhealthy Foods Hiding In Your Pantry Right Now</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most people tend to have a pretty good understanding of what dictates a ‘</span><i style="font-size: 1rem;"><span>healthy’ </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">diet – but that doesn’t mean that they have it sorted completely.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In fact, there are several foods that most people consider healthy on nothing but face value, but are actually </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">terrible</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for you and all aspects of your health. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sadly most of these foods can be found inside your pantry right now. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, without further ado, prepare yourselves for the top 5 </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“healthy” </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">foods to stay away from.</span></p>
<h3>1.) Fruit Juice</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even though fruit juice does indeed contain several important vitamins and minerals, that does not make them healthy.</span><img class="aligncenter wp-image-6320 size-large" src="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/FRUITJUICE-BLOG.jpg?resize=1024%2C759&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="759" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/FRUITJUICE-BLOG.jpg?resize=1024%2C759&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/FRUITJUICE-BLOG.jpg?resize=300%2C222&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/FRUITJUICE-BLOG.jpg?resize=768%2C569&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/FRUITJUICE-BLOG.jpg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/FRUITJUICE-BLOG.jpg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You see, these juices are also packed to the brim with both sugar and additives, literally making them as bad as most soft drinks. Seriously, these guys offer a one-way ticket to unwanted</span><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3969361/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">weight gain, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You want a healthy ‘fruit-related’ snack? </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Try a piece of actual fruit.</span></p>
<h3>2.) Cereal</h3>
<p>Cereal has long been considered one of the healthiest breakfast options available – so much so that it even takes up the largest chunks of the recommended dietary pyramid that many people are so very fond of.</p>
<p><img class="size-large wp-image-6324" src="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/AdobeStock_107112724-3-copy.jpeg?resize=1024%2C977&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="977" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/AdobeStock_107112724-3-copy.jpeg?resize=1024%2C977&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/AdobeStock_107112724-3-copy.jpeg?resize=300%2C286&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/AdobeStock_107112724-3-copy.jpeg?resize=768%2C733&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/AdobeStock_107112724-3-copy.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, even the healthiest of cereals are chock full of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">processed carbohydrates</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Processed carbohydrates are essentially whole grains that have been refined beyond recognition. As a result, they are extremely high in energy content and absorbed by the body at an absurdly rapid rate. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is a reason that increased consumption of these foods has been linked to an increased risk of</span><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2869506/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">weight gain and diabetes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – because they are not very good for you…</span></p>
<h3>3.) Yogurt</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, let&#8217;s be clear for a second – pure, untouched and unprocessed Greek yogurt is quite good for you.</span></p>
<p><img class="size-large wp-image-6323" src="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/AdobeStock_53196251.jpeg?resize=683%2C1024&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="683" height="1024" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/AdobeStock_53196251.jpeg?resize=683%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 683w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/AdobeStock_53196251.jpeg?resize=200%2C300&amp;ssl=1 200w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/AdobeStock_53196251.jpeg?resize=768%2C1152&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/AdobeStock_53196251.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/AdobeStock_53196251.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 683px) 100vw, 683px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the other stuff? Not so much.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In fact, not at all. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most other yogurts have had an abundance of sugar added to them, which seriously increases their energy content. Additionally, as they have been heavily refined, they have been completely stripped of their nutritional value.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They’re basically a junk food at this point.</span></p>
<h3>4.) Dried Fruit</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At first look, dried fruit looks like the perfect snack. I mean, its fruit, right? And isn’t fruit supposed to be good for you?</span></p>
<p><img class="size-large wp-image-6319" src="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/AdobeStock_184565949.jpeg?resize=1024%2C508&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="508" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/AdobeStock_184565949.jpeg?resize=1024%2C508&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/AdobeStock_184565949.jpeg?resize=300%2C149&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/AdobeStock_184565949.jpeg?resize=768%2C381&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/AdobeStock_184565949.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/AdobeStock_184565949.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>While the short answer to that question is a resounding yes, there is more to this story.<br />
During the drying process, the fruit is combined with sugar to help keep it from oxidizing and going rancid. This is also what dries it out and gives it that firm and chewy texture.</p>
<p>It is also what gives it its unbelievably sweet flavor…</p>
<p>So again, I recommend you steer clear.</p>
<h3>5.) Vegetable Oil</h3>
<p>Vegetable oils are commonplace in almost every household on the planet – which is unfortunate because they do very little for your health.</p>
<p>In fact, they make it worse.</p>
<p><img class="size-large wp-image-6322" src="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/AdobeStock_186426775.jpeg?resize=1024%2C685&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="685" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/AdobeStock_186426775.jpeg?resize=1024%2C685&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/AdobeStock_186426775.jpeg?resize=300%2C201&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/AdobeStock_186426775.jpeg?resize=768%2C514&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/AdobeStock_186426775.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/AdobeStock_186426775.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>Cheap vegetable oils are created using a pretty nasty process of refining, in which they are stripped down using various chemical compounds. As a result, their consumption has been linked to increases in <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22570770">inflammation, disease, and illness.</a></p>
<p>Which I assume you probably don’t want?</p>
<p>In my opinion, the best replacements here are olive oils and coconut oils, as they have not undergone any refining, and therefore do not contain any nasty chemicals.</p>
<h3>Take-Home Message</h3>
<p>Sometimes it&#8217;s in your best interest to not take everything at face value – so don’t assume that every “healthy” food is actually healthy. And obviously steer clear of the foods on this list – you will thank me for it later.</p>
<p>I know what you&#8217;re thinking, checking every label and ingredient list while grocery shopping sounds like a headache, and let’s be honest with how busy our lives are we all want to get in and out of the grocery store as fast as possible.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Make your mornings more exciting with our delicious pumpkin spice protein pancakes.</p>
<p>You can still enjoy eating the right amount of calories and protein with pumpkin spice protein shakes as well as pumpkin spice protein bars, which are often more popular options. For today, however, we will teach you how to make pumpkin spice protein pancakes to fill you up in the morning.</p>
<h2>How to Make Delicious Pumpkin Spice Protein Pancakes</h2>
<p><a href="https://sculptnation.com/product/protein-vanilla/?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=post&amp;utm_campaign=v-shred&amp;utm_content=pumpkin-spice-protein-Blog-Post-Vanilla-Protein&amp;utm_term=5"><img class="alignnone wp-image-4599 size-full" src="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Pumpkin-Pancake-with-Butter-Pumpkin-Spice-Protein-Pancakes.jpg?resize=625%2C615&#038;ssl=1" alt="Delicious Pumpkin Pancake | Pumpkin Spice Protein Pancakes" width="625" height="615" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Pumpkin-Pancake-with-Butter-Pumpkin-Spice-Protein-Pancakes.jpg?w=625&amp;ssl=1 625w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Pumpkin-Pancake-with-Butter-Pumpkin-Spice-Protein-Pancakes.jpg?resize=300%2C295&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Pumpkin-Pancake-with-Butter-Pumpkin-Spice-Protein-Pancakes.jpg?resize=60%2C60&amp;ssl=1 60w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h3>Ingredients:</h3>
<ul>
<li>2 eggs</li>
<li>1/2 cup pumpkin puree</li>
<li>1/2 tsp pumpkin pie spice</li>
<li>1/8 tsp baking powder (optional)</li>
<li><a href="https://sculptnation.com/product/protein-chocolate/"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>1</strong><strong> scoop Sculpt Nation Vanilla Protein Powder</strong></span></a></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> If you can’t find pumpkin pie spice at your local grocery store, you can simply blend cinnamon and nutmeg.</p>
<h3>Step 1: Make the Pancake Mixture</h3>
<p>Combine the eggs, pumpkin puree, pumpkin pie spice, baking powder, and protein powder in a large mixing bowl. Use a whisk to mix them together until they form a rich, creamy texture.</p>
<h3>Step 2: Prep the Cooking Pan</h3>
<p>Next, coat your frying pan with some non-stick cooking spray. Afterward, heat it over medium heat.</p>
<h3>Step 3: Fry the Pumpkin Spice Protein Pancake</h3>
<p>Add two to three tablespoons of the pancake mixture. Fry it for two minutes per side until bubbles form in the center, and the edges become crispy.</p>
<h3>Step 4: Adjust to Taste and Serve</h3>
<p>Don’t be afraid to add a few healthy fruits and berries on top to make the meal more satisfying. We suggest throwing in some fruits, nut butter, or honey for a more decadent taste. Serve immediately after cooking.</p>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> Store any leftovers in the refrigerator, or bring them with you to work as a healthy snack.</p>

<h3>When Should I Eat My Pumpkin Spice Protein Pancakes?</h3>
<p>Many choose to eat their pancakes in the morning. However, you can actually enjoy your pumpkin spice protein pancakes any time you want to. Since these pancakes offer enough protein and fats to keep you energized throughout the day, you can eat them at lunch or after a workout session.</p>
<p>Instead of eating high-calorie junk like chips, candies, and cakes, opt to snack on some nutritious pumpkin pancakes instead. <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/healthy-snacking-snack-options/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Healthy snacking</a> is a great way to stay in track with your fitness goals.</p>
<p>Similarly, eating these pancakes is a great way to mix up your <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/what-eat-after-workout/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">post-workout routine</a>. They have enough protein, fats, and carbs to help your muscles recover as fast as possible.</p>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> Try to eat them within 30 minutes of finishing a workout. This timeframe is the anabolic window in which your muscles are most susceptible to utilizing nutrients you feed them. During this short period, the body switches from a catabolic to an anabolic state. Consuming enough nutrients during your anabolic window is important to ensure muscle growth.</p>

<p>These pumpkin spice protein pancakes are just one of the pumpkin spice <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/healthy-protein-shake-recipes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">protein powder recipes</a> to try this fall. Don’t be afraid to let your creativity run wild when you’re in the kitchen.</p>
<p>Overall, the goal is to only use healthy, all-natural, low-calorie ingredients as much as possible. Remember: you need to <a href="https://vshred.com/sp/recipe-guide/v1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">eat meals with enough nutrients</a> to help your body become fitter and leaner.</p>

<h3>1. Omelet</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-5083 size-full" src="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/omelet-with-vegetables-and-cherry-tomatoes-what-to-eat-before-a-workout-ss.jpg?resize=625%2C400&#038;ssl=1" alt="Omelet | What To Eat Before A Workout To Boost Muscle Pumping Energy" width="625" height="400" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/omelet-with-vegetables-and-cherry-tomatoes-what-to-eat-before-a-workout-ss.jpg?w=625&amp;ssl=1 625w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/omelet-with-vegetables-and-cherry-tomatoes-what-to-eat-before-a-workout-ss.jpg?resize=300%2C192&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>Egg omelets make a great pre-workout meal. For one, eggs themselves are a good source of high-quality protein which helps build and maintain your muscles.</p>
<p>Omelets are also quite versatile. You can add different kinds of vegetables to them for a more delicious and nutritious pre-workout meal.</p>
<p><strong>When to eat:</strong> Eat a veggie omelet at least two to three hours before your actual workout starts.</p>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> You can make an <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/whole-eggs-vs-egg-whites-which-is-best-for-you/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">egg white</a> omelet by removing the yolk and whipping the egg whites as you would in a typical recipe.</p>
<h3>2. Chicken Sandwich on Whole-Grain Bread</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-5084 size-full" src="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/wheat-bread-sandwich-what-to-eat-before-a-workout-px.jpg?resize=625%2C400&#038;ssl=1" alt="Chicken Sandwich on Whole-Grain Bread | What To Eat Before A Workout To Boost Muscle Pumping Energy" width="625" height="400" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/wheat-bread-sandwich-what-to-eat-before-a-workout-px.jpg?w=625&amp;ssl=1 625w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/wheat-bread-sandwich-what-to-eat-before-a-workout-px.jpg?resize=300%2C192&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>A lightly-grilled chicken sandwich is another pre-workout meal option to consider. Like eggs, <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/chicken-veggies-stir-fry-recipe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">chicken breast</a> is also a great source of protein.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also a lean meat so you can eat it without worrying too much about taking in excess fat right before you work out.</p>
<p>When you&#8217;re assembling your sandwich, resist the urge to smear on those fatty and heavy spreads like mayonnaise and cream cheese. Instead, layer your sandwich with healthier ingredients like tomatoes and lettuce leaves.</p>
<p><strong>When to eat:</strong> This pre-workout sandwich is best eaten two to three hours before your scheduled workout regimen.</p>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> You can switch things up by substituting the chicken for slices of turkey breast.</p>
<h3>3. Lean Meat, Carb, and Veggie Meal</h3>
<p><!-- instagram error: invalid instagram resource --></p>
<p>For many gym rats, a plate complete with a protein, carb, and a veggie component is the go-to pre-workout meal to have. You&#8217;ll need a good balance of all three to keep you and your muscles energized throughout your workout.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a list of food items you can include in your pre-workout meal:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lean meats: chicken breast, turkey, and salmon</li>
<li>Carbs: brown rice, quinoa, and sweet potatoes</li>
<li>Veggies: roasted carrots, celery sticks, and cucumber slices</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>When to eat:</strong> Eat a complete pre-workout meal at least three hours before engaging in an intense workout program.</p>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> You can make your pre-workout meal in advance by following a few simple <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/how-to-meal-prep-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">meal prep guidelines</a>.</p>
<h3>4. Fruit Shake</h3>
<p><!-- instagram error: invalid instagram resource --></p>
<p>Fruit smoothies are great as a drinkable pre-workout snack. Fruits are sources of natural sugars that help fuel your body for a high-intensity workout.</p>
<p><strong>When to eat:</strong> Consider fruit shakes as a kind of pre-workout snack, so it&#8217;s best to have them at least two hours before starting your workout regimen.</p>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> You can easily turn your whole-fruit smoothie into a <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/healthy-protein-shake-recipes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">protein shake</a>. Do this by adding a few tablespoons of vanilla-flavored protein powder to the mix.</p>
<h3>5. Protein-Packed Oatmeal</h3>
<p><!-- instagram error: invalid instagram resource --></p>
<p>Try whipping up a bowl of oats the next time you&#8217;re looking for what to eat before a workout. Oats are high in protein which is an important component in muscle building.</p>
<p>Eating a single serving of oatmeal also fills you up so you don&#8217;t go into your workout with an empty stomach.</p>
<p><strong>When to eat:</strong> If your planning to eat a bowl of oats for your pre-workout snack, have it at least two hours before you hit the gym for your workout.</p>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> Jazz up your oatmeal by adding fresh blueberries, sliced almonds, and a drizzle of honey.</p>
<h3>6. PB&amp;J Sandwich</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-5085 size-full" src="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Peanut-butter-and-raspberry-jelly-sandwich-what-to-eat-before-a-workout-ss.jpg?resize=625%2C400&#038;ssl=1" alt="PB&amp;J Sandwich | What To Eat Before A Workout To Boost Muscle Pumping Energy" width="625" height="400" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Peanut-butter-and-raspberry-jelly-sandwich-what-to-eat-before-a-workout-ss.jpg?w=625&amp;ssl=1 625w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Peanut-butter-and-raspberry-jelly-sandwich-what-to-eat-before-a-workout-ss.jpg?resize=300%2C192&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>A PB&amp;J sandwich isn&#8217;t just something for the kids. You can snack on this American classic right before getting into a high-intensity workout regimen.</p>
<p>Nut butters contain protein and healthy fats that&#8217;ll help get your body go through a strenuous workout program.</p>
<p><strong>When to eat:</strong> Give yourself at least two hours to digest your peanut butter and jelly sandwich before you start working out.</p>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> Make your PB&amp;J out of all-natural and unsweetened nut butters and jellies. Substitute whole wheat bread for the usual white bread for added nutrition, too.</p>
<h3>7. Hard-Boiled Eggs</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-5146 size-full" src="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/eggs-love-valentine-s-day-heart-idea-what-to-eat-before-a-workout-cv.jpg?resize=625%2C417&#038;ssl=1" alt="Hard-Boiled Eggs | What To Eat Before A Workout To Boost Muscle Pumping Energy" width="625" height="417" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/eggs-love-valentine-s-day-heart-idea-what-to-eat-before-a-workout-cv.jpg?w=625&amp;ssl=1 625w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/eggs-love-valentine-s-day-heart-idea-what-to-eat-before-a-workout-cv.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>If you don&#8217;t have time to make a pre-workout omelet in the morning, you can just hard-boil a couple of eggs instead. Eggs are a great pre-workout food because they&#8217;re low-calorie and nutritionally balanced.</p>
<p>They&#8217;re also filled with body-building proteins, heart-healthy fats, and essential nutrients that help your muscles recover from intense strain brought about by a workout regimen.</p>
<p><strong>When to eat:</strong> Eat a hard-boiled egg at least two hours before you engage in an exercise regimen.</p>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> If you&#8217;re really pressed for time, you can hard-boil a dozen eggs over the weekend. Then you can keep them in your fridge throughout the week and just grab two or three before you hit the gym.</p>
<h3>8. Low-Fat Cottage Cheese</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-5087 size-full" src="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/cottage-cheese-with-berries-honey-and-nuts-what-to-eat-before-a-workout-ss.jpg?resize=625%2C400&#038;ssl=1" alt="Low-Fat Cottage Cheese | What To Eat Before A Workout To Boost Muscle Pumping Energy" width="625" height="400" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/cottage-cheese-with-berries-honey-and-nuts-what-to-eat-before-a-workout-ss.jpg?w=625&amp;ssl=1 625w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/cottage-cheese-with-berries-honey-and-nuts-what-to-eat-before-a-workout-ss.jpg?resize=300%2C192&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>Another great pre-workout snack to munch on is a small bowl of low-fat cottage cheese topped with dried fruits like apricots or raisins. In general, cheese contains tons of casein and whey proteins.</p>
<p>They fuel your muscles during an intense workout and even help your body recover right after.</p>
<p><strong>When to eat:</strong> Snack on a bowl of low-fat cottage cheese and dried fruit at least one hour before starting your actual workout regimen.</p>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> If you&#8217;re not in the mood for dried fruit, you can eat your cottage cheese with a sprinkling of sliced nuts or berries.</p>
<h3>9. Plain Greek Yogurt</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-5088 size-full" src="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/A-bowl-of-greek-yogurt-what-to-eat-before-a-workout-ss.jpg?resize=625%2C400&#038;ssl=1" alt="Plain Greek Yogurt | What To Eat Before A Workout To Boost Muscle Pumping Energy" width="625" height="400" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/A-bowl-of-greek-yogurt-what-to-eat-before-a-workout-ss.jpg?w=625&amp;ssl=1 625w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/A-bowl-of-greek-yogurt-what-to-eat-before-a-workout-ss.jpg?resize=300%2C192&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>Greek yogurt is also packed with casein and whey proteins, making it a good pre-workout snack to have. Other than containing these two important proteins, Greek yogurt is also a good source of easily digestible carbohydrates.</p>
<p>This gives your body enough energy to sustain you throughout your workout.</p>
<p><strong>When to eat:</strong> Eat a bowl of Greek yogurt at least one hour before your actual workout starts.</p>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> When buying Greek yogurt, make sure to get your hands on an all-natural and unsweetened variant. You can always flavor your yogurt with real fruits and natural sweeteners like honey and maple syrup.</p>
<h3>10. Fruits</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-5089 size-full" src="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/sliced-lemon-fruit-with-strawberry-and-blueberry-what-to-eat-before-a-workout-px.jpg?resize=625%2C400&#038;ssl=1" alt="Fruits | What To Eat Before A Workout To Boost Muscle Pumping Energy" width="625" height="400" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/sliced-lemon-fruit-with-strawberry-and-blueberry-what-to-eat-before-a-workout-px.jpg?w=625&amp;ssl=1 625w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/sliced-lemon-fruit-with-strawberry-and-blueberry-what-to-eat-before-a-workout-px.jpg?resize=300%2C192&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>Many fitness buffs reach for fruits as a pre-workout snack for a good reason. For one, they&#8217;re packed full with vitamins and nutrients which help your muscles function in and out of a workout.</p>
<p>They also contain natural sugars which your body uses as a source of energy.</p>
<p>We recommend you snack on these fruits before you head to the gym:</p>
<ul>
<li>bananas</li>
<li>apples</li>
<li>oranges</li>
<li>berries</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>When to eat:</strong> Eat a bowl of mixed fruits at least one hour before engaging in a workout regimen.</p>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> You can also use fruits as flavorings for many different <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/detox-drinks-weight-loss-best/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">weight-loss detox drinks</a>!</p>
<h3>11. Granola Bar</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-5090 size-full" src="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Granola-bars-on-wooden-background-what-to-eat-before-a-workout-ss.jpg?resize=625%2C400&#038;ssl=1" alt="Granola Bar | What To Eat Before A Workout To Boost Muscle Pumping Energy" width="625" height="400" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Granola-bars-on-wooden-background-what-to-eat-before-a-workout-ss.jpg?w=625&amp;ssl=1 625w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Granola-bars-on-wooden-background-what-to-eat-before-a-workout-ss.jpg?resize=300%2C192&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>Granola bars are great <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/healthy-snacking-snack-options/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pre-workout snacks</a> for three reasons. One, you get the benefits of eating fruits, oats, and nuts all by snacking on a single granola bar.</p>
<p>Two, they&#8217;re really handy so you can keep one to two bars in your gym bag at all times. Three, granola bars are low in calories yet high in protein and fiber.</p>
<p>This means a single bar can fuel your muscles and keep your stomach satisfied throughout your whole workout.</p>
<p><strong>When to eat:</strong> It&#8217;s best to have a granola bar at least one hour before starting your workout regimen.</p>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> When looking for a pre-workout fruit and nut bar, choose the one with a maximum of 200 calories and at least 5 grams of both protein and fiber.</p>

<h2>Best Way to Get Rid of Belly Fat | 10 Foods to Avoid</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>1. Full-Fat Dairy Products</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-4402 size-full" src="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/selective-focus-photo-of-cheese-best-way-to-get-rid-of-belly-fat-px.jpg?resize=625%2C400&#038;ssl=1" alt="Full-Fat Dairy Products | Foods to Avoid for a Flat Stomach |best way to get rid of belly fat" width="625" height="400" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/selective-focus-photo-of-cheese-best-way-to-get-rid-of-belly-fat-px.jpg?w=625&amp;ssl=1 625w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/selective-focus-photo-of-cheese-best-way-to-get-rid-of-belly-fat-px.jpg?resize=300%2C192&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>Full-fat dairy products are very high in calories and saturated fat. Be careful when buying products such as cheese, milk, and yogurt.</p>
<p>The next time you go shopping for dairy products, choose low-fat items instead. Additionally, opt to get your calcium from green leafy vegetables instead of full-fat dairy goods.</p>
<h3>2. Refined Carbohydrates</h3>
<p>A good way to get<a href="https://vshred.com/blog/how-to-get-a-flat-stomach/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> rid of belly fat</a> is to avoid foods with refined carbs, also known as &#8220;simple&#8221; carbs. They promote inflammation and weight gain. Plus, refined carbs spike your sugar levels.</p>
<p>Replace these foods with whole-grain, fiber-enriched foods instead, also known as &#8220;complex&#8221; carbs.</p>
<h3>3. Fried Foods</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-4403 size-full" src="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/potato-fries-with-fried-meat-on-white-plate-best-way-to-get-rid-of-belly-fat-px.jpg?resize=625%2C400&#038;ssl=1" alt="Fried Foods | Foods to Avoid for a Flat Stomach | best way to get rid of belly fat" width="625" height="400" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/potato-fries-with-fried-meat-on-white-plate-best-way-to-get-rid-of-belly-fat-px.jpg?w=625&amp;ssl=1 625w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/potato-fries-with-fried-meat-on-white-plate-best-way-to-get-rid-of-belly-fat-px.jpg?resize=300%2C192&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>One way to lose belly fat naturally is to avoid frying your food using cooking oil.</p>
<p>Due to its high-fat content, it takes much longer to digest these types of food. Plus, excessive amounts can lead to digestive tract complications such as acid reflux and heartburn.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re able to, choose to bake your meals instead of frying them. Switching to olive, coconut, or avocado oil will allow you to increase the amount of polyunsaturated and monounsaturated (healthy) fats in your diet while limiting the amount of saturated and trans fats in your diet.</p>
<h3>4. Candy and Soda</h3>
<p>These sugar-filled treats are full of empty calories. They offer no nutritional value so the body stores them as fat.</p>
<p>If you’re a fan of diet sodas, you might want to reconsider your choice of drink. It’s no healthier than regular soda and only increases your cravings for sweets.</p>
<p>To satisfy your sweet tooth, drink a glass of fruit-infused water instead. Add some slices of lemons and cucumbers for a cool, refreshing, and healthy alternative to soda and sweets.</p>
<h3>5. Alcohol</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-4404 size-full" src="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/clear-drinking-glass-best-way-to-get-rid-of-belly-fat-px.jpg?resize=625%2C400&#038;ssl=1" alt="Alcohol | Foods to Avoid for a Flat Stomach | best way to get rid of belly fat" width="625" height="400" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/clear-drinking-glass-best-way-to-get-rid-of-belly-fat-px.jpg?w=625&amp;ssl=1 625w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/clear-drinking-glass-best-way-to-get-rid-of-belly-fat-px.jpg?resize=300%2C192&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>If you really want to lose stubborn belly fat fast, then you need to avoid alcoholic drinks.</p>
<p>Similar to sodas, they’re filled with empty calories that offer zero nutritional value. Plus, it slows down your body’s fat-burning process.</p>
<p>If you’re going to drink alcohol, choose beverages with lower calories such as wine. Also, remember to drink water in between shots to prevent over-consumption. It’s also a great way to avoid a painful hangover.</p>
<h3>6. Salted Snacks</h3>
<p>To rid your body of fat, you need to avoid salted snacks such as potato chips. Salt retains water which makes you feel bloated and gain weight.</p>
<p>Choose <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/healthy-snacking-snack-options/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">healthier snacks</a> such as nuts, veggie slices, and whole grain crackers instead.</p>
<h3>7. Natural and Artificial Sweeteners</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-4405 size-full" src="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/beverages-cold-colourful-best-way-to-get-rid-of-belly-fat-px.jpg?resize=625%2C400&#038;ssl=1" alt="Natural and Artificial Sweeteners | Foods to Avoid for a Flat Stomach | best way to get rid of belly fat" width="625" height="400" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/beverages-cold-colourful-best-way-to-get-rid-of-belly-fat-px.jpg?w=625&amp;ssl=1 625w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/beverages-cold-colourful-best-way-to-get-rid-of-belly-fat-px.jpg?resize=300%2C192&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>Avoid processed foods with artificial sugars and high-fructose corn syrup. Similarly, fruit juices contain massive amounts of calories that may end up being stored as belly fat.</p>
<p>The best thing to do is to eliminate all processed foods from your diet. Then, instead of drinking fruit drinks, eat the fruits whole and fresh. Also, it’s best to juice vegetables for a refreshing, healthy drink.</p>
<h3>8. Diet Foods</h3>
<p>One of the best tips for losing belly fat is to steer clear of diet foods. Diet meals and shakes may contain heaps of sodium and preservatives. Also, some protein bars have a higher calorie-content than chocolate bars. If you&#8217;re going to consume protein bars, look for protein bars with less than 6 grams of sugar.</p>
<p>One of the best ways to lose belly fat is to make your own diet meals and protein bars instead. Choose all-natural ingredients brimming with vitamins and nutrients.</p>
<h3>9. Processed Meat</h3>

<p>Processed meats such as bacon, cold cuts, and hotdogs have high levels of saturated fats and calories. Excessive consumption might put you at risk of heart disease and stroke.</p>
<p>Ditch the processed foods and switch to fresh meat instead. But keep in mind that you should also observe moderation when eating fresh meat.</p>
<h3>10. Pre-Packaged Salads</h3>
<p>While vegetables are healthy, the dressings that come with pre-packaged salads are high in trans fat and calories. The same goes for sides such as cheese and croutons.</p>
<p>If you want to achieve a shredded physique, drop the salad dressings. Make your own using lemon juice, non-fat yogurt, and vinaigrette instead.</p>

<p>The main reason we strongly suggest trying this post-workout cookie recipe is it has most of the nutrients you need for muscle recovery. During the first 30 minutes <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/what-to-eat-after-a-workout/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">after a workout</a>, your body switches from a catabolic to an anabolic state.</p>
<p>This means it needs at least enough protein and carbs to <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/how-to-gain-muscle-mass/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">maximize muscle growth</a>. It’s also the reason many fitness buffs take protein shakes after their workouts.</p>
<p>If you’re looking for a snack to eat in place of protein shakes, this easy <span>low-carb protein cookie recipe</span> is what you need. It has protein and carbs but does not contain any gluten.</p>
<p>This means most of the nutrients you consume will help build your muscles. None of them will turn to fat. Plus, our post-workout cookie recipe is definitely healthier compared to other snacks.</p>
<h3>Why Diets Fail</h3>
<p>One common reason diets fail is that people tend to snack too much. Not just after their workouts, but also in between meals.</p>
<p>Since it may be a bit difficult to completely stop snacking, you should find another way around it. What you can do is try healthier options like this protein cookie recipe.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Remember that the key to having a rocking body is to maintain a healthy balance between your workouts and <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/easy-healthy-meals-quick-healthy-recipes-for-breakfast/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">your diet</a>. You don’t need to give up sweets and snacks completely. All you need are healthier options that suit both your wants and needs.</p>
<p>So what are you waiting for? Grab an apron and try out this easy, delicious post-workout cookie recipe.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Healthy snacking plays an important role in staying fit. It effectively helps you maintain a good physique along with the right workout plan.</p>
<p>However, issues like which food make for the best healthy snacks and how to properly consume them are typical concerns, especially for those who want to start eating right. We have listed down below some questions that we answered in hopes of shedding some light on the subject.</p>
<h2>Healthy Snacking | Snacking Tips and Ideas for Your Diet</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>What Are Healthy Snacking Foods?</h3>
<p><!-- instagram error: invalid instagram resource --></p>
<p>Identifying which types of foods you should eat during snack time is important. This is the key to achieving <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/best-diets-weight-loss/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a well-balanced and clean diet</a>.</p>
<p>First off is to eat <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/high-protein-diet-plans/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">protein-rich foods</a> for your body&#8217;s energy restoration, maintenance, and growth. Foods like chicken and turkey, beef and lamb, salmon and tuna, milk and yogurt, and beans and lentils are some good choices for healthy snacks.</p>
<p>Just prepare a snack recipe that has either one of these protein-rich foods. The healthiest option is eating lean proteins that are low in trans and saturated fats.</p>
<p>Also, eat more fruits and vegetables because these are low in fat and calories. It’s best to keep dried fruits and raw veggies as snacks as they are packed with minerals, vitamins, and natural fiber.</p>
<p>Add healthy unsaturated fats to your snacks, too, to keep you moving, especially during workouts. Seeds, nuts, avocados, and olives are some of the sources for unsaturated fats.</p>
<h3>What Are Some of the Best Healthy Snacking Ideas?</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-1999 size-full" src="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/kale-chips-parmesan-cheese-on-wooden-healthy-snacking-ss.jpg?resize=625%2C418&#038;ssl=1" alt="What Are Some of the Healthy Snacking Ideas? | Healthy Snacking | Snack Options For A Clean Diet | healthy snacking foods" width="625" height="418" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/kale-chips-parmesan-cheese-on-wooden-healthy-snacking-ss.jpg?w=625&amp;ssl=1 625w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/kale-chips-parmesan-cheese-on-wooden-healthy-snacking-ss.jpg?resize=300%2C201&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>Too much potato chips consumption may mess up your clean diet, so take control when eating them. You can try and make some healthier alternatives like kale chips, which are low in calories and rich in essential nutrients.</p>
<p>Hard-boiled eggs are also another healthy snacking idea you should try. Eggs are a good source of protein and amino acids, which are great for your muscles.</p>
<p>A pure organic bar is an excellent snack, too! It’s an easy-to-carry treat that’s gluten-free and dairy-free.</p>
<p>For chocolate lovers, there’s still hope for you. You can eat 88% dark chocolate and pair it up with almond butter.</p>
<p>The combination of the two acts as an excellent antioxidant source and is high in fiber and monosaturated fats.</p>
<h3>How Can You Achieve Healthy Snacking?</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-1998 size-full" src="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/spaniard-model-sergi-constance-at-gym-room-eating-healthy-snacking-foter.jpg?resize=625%2C368&#038;ssl=1" alt="How Can You Achieve Healthy Snacking? | Healthy Snacking | Snack Options For A Clean Diet | healthy snacking ideas" width="625" height="368" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/spaniard-model-sergi-constance-at-gym-room-eating-healthy-snacking-foter.jpg?w=625&amp;ssl=1 625w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/spaniard-model-sergi-constance-at-gym-room-eating-healthy-snacking-foter.jpg?resize=300%2C177&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>To make sure you are on the right track, here are some tips on how you should eat healthy snacks.</p>
<ul>
<li>Go Whole Grain</li>
</ul>
<p>Eating whole-grain snacks fuel your energy and ensure power, too. High-fiber cereals or whole-grain low-salt pretzels are some good examples of this.</p>
<ul>
<li>Bring Breakfast Foods</li>
</ul>
<p>Some breakfast meals are wonderful for snacking. You can prepare low-sugar granola and bring it with you wherever you go.</p>
<ul>
<li>Try A Low-High Combination</li>
</ul>
<p>The low-high combination for your snacks brings a good balance to your diet. Eat a small amount of something that’s rich in healthy fat like peanut butter or a large amount of something light like apple slices.</p>
<ul>
<li>Don’t Forget About Nuts</li>
</ul>
<p>Unsalted nuts are excellent for <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/11-low-calorie-snacks-to-eat-throughout-the-day/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">your snack time</a>. Walnuts, peanuts, and almonds are examples of nuts that fill you up fast.</p>
<ul>
<li>Snack Mindfully</li>
</ul>
<p>Eating snacks is like eating your regular meal. You need to stop what you are doing and give your full time to eating them.</p>
<ul>
<li>Bring Snacks Wherever You Go</li>
</ul>
<p>Regardless if you’re working out or not, take some snacks with you. This way, you won’t be tempted to buy something that would break your clean diet.</p>
<h3>Why Is Healthy Snacking Important in Staying Fit?</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-1997 size-full" src="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/young-man-sportswear-running-on-treadmill-healthy-snacking-ss.jpg?resize=625%2C352&#038;ssl=1" alt="Why Healthy Snacking Is Important In Staying Fit? | Healthy Snacking | Snack Options For A Clean Diet | healthy snacks" width="625" height="352" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/young-man-sportswear-running-on-treadmill-healthy-snacking-ss.jpg?w=625&amp;ssl=1 625w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/young-man-sportswear-running-on-treadmill-healthy-snacking-ss.jpg?resize=300%2C169&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>You are already aware that healthy snacking is important in staying fit but discussing the great benefits of keeping a healthy snack adds more value to your clean diet.</p>
<ul>
<li>Increase In Nutritional Intake</li>
</ul>
<p>Consuming healthy snacks add to your essential nutrient intake. If you can add more fiber and minimize fat intake, then that would definitely double your body&#8217;s nourishment.</p>
<ul>
<li>Appetite Control</li>
</ul>
<p>Having snacks in between your meals does not allow you to become so hungry, which can either make you double your regular meal intake or force you to take junk foods. Snacking keeps hunger at bay, allowing you to consume a moderate amount of food on your next meal.</p>
<ul>
<li>Boost in Energy</li>
</ul>
<p>Snacks packed with healthy fats, protein, and complex carbohydrates help increase your energy levels. Complex carbs, for example, are a stable source of energy that fuels your body to do your activities, and exercises, in between meals.</p>
<ul>
<li>Better Concentration</li>
</ul>
<p>Healthy snacking improves concentration, especially during workouts. It also helps you get through your daily tasks quickly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Watch this video below to know about a healthy low-carb recipe you can prepare in 15 minutes:</strong></p>

<p>Healthy snacking is, indeed, a must if you want to stay fit and keep your figure. Not only that, it also provides excellent body and mind benefits you need to keep your day going.</p>
<p>A healthy and clean diet and a proper workout plan are what your body and mind deserve. After all, a balanced diet always comes with food control and discipline.</p>

]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Knowing what to eat after a workout is crucial, no matter what your fitness goal is. Your post-workout meal should be composed of foods that are easy to digest for faster nutrient absorption.</p>
<p>In addition, you need to consume it within 30 minutes after your workout for increased protein synthesis and glycogen storage. Your meal should be a combination of healthy fats, carbs, and protein. Check out these healthy and easy-to-make post-workout meals you can prepare for your next workout!</p>
<h2>What to Eat After a Workout: 7 Meals You Should Try!</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span style="color: #000080;">1. Rice Crackers and Peanut Butter</span></h3>
<p>For a quick, simple post-workout meal, you can opt for some rice crackers and peanut butter. This meal contains enough nutrients to ensure your body’s muscle recovery.</p>
<p>In fact, 100 grams of peanut butter has 25g of protein, 50g of fat, and 20g of carbohydrates. In addition, this meal does not require you to do any preparation. Just bring a jar of peanut butter and some rice crackers to the gym to be eaten after your workout.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #000080;">2. Protein Shake and Banana</span></h3>
<p>If you can’t decide on what to eat after a workout, then you can stick to the basic protein shake and banana combo. This proven combo is designed specifically for quick nutrient absorption during your anabolic window.</p>
<p>Throw in a scoop or two of your favorite protein powder into a cup, shake it, then have a banana to go with it. In under 10 minutes, you’ll have consumed enough nutrients to promote muscle growth and recovery.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #000080;">3. Avocado, Toast, and Eggs</span></h3>
<p>Eggs are praised in the fitness industry for their versatility and nutritional value. In fact, 100 grams of eggs have 13g of protein, 11g of fat, and only 155 calories.</p>
<p>Serve these eggs any way you want <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/healthy-snack-ideas-delicious-healthy-low-carb-meal-in-only-15-minutes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">alongside some avocados and toast</a> and you&#8217;ll have a delicious nutrient-packed post-workout meal.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #000080;">4. Cereal and Milk</span></h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-1657 size-full" src="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/cereals-strawberries-milk-what-to-eat-after-workout-US.jpg?resize=625%2C417&#038;ssl=1" alt="Cereal and Milk | What To Eat After A Workout | Food Options Post-Workout" width="625" height="417" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/cereals-strawberries-milk-what-to-eat-after-workout-US.jpg?w=625&amp;ssl=1 625w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/cereals-strawberries-milk-what-to-eat-after-workout-US.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>Do you know what to eat after a workout that requires virtually no preparation? Your favorite breakfast duo, cereal and milk, can actually be eaten at any time of the day.</p>
<p>For better nutrient consumption, you want to go for a brand that’s rich in protein and fiber but has low sugar content.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #000080;">5. Greek Yogurt, Berries, and Granola</span></h3>
<p><a href="https://vshred.com/blog/healthy-weight-loss-meals/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Greek yogurt</a> has less sugar and more protein than regular yogurt. This makes it an ideal component of your post-workout meal! If you have a cup of Greek yogurt, you don’t have to wonder about what to eat after a workout.</p>
<p>Just throw in some berries and granola in your Greek yogurt, and you&#8217;ll have a quick and easy post-workout meal.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #000080;">6. Grilled Chicken With Roasted Vegetables</span></h3>
<p>If you’re the type who prepares their meals in advance, then one post-workout meal you can try is grilled chicken with roasted vegetables. The chicken gives you the protein and fat you need while the vegetables provide you with minerals.</p>
<p>Grill a few pounds of chicken and veggies and put them in different containers to bring with you to eat after your workout.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #000080;">7. Cottage Cheese and Fruits</span></h3>
<p>If you ask a random gym-goer what to eat after a workout, they’ll most likely say something that involves either cottage cheese or fruits. Eating cottage cheese and fruits after a workout give you the protein, minerals, and carbohydrates you need for muscle growth. How much protein does it have? 226 grams of cottage cheese has around 28g of protein and only 163 calories.</p>
<p>On the other hand, fruits are packed with healthy and easy-to-digest carbohydrates.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Your pre-workout meal is just as important as your post-workout meal. Watch this video by V Shred about making a quick, healthy meal:</strong></p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='1170' height='659' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/lvto3DdoUVM?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></p>
<p>What you eat after a workout is as important as the workout itself. Stuffing your body with unhealthy foods will only put your hours of hard work at the gym to waste.</p>
<p>If you want to maximize the results of your training, you need to fuel your body with the right nutrients. Whether it’s to build muscles, lose fat, or maintain an active body, it’s very important to be mindful of what to eat after a workout.</p>

Level up your bland smoothie game with these 7 delicious homemade protein shake ideas! Ready to shake things up? Read on.</p>
<h2>7 Protein Shake Recipes You Should Try for Muscle Gain</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span style="color: #000080;">1. Apple-Kale Green Protein Shake</span></h3>
<p>What can you make out of some fibrous kale, a crunchy Granny Smith apple, cucumber, and 1-2 scoops of protein powder? A green, healthy smoothie with about 28g of high-quality protein! Not only can this low-sugar blend help you achieve that form you desire, it can also detoxify your system.</p>
<p><strong>Blend Together:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>1 Granny Smith apple (chop and remove the core)</li>
<li>1 cup almond milk</li>
<li>A small-sized cucumber (chopped)</li>
<li>1 teaspoon of lemon juice</li>
<li>1 cup of kale (raw, chopped)</li>
<li><a href="https://sculptnation.com/product/protein-vanilla/">1-2 scoops of Sculpt Nation Vanilla Protein Powder</a></li>
</ul>
<h3><span style="color: #000080;">2. Cafe Mocha Shake</span></h3>
<p>Ditch those sugar-loaded blended coffee drinks now. Here&#8217;s a healthier alternative for frappe lovers. Get the same kick of caffeine with added protein and minus the extra calories with this quick-to-make coffee-based smoothie.</p>
<p><strong>Blend Together:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>1 cup of coffee (chilled in the fridge overnight)</li>
<li>1 cup of almond milk</li>
<li><a href="https://sculptnation.com/product/protein-chocolate/">1-2 scoops of Sculpt Nation Protein Powder </a>(chocolate and/or vanilla)</li>
</ul>
<h3><span style="color: #000080;">3. Orange Juice With Protein (OJ-P)</span></h3>
<p>Because the normal OJ is pretty boring! Amp up your daily dose of orange juice by adding a few scoops of protein powder in the mix. Antioxidants, Vitamin C, and protein all in one drink? Sounds like a delicious win, wouldn&#8217;t you agree?</p>
<p><strong>Blend Together:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Freshly squeezed OJ right from the fruit</li>
<li><a href="https://sculptnation.com/product/protein-vanilla/">1-2 scoops of Sculpt Nation Vanilla Protein Powder</a></li>
<li>Sweetener (if desired)</li>
</ul>
<h3><span style="color: #000080;">4. Mango Blueberry Smoothie</span></h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-1733 size-full" src="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/fruit-smoothies-blueberries-strawberry-kiwi-banana-protein-shake-recipes-SS.jpg?resize=625%2C417&#038;ssl=1" alt="Mango Blueberry Smoothie | Healthy and Delicious Protein Shake Recipes To Get Big and Strong | homemade protein shake" width="625" height="417" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/fruit-smoothies-blueberries-strawberry-kiwi-banana-protein-shake-recipes-SS.jpg?w=625&amp;ssl=1 625w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/fruit-smoothies-blueberries-strawberry-kiwi-banana-protein-shake-recipes-SS.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>With mangoes packed with vitamins A &amp; C, antioxidants, dietary fiber, and blueberries with disease-preventing phytonutrients, this fusion yields a nutritious smoothie. Toss a tablespoon of chia seeds for omega-3 fat and fiber to the blend plus a scoop of protein powder. This smoothie will definitely become a totally healthy powerhouse!</p>

<ul>
<li>1/2 cup of mangoes</li>

</ul>
<h3><span style="color: #000080;">5. Toasted Coconut Protein Shake</span></h3>
<p>Having the same, uninspired protein shakes the whole week is <em>loco </em>boring. Break the monotony and go coco! Protein powder mixed with a cup of toasted coconut flakes makes for a protein-loaded, fiber-rich post- or pre-workout drink.</p>
<p><strong>Blend Together:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>1/4 cups of toasted coconut flakes (Simply toast flakes on a saucepan over medium fire)</li>

<li><a href="https://sculptnation.com/product/protein-vanilla/">1-2 scoops of Sculpt Nation Vanilla Protein Powder</a></li>
<li>1 cup of ice</li>
</ul>
<h3><span style="color: #000080;">6. Banana Cookies and Cream Protein Shake</span></h3>
<p>Sometimes, all the nutrients you need for breakfast are better blended in a smoothie. This breakfast protein shake recipe provides a great deal of energy with ample serving of fruits, spinach, and yogurt. To add a solid delightful yet -nutritious punch, bring in oats for added texture and cookies and cream-flavored protein powder!</p>
<p><strong>Blend Together:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>1 cup of 2% milk</li>

<p>Creamer on a protein shake? You&#8217;ll be surprised with the magic it could do, brother (or sister)! Enjoy the familiar (and enjoyable) taste of caramel hazelnut with this blend of peanut butter, yogurt, and our star —  hazelnut coffee creamer.</p>

</div>
<div></div>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://vshred.com/sp/survey/survey-aka1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">In order to get in shape fast, you can’t just focus on low calorie snacks. You must make sure you are following a full meal plan and exercise plan catered to your body type. Click here to take our body type quiz learn what plan will work fastest for you!</a></p>
<p class="p1">Snacking is one of the biggest reasons diets fail. It’s extremely common to snack on foods throughout the day without even realizing it.</p>
<p class="p1">Due to this snacking going unnoticed, people often eat hundreds, or even thousands of calories in one sitting.. And then have a full meal!</p>
<p class="p1">So here are 11 low calorie snacks to eat throughout the day. Also, when and/or why these snacks are beneficial.</p>
<h2 class="p1">Low Calorie Snacks</h2>
<h3 class="p1">Banana &amp; Peanut Butter</h3>
<p class="p1">The peanut butter in this snack is optional depending on how hungry you are. This is a great snack to have before you go to the gym as the carbs will fuel your muscles with glycogen. The peanut butter will be a good source of healthy fats which will help fill you up and add some taste.</p>
<h3 class="p1">Celery &amp; Peanut Butter</h3>
<p class="p1">This is just like the banana.. the peanut butter is optional depending on how hungry you are. Celery on it’s own is going to be extremely low calorie but may not be the tastiest. So adding a bit of peanut butter may help in multiple ways.</p>
<h3 class="p1">Apples &amp; Peanut Butter</h3>
<p class="p1">This snack is just like the banana and the celery. Meaning the peanut butter is optional. Apples are great snacks on their own. They are great sources of natural carbohydrates so they’re perfect for mornings and pre-workout. Adding the peanut butter will just help add a little extra taste to it and to help fill you up if you’re hungry.</p>
<h3 class="p1">Snack Pack Jello-O</h3>
<p class="p1">These are a great low calorie snack for anything with a sweet tooth. Each jello pack only contains 5 calories if you get the right ones. Just make sure you don’t get the ones that don’t say, “Snack Pack” as they contain more calories and aspartame.</p>
<h3 class="p1">Flavored Almonds</h3>
<p class="p1">These are a great source of healthy fats to help fill you up when you’re hungry. Find a flavor that you really enjoy and watch out for the sodium levels so that you don’t get bloated. Just be careful to limit yourself with how many you eat so that you don’t have too many.</p>
<h3 class="p1">Low Sugar Maple and Brown Sugar Instant Oatmeal</h3>
<p class="p1">This is a great snack for anybody who is wanting something sweet without all the sugar of sweets. Make sure that when you are at the store, you get the one that says 50% lower sugar otherwise, it will not be low calorie. This can be great in the morning or pre-workout as it will give you sustained energy for the day or your workout.</p>
<h3 class="p1">Hard Boiled Eggs</h3>
<p class="p1">These are great if you’re looking for a low calorie and low carb snack. Hard boiled eggs will be a great source of protein to help fuel your muscles and a great source of healthy fats to fuel your fat burn.</p>
<h3 class="p1">Skinny Pop Popcorn</h3>
<p class="p1">This is an amazing option for anyone who has a habit of just eating stuff throughout the day without realizing it. Instead of eating chips or sweets or anything unhealthy, this will be great to eat instead. Just be careful not to get the kind with more sodium as it will bloat you.</p>
<h3 class="p1">Low Sugar Yogurts</h3>
<p class="p1">This is a great snack that is also a great source of protein. If dairy upsets your stomach, go for the coconut yogurt or dairy free yogurt option. You can also add your favorite berries if you want. Just be careful not to add too much as it will increase your carb intake quickly.</p>
<h3 class="p1">Low Calorie Popsicles</h3>
<p class="p1">These are amazing for anyone with a sweet tooth to have instead of ice cream. Make sure you look at the calorie content of all the popsicles that your grocery store has available and find a nice balance between size, calories and a flavor you like.</p>
<h3 class="p1">WATER!</h3>
<p class="p1">This may seem silly but water is one of the best snacks to have throughout the day. Often times, when people think they’re hungry, they are actually dehydrated and need water. So the next time you’re hungry, drink down 8-10 oz of water. After 15 minutes, see how hungry you still are.</p>
<p class="p1">The next time you head to the grocery store, grab a couple of these for your pantry. That way the next time you go to the pantry to grab something to snack on, it doesn’t mess up your caloric intake.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>If you like these snacks, share this with your friends through social media! Also, leave any comments or questions you have down below!</strong></p>

<p>Simply add a half cup of crushed blueberries and orange wedges from a full orange to a 1 liter pitcher of water, and you&#8217;ll have a wonderful and healthy concoction. This detox water can boost your metabolism. Additionally, its antioxidant properties can help flush out your system.</p>
<div id="grapefruit" class="anchor"></div>
<h3><span style="color: #000080;">2. Grapefruit Mint Detox Water</span></h3>

This detox water is another nutritionally-packed one. Most of its health benefits come from its high Vitamin-C component in the citrus! These benefits include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Boost immunity</li>
<li>Good for your heart</li>
<li>Hydrating and low in calories</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>1 orange, sliced</li>
<li>1 lemon, sliced</li>
<li>1 lime, sliced</li>
<li>1 grapefruit, sliced</li>
<li>6 sprigs mint, lightly crushed</li>
</ul>
<div id="apple" class="anchor"></div>
<h3><span style="color: #000080;">3. Apple Cider Vinegar and Papaya Smoothie</span></h3>
