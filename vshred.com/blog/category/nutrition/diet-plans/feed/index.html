That is a scary number!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Good thing you found this article because </span><b><i>we aren’t going to let YOU be “most” people! </i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lower temps do not have to equal larger waistlines! You just have to have a plan! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this short read we will &#8230;</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Explain why winter weight gain happens. Knowing why is important if you want to prevent it and the reason is probably not what you think. In fact, it is partially not even your fault!</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tell you why fall/winter is actually the BEST time to start a diet and training plan.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Give you 7 easy pro tips that will help guide you through the next few months. </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You may believe winter weight gain happens because of the holidays. Those extra home cooked meals and holiday parties are certainly a factor. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But </span><b><i>there is a DAILY issue you need to be prepared to fight </i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">if you want to avoid packing on winter pounds.</span></p>
<p><b>WHY YOU REALLY PACK ON POUNDS AFTER LABOR DAY</b></p>
<p><img class="size-large wp-image-7471" src="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_130930953.jpeg?resize=1024%2C512&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="512" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_130930953.jpeg?resize=1024%2C512&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_130930953.jpeg?resize=300%2C150&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_130930953.jpeg?resize=768%2C384&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_130930953.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_130930953.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the spring and summer months, you are given what we call a</span><b> fitness freebie. </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You get a </span><b><i>seasonal motivation boost</i></b> <span style="font-weight: 400;">that doesn’t happen when temperatures start to drop, and you begin to pull out the chunky sweaters and comfy leggings. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not only is the sun shining (which makes you happier because of Vitamin D), you are wearing LESS clothing in the summer months. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I don’t know about you, but knowing I’m going to be exposing more skin makes walking in the gym a little easier. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Covering up in layers, no doubt leads to the temptation to slack on body goals! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Knowing your arms, legs, and abs will be less exposed can easily be an excuse to slack. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, being layered up often means you don’t SEE the extra pounds, so they are easier to ignore.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But there is more to it than being bundled up….</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-7477" src="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_236518834.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_236518834.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_236518834.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_236518834.jpeg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_236518834.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_236518834.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span>The #1 reason you slack on health and fitness goals in colder months ISN’T EVEN YOUR FAULT!!</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, you have a part to play in all of this, but</span><b><i> there is actually a scientific reason why you have less desire to train and eat healthy when the sunshine of summer fades.</i></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We will explain why a little further down. But ya know what really stinks? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The scientific reason why we all experience these motivation slumps in the winter only adds to an even bigger issue with motivation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span>It doesn’t matter what season it is motivation ALWAYS comes and goes!</p>
<p>Spring, Summer, Fall, or Winter &#8211; you can NEVER rely on it!</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, what can you do when lack of sunshine and warm temps leave you even more tempted to hit snooze and reach for comfort foods? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You certainly don’t throw your hands up in the air and wait until January to make a resolution to crash diet to get your body ready for spring. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Believe it or not, RIGHT NOW is actually the IDEAL time to get started! </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you </span><b><i>START NOW, </i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">you will develop discipline and a routine heading into the holidays. This will put you in a great place mentally and physically to relax and “indulge” a little more at all those holiday gatherings! </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><b><i>Look at it this way ..<br />
</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Would you rather head into the holiday season already making progress toward your goals and be in a great spot <em>(where it would be okay even if you did gain an extra pound or two?)</em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Or would you rather put it off and only add more fat on top of what you want to lose?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The answer is clear— the solution to getting the motivation needed to make it happen, not so much.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But don’t worry! We’ve got ya covered</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (no pun intended)</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with a few easy motivation hacks!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><b>7 TIPS TO STAY MOTIVATED AS SEASONS CHANGE</b></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><b><br />
</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the number one questions we always get is … “<em>I am just not motivated. How can I motivate myself to train and eat better?”</em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As we mentioned earlier, it doesn&#8217;t matter what season it is, </span><b><i>you can’t always rely on motivation. </i></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you have it, great! You should certainly take advantage of it! But you have to know that it is totally normal to not have much of it. Even professional athletes lack motivation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You have to develop other daily habits that create discipline if you want to succeed long term!</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are a few of our pro tips that we use with our clients, specifically when temperatures drop, and motivation seems to be at its lowest! </span></p>
<p><b>TIP #1: Switch To An At Home Training Program</b></p>
<p><img class="size-large wp-image-7448" src="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_185038762.jpeg?resize=1024%2C647&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="647" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_185038762.jpeg?resize=1024%2C647&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_185038762.jpeg?resize=300%2C189&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_185038762.jpeg?resize=768%2C485&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_185038762.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_185038762.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you know that getting out of bed and stepping into the winter elements is going to be an excuse trigger, make a plan to train at home during cooler months! Some of the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">most effective and challenging workouts </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">only require your body weight and </span><b><i>maybe</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a set of dumbbells or some resistance bands.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A good fat-blasting, muscle-building sweat session can 100% be achieved from the comfort of your home!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adjustable dumbbells, ankle weights, resistance bands, a jump rope, etc., are all things that are inexpensive and can easily be stored in a closet or under your bed and pulled out anytime you don’t feel like leaving the house.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But if you have </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">the right training program</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><b><i>you don’t need any of that. </i></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our favorite </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">at-home bodyweight-only program</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is called</span><b> MOVE. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was designed to help you achieve your fitness goals without a single piece of equipment, and each workout is under 20 minutes! </span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Learn more about MOVE by watching the video below!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you need </span><b>a little extra “nudge”</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to get up and get moving, another </span><b>pro-tip we use</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is keeping some </span><a href="https://sculptnation.com/products/pre-workout" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><b>PRE WORKOUT </b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">on your bedside table. Have it already blended up and chug it as soon as your alarm goes off!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By the time you have brushed your teeth and put on your workout clothes, you will have a nice little jolt of energy and</span><b><i> tons of motivation</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to get going before you have a chance to come up with an excuse! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the bottom of this article, we will tell you about a big end of summer sale happening so that you can stock up on our </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">favorite </span><a href="https://sculptnation.com/products/pre-workout" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><b>PRE WORKOUT</b></a><strong> for 40% off when you use code: LABORDAY40 at checkout! </strong></p>
<p><b>TIP #2: Make Your Workouts Seasonal</b></p>
<p><img class="size-large wp-image-7452" src="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_65703942.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_65703942.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_65703942.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_65703942.jpeg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_65703942.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_65703942.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Embrace the change of seasons and take advantage of activities that you can only do in fall or winter! </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Go on a fall hike and view all the gorgeous foliage.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Try rock climbing.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Walk around a corn maze or pumpkin patch with your family. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you live in a snowy climate, go skiing, sledding, build snowmen with your kids, etc.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Go ice skating.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lace-up your sneakers, go for a walk or run at night, and admire all the Christmas lights and decorations.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are some things you can only do and see during specific times of the year. So instead of missing sunshine and water sports, focus on all the positive things that only come about with cooler temps!</span></p>
<p><b>TIP #3: Try Something Totally New</b></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-7454" src="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_361152601.jpeg?resize=1024%2C514&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="514" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_361152601.jpeg?resize=1024%2C514&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_361152601.jpeg?resize=300%2C151&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_361152601.jpeg?resize=768%2C386&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_361152601.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_361152601.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sometimes a change of routine is all you need to boost motivation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you have been doing all your gym lifts alone, recruit a gym buddy! Try switching up your cardio by skipping your solo runs and joining a group fitness class instead. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another option is to </span><b><i>allow yourself to slow down!</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> If you have been crushing it all spring and summer with intense training and hardcore workouts, </span><b><i>it may actually be time to take it down a notch. </i></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Going full force 365 can cause your stress hormone cortisol to increase. This can lead to a host of drawbacks, including weight gain, muscle loss, poor moods, fatigue, and occasional issues sleeping! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We aren’t saying you should become lazy! But if you have been crushing it 24/7 all spring and summer, your body (and mind) may need to slow down.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Use the next few months to embrace a slower routine. </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Commit to daily yoga.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Focus on becoming more flexible.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Switch to low or moderate-intensity cardio, instead of HIIT.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Try out some bodyweight workouts instead of heavy lifting.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Giving your body a couple of months to recover might even make you more responsive when you decide to kick things up again come spring/summer!</span></p>
<p><b>TIP #4: Stay Accountable</b></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-7457" src="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_266584820.jpeg?resize=1024%2C768&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="768" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_266584820.jpeg?resize=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_266584820.jpeg?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_266584820.jpeg?resize=768%2C576&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_266584820.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_266584820.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><b><br />
</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">The best way to stick to a plan is to have someone that you report back to. This could be a friend, family member, a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">social media community</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, or even a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">coach. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Including someone else, or even just telling someone else about your health and fitness goals and asking them to check in with you to make sure you are sticking to the plan, is a great way to keep the promises you make to yourself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you prefer to fly solo, it helps to create visuals. Make a vision board, create a daily checklist you can mark off after each workout, or keep an accomplishment journal.</span></p>
<p><b>TIP #5: Set A Spring Goal</b></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-7458" src="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_47332240.jpeg?resize=1024%2C680&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="680" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_47332240.jpeg?resize=1024%2C680&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_47332240.jpeg?resize=300%2C199&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_47332240.jpeg?resize=768%2C510&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_47332240.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_47332240.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">March may seem like a long time away, but it will be back before you know it, and 6 months is a long time to make significant changes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Setting a goal is a great way to encourage yourself to push past discomforts and temptation, but there is a science to goal setting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The key to creating goals that stick .. </span><b><i>be REALISTIC and SPECIFIC!</i></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s start with </span><b><i>reality. </i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">You should always focus on one goal at a time and make sure you are being honest with yourself if that goal is really attainable.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you know that your schedule will never allow you to work out 6 days a week, why would you choose a program that requires you to do that?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you know it’s not healthy to attempt to lose 10 pounds a week, why would you aim that high?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you love carbs, why would you go on a KETO diet? </span></p>
<p><b><i>Doing these things will essentially set yourself up for failure.</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Set attainable goals that fit YOUR lifestyle. You can always bump things up if your schedule allows, or you notice you aren’t pushing yourself hard enough. Just keep in mind that being realistic isn’t the same as not believing in yourself or making excuses. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moving on to being </span><b><i>specific.</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The more specific you are about your goals, the more likely you will be to reach them. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It may seem like it’s good enough to say things like .. I want to look good, lose weight, or get ripped! </span><b><i>But you have to dig deeper than that!! </i></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wanting to “lose weight,” for example, is an excellent place to start. But ask yourself what that means to you?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you expand on that and say &#8212; “I want to lose 10 pounds of fat. I will do this by not eating any sweets and doing the V Shred </span><a href="https://vshred.com/sp/move/soc-all/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><b>MOVE </b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">program for 30 consecutive days. I am doing this because I want to have better self-esteem and a head start on bikini season.” &#8212; that makes your goal more specific.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The more specific (and attainable) your goals are, the more likely you will be to not give up!</span></p>
<p><b>TIP #6: Reward Yourself</b></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-7459" src="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/vin_sant_32048508_366936073798151_433609263865135104_n.jpg?resize=882%2C1024&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="882" height="1024" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/vin_sant_32048508_366936073798151_433609263865135104_n.jpg?resize=882%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 882w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/vin_sant_32048508_366936073798151_433609263865135104_n.jpg?resize=258%2C300&amp;ssl=1 258w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/vin_sant_32048508_366936073798151_433609263865135104_n.jpg?resize=768%2C892&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/vin_sant_32048508_366936073798151_433609263865135104_n.jpg?w=1080&amp;ssl=1 1080w" sizes="(max-width: 882px) 100vw, 882px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you have checked a “mini goal” off your list, treat yourself. Knowing that you have a reward coming to celebrate your efforts will make you want to achieve it even more. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It may be tempting to make your reward one of your favorite “forbidden foods” but we never suggest that you reward yourself this way.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You aren’t a dog. You should never reward “good behavior” with food. Having this mentality can create a really unhealthy relationship with food.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You need to eat healthy MOST of the time, control your portions, and see food as fuel. But if you are craving something that isn’t quite as healthy as your grilled chicken and rice, never feel like you need to lose 20 pounds to “deserve” a bite of cake, or nice dinner out with your family. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instead of rewarding yourself with food, buy yourself something you have been wanting. Maybe some new workout clothes, a massage, or an extra $20 bucks in your vacation fund! </span></p>

<p><b>TIP #7: Make Mental Health Top Priority</b></p>
<p><img class="size-large wp-image-7460" src="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_255894146.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_255894146.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_255894146.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_255894146.jpeg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_255894146.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_255894146.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Earlier, we mentioned that cold weather motivation dips may not be your fault.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’m sure you have heard of winter blues. Well, it’s a real thing. Less natural light can cause dips in serotonin, the neurotransmitter that regulates mood.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The dark and dreary days of winter can also cause your body to produce more of the sleep hormone melatonin. This shift can disrupt your body and impact your sleep patterns and overall mood.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are a few ways that you can focus on improving your mental health.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Invest in a light therapy box that simulates natural daylight.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Make sure you are supplementing with or eating plenty of foods with Vitamin D.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Start journaling. There is a lot of scientific evidence that supports putting your thoughts on paper provides a long list of benefits, including stress management, self-confidence, and goal setting. </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Suppose you still find yourself struggling with negative seasonal motivation shifts. In that case, you may need to experiment with taking</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> naturally sourced herbs</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to help support brain health and a positive mood.</span></p>
<p><b><i>Here are a few with some great scientific backing to help boost mood.</i></b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>EnXtra: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">A natural caffeine-free patent-pending botanical ingredient that has been shown to help increase dopamine levels.**It is also one of the first and only natural caffeine-free patent-pending botanical ingredients shown to boost mental alertness &amp; acuity for hours or ending in a huge caffeine energy crash.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Piper Nigrum Fruit Extract:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> A very specific type of black pepper that has been shown to help increase both serotonin and dopamine.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>L-Theanine:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> A powerful amino acid that is believed to help reduce occasional anxiety brought on by stressful situations.</span></li>
</ul>

<p><b><i>BOTTOM LINE IF YOU WANT TO STAY MOTIVATED YEAR ROUND</i></b><b><i><br />
</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you put away the shorts and swimsuits and shift out of bikini season, it’s common for motivation to “fall back” with the clocks. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The seasons have to change (unless you live near the equator) &#8211; so you have to figure out ways to</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">not let your fitness goals go into hibernation mode!</span><b><i> </i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pumpkin spice lattes are only here for a limited time, but getting into shape isn’t seasonal! </span><i>It&#8217;s a year-round commitment!!</i><i> </i></p>

<h2>Post-Workout Nutrition | Its Benefits to Overall Fitness and Health</h2>
<div id="how" class="anchor"></div>
<h3>How is Post-Workout Nutrition Beneficial to One&#8217;s Overall Fitness and Health?</h3>
<p>Post-workout nutrition is more important than many athletes realize. As important as <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/what-to-eat-before-workout/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pre-workout food</a> is, it is also crucial to turn your attention to what you eat after working out. Post-workout meal planning is essential to help you get the most benefit from your workout.</p>
<div id="why" class="anchor"></div>
<h3>Why is Eating the Right Post-Workout Food So Important?</h3>
<p><!-- instagram error: invalid instagram resource --></p>
<p>During your workout, your body begins the process of proteolysis, or the breaking down muscle proteins. That process intensifies during the three hours after your workout. The post-workout food choices that are best for you are ones that accomplish the following two things:</p>
<ol>
<li>Minimize the breakdown of muscles post-workout.</li>
<li>Stimulate protein synthesis to promote muscle growth.</li>
</ol>
<p>Protein eaten at any time is essential for promoting muscle growth. Protein consumed post-workout packs a little more power in that muscle-boosting punch.</p>
<p><strong>How much of a boost does it give?</strong></p>
<p>According to a study, post-workout infusions of amino acids yielded<span> </span><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9252488" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9252488">30 to 100 percent more protein synthesis</a><span> </span>than the same infusions administered while subjects were at rest.</p>
<p>That means that the right source of protein is essential post-workout food if you’re <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/how-to-gain-muscle-mass/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hoping to build muscle</a>, even if lean muscle production is your goal.</p>
<p><strong>What kinds of protein are best after working out?</strong></p>
<p>The beautiful thing about protein is that there are so many options for getting quality protein – even on the go. These are some of the foods to consider for your after workout meal:</p>
<ul>
<li>Greek yogurt</li>
<li>Eggs</li>
<li>Cottage cheese</li>
<li>Protein bars</li>
<li>Tuna</li>
<li>Salmon</li>
<li>Chicken</li>
</ul>
<p>You can even use animal or plant-based protein powders to make smoothies for a quick boost of nutrient-rich, protein-packed energy after working out.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://vshred.com/blog/high-protein-diet-plans/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">How much protein do you need</a> to consume after a workout?</strong></p>
<p>While the age old rule of thumb has been to consume a minimum of 20 grams of protein in after workout meals, modern wisdom shines new light on the subject.</p>
<p>This new information reveals that different people require different amounts of protein to optimize protein synthesis. Many experts now recommend between 40 and 50 grams of protein post-workout to achieve maximum protein synthesis.</p>
<div id="out" class="anchor"></div>
<h3>Carbohydrates After Working Out?</h3>
<p>With so much controversy over carbohydrates, it seems like this would be a taboo topic when it comes to effective post-workout foods. The truth is carbs help replenish depleted glycogen stores. Your body burns glycogen to fuel your workout. Carbs help to restore balance.</p>
<p>Not all workouts require as much help in restoring these depleted reserves. For instance, endurance sports and activities (running, swimming, cycling, etc.) need more compared to <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/strength-training/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">body building or resistance training</a>.</p>
<p>Note: It is more important for people who engage in exercise more frequently (such as twice in the same day without days of rest between workouts) than for people who workout more sporadically.</p>
<p>For those who require the replenishment of glycogen stores, however, the general rule of thumb is to follow a carb to protein ratio of 3:1. This indicates three grams of carbs for every one gram of protein. Consuming the right carbs and proteins together stimulates insulin secretion which promotes optimal glycogen synthesis.</p>
<p>Also, consume this carb to protein mixture within 30 minutes of training to achieve the proper synthesis of glycogen.</p>
<p>Among the best post-workout carbs to consider are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sweet potatoes</li>
<li>Chocolate milk</li>
<li>Fruits</li>
<li>Rice cakes</li>
<li>Oatmeal</li>
<li>Potatoes</li>
<li>Pasta</li>
<li>Leafy green vegetables (the darker varieties)</li>
<li>Rice</li>
</ul>
<p>These carbs are easily digestible and simple to prepare making them excellent choices for post-workout fuel.</p>
<div id="dont" class="anchor"></div>
<h3>Don’t Forget the Fats</h3>
<p><!-- instagram error: invalid instagram resource --></p>
<p>Fat is often maligned today. However, fat is an essential component of a healthy diet. The thing to remember is that there are good fats and bad fats. Healthy fats to include in a well-rounded post-workout meal plan include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Avocados</li>
<li>Nuts</li>
<li>Nut butters</li>
<li>Coconut oils</li>
<li>Fatty fish (like salmon)</li>
</ul>
<p>The key is moderation and discretion when consuming fats after working out and at any other time. Focusing on healthy fats allows you to enjoy the benefits without many of the risks associated with unhealthy varieties of fats.</p>
<div id="timing" class="anchor"></div>
<h3>Timing Your Post-Workout Meals</h3>
<p>Timing is everything when it comes to maximizing the impact of a good after workout meal. While some suggest eating within 30 minutes of working out, there are others who suggest you may have up to 45 minutes after you finish exercising to enjoy the benefits.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the sooner you begin restoring your body’s depleted stores, the better. That means that preparing meals ahead of time is your best bet or consider portable meals as part of your post-workout routine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Whether you’re looking to get fit or build serious muscle, the foods you eat after working out are just as important as those you eat before your workout for helping you accomplish your goals. This guide should help you identify the best foods to eat after a workout for the results you want.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Maintain a lean, healthy body by keeping track of your Thanksgiving calories this coming holiday season.</p>
<h2>Keeping Track of This Year’s Thanksgiving Calories</h2>
<h3>Food</h3>
<p><a href="https://vshred.com/blog/how-many-calories-should-i-eat-lose-weight/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Keeping track of the calories</a> you consume is important no matter what your fitness goal is. Here&#8217;s how much calories every Thanksgiving food item has.</p>
<h3>Turkey</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-5349 size-full" src="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Bs_4ce9_w0I-roasted-turkey-thanksgiving-calories-us.jpg?resize=625%2C400&#038;ssl=1" alt="Turkey | How To Size Out Your Thanksgiving Calories" width="625" height="400" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Bs_4ce9_w0I-roasted-turkey-thanksgiving-calories-us.jpg?w=625&amp;ssl=1 625w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Bs_4ce9_w0I-roasted-turkey-thanksgiving-calories-us.jpg?resize=300%2C192&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><strong>Serving size:</strong> 3 ounces (The size of a deck of cards)</p>
<p><strong>Calories:</strong> 132 (white meat)</p>
<p>How many calories are in a slice of Thanksgiving turkey? Well, the calories in turkey dinner with all the trimmings are around 132 per 3 ounces. Take note that this is for white meat turkey. Dark meat turkey is much tastier but has more fats and calories.</p>
<h3>Vegetables</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-5350 size-full" src="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/asian-food-bowl-close-up-cuisine-thanksgiving-calories-px.jpg?resize=625%2C400&#038;ssl=1" alt="Vegetables | How To Size Out Your Thanksgiving Calories" width="625" height="400" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/asian-food-bowl-close-up-cuisine-thanksgiving-calories-px.jpg?w=625&amp;ssl=1 625w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/asian-food-bowl-close-up-cuisine-thanksgiving-calories-px.jpg?resize=300%2C192&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><strong>Serving size:</strong> ½ cup (a rounded handful of chosen veggies)</p>
<p><strong>Calories:</strong> Varies</p>
<p>A half cup of vegetables is the palate cleanser you need to wash off all the fats and grease you’re consuming. Stick to green, leafy vegetable for fewer calories and more vitamins and minerals.</p>
<h3>Salad</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-5351 size-full" src="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/vegetable-salad-with-meat-strips-thanksgiving-calories-px.jpg?resize=625%2C400&#038;ssl=1" alt="Salad | How To Size Out Your Thanksgiving Calories" width="625" height="400" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/vegetable-salad-with-meat-strips-thanksgiving-calories-px.jpg?w=625&amp;ssl=1 625w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/vegetable-salad-with-meat-strips-thanksgiving-calories-px.jpg?resize=300%2C192&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><strong>Serving size:</strong> 1 cup (the size a baseball)</p>
<p><strong>Calories:</strong> 100-150 (depending on the dressing)</p>
<p>A cup of salad usually has around 100 to 150 calories. Keep in mind that most pre-packaged dressings are extremely high in calories.</p>
<p>To cut back on Thanksgiving calories, opt to use low-calorie cheese or vinaigrette instead of traditional dressings such as thousand island.</p>
<h3>Gravy</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-5352 size-full" src="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Close-up-of-Gravy-sauce-thanksgiving-calories-ss.jpg?resize=625%2C400&#038;ssl=1" alt="Gravy | How To Size Out Your Thanksgiving Calories" width="625" height="400" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Close-up-of-Gravy-sauce-thanksgiving-calories-ss.jpg?w=625&amp;ssl=1 625w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Close-up-of-Gravy-sauce-thanksgiving-calories-ss.jpg?resize=300%2C192&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><strong>Serving size:</strong> ¼ cup (the size of a golf ball)</p>
<p><strong>Calories:</strong> 30-50</p>
<p>Contrary to popular belief, gravy doesn’t contain that many calories. In fact, there are only around 30 to 50 calories in a ¼ cup of gravy.</p>
<p>Just make sure not to eat more than a cup to avoid consuming too much sodium.</p>
<h3>Cranberry Sauce</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-5353 size-full" src="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/roasted-fillet-of-turkey-with-cranberry-sauce-thanksgiving-calories-ss.jpg?resize=625%2C400&#038;ssl=1" alt="Cranberry Sauce | How To Size Out Your Thanksgiving Calories" width="625" height="400" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/roasted-fillet-of-turkey-with-cranberry-sauce-thanksgiving-calories-ss.jpg?w=625&amp;ssl=1 625w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/roasted-fillet-of-turkey-with-cranberry-sauce-thanksgiving-calories-ss.jpg?resize=300%2C192&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><strong>Serving size:</strong> ¼ cup (the size of a golf ball)</p>
<p><strong>Calories:</strong> 105</p>
<p>Cranberry sauce is another Thanksgiving favorite. However, when counting your Thanksgiving calories, keep in mind that cranberry sauce has more than double the amount of fat that gravy has.</p>
<h3>Stuffing</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-5354 size-full" src="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Homemade-Thanksgiving-Day-Stuffing-with-Sage-and-Celery-thanksgiving-calories-ss.jpg?resize=625%2C400&#038;ssl=1" alt="Stuffing | How To Size Out Your Thanksgiving Calories" width="625" height="400" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Homemade-Thanksgiving-Day-Stuffing-with-Sage-and-Celery-thanksgiving-calories-ss.jpg?w=625&amp;ssl=1 625w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Homemade-Thanksgiving-Day-Stuffing-with-Sage-and-Celery-thanksgiving-calories-ss.jpg?resize=300%2C192&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><strong>Serving size:</strong> ½ cup (the size of a standard ice cream scoop)</p>
<p><strong>Calories:</strong> 180</p>
<p>Try to keep your turkey stuffing down to less than half a cup. Going over that will just increase your Thanksgiving calories.</p>
<h3>Potatoes (Sweet or Mashed)</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-5355 size-full" src="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Mashed-potato-thanksgiving-calories-ss.jpg?resize=625%2C400&#038;ssl=1" alt="Potatoes (Sweet or Mashed) | How To Size Out Your Thanksgiving Calories" width="625" height="400" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Mashed-potato-thanksgiving-calories-ss.jpg?w=625&amp;ssl=1 625w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Mashed-potato-thanksgiving-calories-ss.jpg?resize=300%2C192&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><strong>Serving size:</strong> ½ cup (the size of half a tennis ball)</p>
<p><strong>Calories:</strong> 145</p>
<p>Sweet and mashed potatoes are a must at any Thanksgiving dinner. Luckily, you won’t consume too many carbs and calories if you only eat half a cup.</p>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> Don’t drown the potatoes in gravy. Doing so not only lessens the flavor, but it also adds unnecessary Thanksgiving calories.</p>
<h3>Cornbread (Without Butter)</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-5356 size-full" src="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Two-pieces-of-cornbread-on-a-white-plate-thanksgiving-calories-ss.jpg?resize=625%2C400&#038;ssl=1" alt="Cornbread (Without Butter) | How To Size Out Your Thanksgiving Calories" width="625" height="400" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Two-pieces-of-cornbread-on-a-white-plate-thanksgiving-calories-ss.jpg?w=625&amp;ssl=1 625w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Two-pieces-of-cornbread-on-a-white-plate-thanksgiving-calories-ss.jpg?resize=300%2C192&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><strong>Serving size:</strong> 1 medium muffin or square (the size of a bar of soap)</p>
<p><strong>Calories:</strong> 175</p>
<p>A serving of cornbread without butter has around 175 calories. It’s best to limit yourself to one piece of cornbread.</p>
<p>Think about it, this pastry has more calories than a serving of white meat turkey.</p>
<h3>Butter or Margarine</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-5357 size-full" src="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Piece-of-freshly-baked-cornbread-with-creamy-butter-on-top-thanksgiving-calories-ss.jpg?resize=625%2C400&#038;ssl=1" alt="Butter or Margarine | How To Size Out Your Thanksgiving Calories" width="625" height="400" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Piece-of-freshly-baked-cornbread-with-creamy-butter-on-top-thanksgiving-calories-ss.jpg?w=625&amp;ssl=1 625w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Piece-of-freshly-baked-cornbread-with-creamy-butter-on-top-thanksgiving-calories-ss.jpg?resize=300%2C192&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><strong>Serving size:</strong> 1 teaspoon (the size of a dice)</p>
<p><strong>Calories:</strong> 36</p>
<p>Adding a teaspoon of butter or margarine on your cornbread will lead to an extra 36 calories.</p>
<h3>Pie</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-5358 size-full" src="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/XQ5QWR8eZ5I-pumpkin-pie-thanksgiving-calories-us.jpg?resize=625%2C400&#038;ssl=1" alt="Pie | How To Size Out Your Thanksgiving Calories" width="625" height="400" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/XQ5QWR8eZ5I-pumpkin-pie-thanksgiving-calories-us.jpg?w=625&amp;ssl=1 625w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/XQ5QWR8eZ5I-pumpkin-pie-thanksgiving-calories-us.jpg?resize=300%2C192&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><strong>Serving size:</strong> ⅛ of a 9” pie (the size of a standard light bulb)</p>
<p><strong>Calories:</strong> 323 (pumpkin), 456 (pecan)</p>
<p>Thanksgiving day is the perfect opportunity for families to bust out their best pie recipe. However, if you want to cut back on the calories in your Thanksgiving dinner, stick to eating pumpkin pie.</p>
<p>But if you simply can’t resist the goodness of a pecan pie, just try to lessen the amount you’re eating.</p>
<h3>Drinks</h3>
<p>Let’s face it: no Thanksgiving dinner is complete without a few rounds of drinks. But keep in mind that alcoholic beverages add a ton to your Thanksgiving calories. Plus, they offer zero nutritional value.</p>
<p>However, Thanksgiving only comes once a year. So we can’t blame you for having a glass or two.</p>
<p>Overall, the best pick among these drinks is champagne. Meanwhile, try to steer clear of the sugary cocktail drinks and calorie-filled beer.</p>
<h3>White Wine</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-5359 size-full" src="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/6ciLddToTgM-white-wine-thanksgiving-calories-us.jpg?resize=625%2C400&#038;ssl=1" alt="White Wine | How To Size Out Your Thanksgiving Calories" width="625" height="400" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/6ciLddToTgM-white-wine-thanksgiving-calories-us.jpg?w=625&amp;ssl=1 625w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/6ciLddToTgM-white-wine-thanksgiving-calories-us.jpg?resize=300%2C192&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><strong>Calories:</strong> 121 per glass</p>
<p>White wine is a great alcoholic drink that helps lower cholesterol and balance your blood sugar. After all the food you ate, a glass of white wine may be the cleanser you need.</p>
<h3>Red Wine</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-5360 size-full" src="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Pouring-red-wine-from-bottle-into-the-wineglass-thanksgiving-calories-ss.jpg?resize=625%2C400&#038;ssl=1" alt="Red Wine | How To Size Out Your Thanksgiving Calories" width="625" height="400" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Pouring-red-wine-from-bottle-into-the-wineglass-thanksgiving-calories-ss.jpg?w=625&amp;ssl=1 625w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Pouring-red-wine-from-bottle-into-the-wineglass-thanksgiving-calories-ss.jpg?resize=300%2C192&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><strong>Calories:</strong> 127 per glass</p>
<p>While it does have 127 calories per glass, red wine contains plenty of antioxidants that are helpful to the body. You can opt to have a glass or two this Thanksgiving.</p>
<h3>Champagne</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-5361 size-full" src="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/champagne-pour-a-serve-thanksgiving-calories-pb.jpg?resize=625%2C400&#038;ssl=1" alt="Champagne | How To Size Out Your Thanksgiving Calories" width="625" height="400" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/champagne-pour-a-serve-thanksgiving-calories-pb.jpg?w=625&amp;ssl=1 625w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/champagne-pour-a-serve-thanksgiving-calories-pb.jpg?resize=300%2C192&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><strong>Calories</strong>: 78 per glass</p>
<p>Champagne drinks are very smooth and easy to drink. Plus, they only have 78 calories per glass. They&#8217;re the ideal alcoholic beverage to down this coming holiday season.</p>
<h3>Regular Beer</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-5362 size-full" src="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/alcoholic-beverage-bar-beer-drink-thanksgiving-calories-px.jpg?resize=625%2C400&#038;ssl=1" alt="Regular Beer | How To Size Out Your Thanksgiving Calories" width="625" height="400" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/alcoholic-beverage-bar-beer-drink-thanksgiving-calories-px.jpg?w=625&amp;ssl=1 625w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/alcoholic-beverage-bar-beer-drink-thanksgiving-calories-px.jpg?resize=300%2C192&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><strong>Calories:</strong> 150 per bottle</p>
<p>Many of us are too lazy to do anything other than pop open a bottle of beer. But if you want to stick to your fitness goals, it&#8217;s best to lay off the regular beer this Thanksgiving.</p>
<h3>Light Beer</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-5363 size-full" src="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Light-beer-mug-against-the-backdrop-of-the-bar-shelf-thanksgiving-calories-ss.jpg?resize=625%2C400&#038;ssl=1" alt="Light Beer | How To Size Out Your Thanksgiving Calories" width="625" height="400" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Light-beer-mug-against-the-backdrop-of-the-bar-shelf-thanksgiving-calories-ss.jpg?w=625&amp;ssl=1 625w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Light-beer-mug-against-the-backdrop-of-the-bar-shelf-thanksgiving-calories-ss.jpg?resize=300%2C192&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><strong>Calories:</strong> 95 per bottle</p>
<p>If you really don&#8217;t want to drink anything other than beer, don&#8217;t worry! Opt for light beer instead. It packs as much punch and flavor as regular beer minus the extra calories and carbs.</p>
<h3>Generic Cocktail</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-5364 size-full" src="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/eN6_2u8Pcrc-cocktail-thanksgiving-calories-us.jpg?resize=625%2C400&#038;ssl=1" alt="Generic Cocktail | How To Size Out Your Thanksgiving Calories" width="625" height="400" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/eN6_2u8Pcrc-cocktail-thanksgiving-calories-us.jpg?w=625&amp;ssl=1 625w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/eN6_2u8Pcrc-cocktail-thanksgiving-calories-us.jpg?resize=300%2C192&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><strong>Calories:</strong> 155 per glass</p>

<p>This is just a simple guide you can use to keep track of your Thanksgiving calories. Overall, whole grains, fruits, and vegetables should make up the biggest part of your meal.</p>
<p>Also, remember to do some <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/full-body-workout-for-weight-loss/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">full-body exercises</a> the day after Thanksgiving. It’ll help you sweat out the calories, cholesterol, and alcohol you consumed the night before.</p>

<p><strong>Calories:</strong> 300</p>
<p><strong>Cooking Time:</strong> 40 minutes</p>
<p>One popular way to eat healthily is to stick to a paleo diet. Many quick lunch recipes have paleo-friendly alternatives.</p>
<p>For example, instead of making a high-carb chicken sandwich, you can opt for a Chinese-style chicken salad. It’s high in fiber, protein, and minerals, which can help your body <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/pre-workout-meal-for-more-energy-quick-healthy-recipe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">maintain peak performance</a> both inside and outside the gym.</p>
<p>Plus, if you prepare the vinaigrette beforehand, it only takes 10 minutes to toss the ingredients together. It’s one of the best healthy lunch options for fitness buffs who want to start a paleo diet but don’t know much about cooking.</p>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> To make things easier, prepare about a week’s worth of chicken salad over the weekend, then store them in your refrigerator for later. Pack them cold so that they’re still fresh when lunchtime comes.</p>
<p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Salad</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>4 cups savoy cabbage, shredded</li>
<li>1 cup carrot, sliced</li>

<li>1/2 fresh lemon, juiced</li>
<li>1 tsp. fresh ginger, grated</li>
<li>2 tbsp. sesame oil</li>
<li>1 tsp. raw honey</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How to:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Toss the scallions, cabbage, carrots, and radish in a large bowl.</li>
<li>Top it with chicken, mint, and cilantro then set the salad aside so you can make the vinaigrette.</li>
<li>Remove the seeds from the chipotle pepper, place it in a small bowl, and then cover with warm water for 30 minutes.</li>

<h3>7. Broccoli and Chicken Thigh Recipe</h3>
<p><strong>Calories:</strong> 450</p>
<p><strong>Cooking Time:</strong> 30 minutes</p>
<p>When coming up with good lunch recipes, many fitness buffs dismiss chicken thighs and go straight for the breast. While breasts have fewer calories, the thighs contain more phosphorous, calcium, and potassium.</p>
<p>This broccoli and chicken thigh recipe is one of the best easy healthy lunches that utilize the thigh’s higher nutritional value. Plus, we&#8217;re not adding any unnecessary calories to the meal, since broccoli has few of them to begin with.</p>
<p>It’s a great alternative for gym-goers sick of eating easy healthy lunch recipes made of chicken breast. Cook a few meals in advance, then store them in the refrigerator for a quick and healthy paleo lunch on the go.</p>
<p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>12 boneless, skinless chicken thighs</li>
<li>2 cups broccoli florets</li>
<li>1 cup light chicken stock</li>
<li>2 tbsp. balsamic vinegar</li>
<li>1 tbsp. Dijon mustard</li>
<li>Salt</li>
<li>Pepper</li>
<li>1 tbsp. tapioca starch</li>
<li>2 tbsp. coconut oil</li>
<li>1 tsp. chili pepper flakes</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How to</strong>:</p>
<ol>
<li>Scrub the chicken with salt and pepper.</li>
<li>Place a large skillet pan over high heat then melt the coconut oil.</li>
<li>Cook the chicken for around eight minutes, flipping them about halfway through. Place the chicken on a plate then set aside.</li>
<li>Without removing the coconut oil and chicken juice, cook the broccoli over medium heat for around five minutes until they soften.</li>
<li>While waiting for the broccoli to soften, mix the vinegar, mustard, chicken stock, chili flakes. tapioca starch, and mustard in a large bowl.</li>
<li>Pour this over the broccoli then cook for another two minutes until it boils.</li>
<li>Throw in the chicken thighs in the saucepan and put some sauce over it.</li>
<li>Remove from heat then let it stand for five more minutes.</li>
<li>Serve and enjoy.</li>

<h2>Top Fat-Burning, Muscle-Building Diet Plans for Men</h2>
<h3><span style="color: #000080;">1. Custom Diet and Training Plan for Him by V Shred</span></h3>
<p><!-- instagram error: invalid instagram resource --></p>
<p>The <a href="https://vshred.com/programs/custom-training-and-diet-plan-8-week" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Custom Diet and Training Plan for Him</a> by V Shred offers an all-in-one solution for men who are trying to lose weight and build lean muscle. V Shred customizes the plan according to your individual needs.</p>
<p>How? We take into account your body type, fitness goals, and athleticism, among other factors, to create the best shredding program for men. It&#8217;s like having a personal trainer for less.</p>
<p><strong>Trivia</strong>: Do you know professional athletes, models, and actors pay for their fitness coaches around $10,000 monthly on average?</p>
<h3><span style="color: #000080;">2. Atkins Diet</span></h3>
<p>The Atkins Diet is a popular low-carb weight-loss program. The idea behind this fat-burner diet plan for men is that you should consume few to zero carbs while dieting. You get most of your energy from <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/high-protein-diet-plans/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">protein and healthy fats</a>.</p>
<p>However, remember that too much fat and protein may have negative effects on you if you’re prone to heart disease.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #000080;">3. Time-Restricted Intermittent Fasting</span></h3>
<p>Time-restricted intermittent fasting is a diet plan that restricts your calorie consumption for a specific period of time. Depending on the person, your fasting time can range anywhere from 4 to 12 hours.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that almost all calorie-cutting diet plans for men will make you lose at least a few pounds of muscle. Time-restricted intermittent fasting won&#8217;t help you build muscle fast but there are plenty of ways to still grow muscle during the process.</p>
<p>Scheduling your meals accordingly and continuous muscle-building workouts help counteract muscle reduction while on this diet.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #000080;">4. Low-Calorie Diet</span></h3>
<p><!-- instagram error: invalid instagram resource --></p>
<p>This diet meal plan decreases the number of calories you consume in a day. The average man&#8217;s calorie consumption goes down from 2,000-2,500 calories per day to 800-1,200 calories.</p>
<p>When on this diet, make sure you still consume enough protein to support muscle growth. Around one gram of protein per pound of body weight is enough to keep your muscles from shrinking despite low-calorie intake.</p>
<p>Some examples of food that are good for this diet are tomatoes, celery, carrots, apples, and nuts. Add some beef, chicken breast, and eggs for your protein intake.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #000080;">5. Paleo Diet</span></h3>
<p>Plenty of people blame junk foods and fast food restaurants for obesity because of all the chemicals and additives in their products. Fitness buffs who want to lessen their consumption of additives and chemicals created the Paleo diet.</p>
<p>The theory behind this is to only eat foods you would get by hunting or fishing, just like our forefathers did in the Paleolithic era. It’s one of the simplest and most affordable diet plans for men on this list.</p>
<p>Consuming these food types allows you to get the nutrients you need to grow your muscles minus the unnecessary calories.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #000080;">6. The 5:2 Diet</span></h3>
<p>The 5:2 diet is currently the most popular subcategory of intermittent fasting. Instead of fasting for hours, here, you fast for days. You should only use this diet plan if you want to lose fat fast.</p>
<p>While it may not be able to sustain muscle growth, you can still offset your muscle-loss by doing specific exercises. For example, you can avoid cardio workouts and focus on heavy muscle-building workouts.</p>
<p><strong>Pro tips:</strong> Remember that you should not do this type of fasting for more than a few months. We strongly recommend consulting with your physician before deciding to try this type of diet plan for men.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #000080;">7. The Zone Diet</span></h3>
<p>The Zone Diet is basically a balanced program consisting of carbs, protein, fats, and other nutrients. Everything is fair game provided they are consumed in moderation.</p>
<p>This is great for weight loss because unlike other diet plans for men, the Zone Diet is a bit more flexible. You can freely add in the macros you need to promote muscle growth.</p>
<p>Remember: the key to sustaining muscle development despite trying to lose weight is to consume the right nutrients.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Check out the top three lies about diet plans for men:</strong></p>

<p>When trying out diet plans for men, it’s always best to consult with your physician first. Try to avoid certain meal plans that may have adverse effects on you.</p>
<p>That’s why it’s always best to go with a customized <a href="https://vshred.com/programs/custom-training-and-diet-plan-8-week" target="_blank" rel="noopener">meal plan</a> tailored to suit your needs, goals, and current level of athleticism. At the end of the day, the important thing is to create a healthy balance <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/why-not-losing-weight/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">between exercise</a>, diet, and supplementation.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Why do you need to learn how to meal prep? Meal prepping is the simple act of preparing a meal to be able to use for a later time. It is also a beneficial way to maintain portion control and stick to dietary restrictions.</p>
<p>Many people do small forms of meal planning and meal prepping such as making their lunches ahead for work. Yet, true meal prepping involves preparing your meals for anywhere from three to seven days at one time.</p>

<h3><strong>The Benefits of Meal Prepping</strong></h3>
<p><!-- instagram error: invalid instagram resource --></p>
<p>There are many benefits to learning how to meal prep both for your wallet and for your health. Some of the best benefits of meal prepping include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Staying on your dietary routine</strong> &#8211; Whether you follow nutrition goals for muscle growth, weight loss, or portion control-related to health concerns, meal preparing can make it easier to stay on track and reduce the temptation.</li>
<li><strong>Reducing the amount of preparation</strong> &#8211; While the initial prep of your weekly meals may seem like a significant amount of time, you are saving hours by not having to plan and prep your meals each night. You will also likely reduce emergency trips to the store for missing ingredients.</li>
<li><strong>Staying on a budget</strong> &#8211; When you plan your meals in advance you will be less tempted to buy things you don&#8217;t need or will not use throughout the week. Additionally, you will be able to take advantage of bulk purchasing and buying larger quantities of items when they are on sale.</li>
</ul>
<div id="Foods" class="anchor"></div>
<h3><strong>What Foods Are Best for Meal Prep?</strong></h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-3518 size-full" src="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Healthy-meal-prep-containers-with-chickpeas-goose-meat-tomatoes-avocado-lemon-and-spinach.-Top-view-how-to-meal-prep-ss.jpg?resize=625%2C400&#038;ssl=1" alt="What Do You Need to Start? | How To Meal Prep | A Beginner's Guide To Meal Prepping | meal prepping" width="625" height="400" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Healthy-meal-prep-containers-with-chickpeas-goose-meat-tomatoes-avocado-lemon-and-spinach.-Top-view-how-to-meal-prep-ss.jpg?w=625&amp;ssl=1 625w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Healthy-meal-prep-containers-with-chickpeas-goose-meat-tomatoes-avocado-lemon-and-spinach.-Top-view-how-to-meal-prep-ss.jpg?resize=300%2C192&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>Meal preparation is almost no different than storing leftovers. So a good rule of thumb is, if you won&#8217;t keep it as a leftover, it might not be the best for meal prep.</p>
<p>That being said there are definitely foods that are <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/easy-healthy-dinner-ideas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">better choices for meal preparation</a>. Some of the best choices include:</p>
<p>1. Grains</p>
<p>2. Pasta</p>
<p>3. Beans</p>
<p>4. Meat</p>
<p>5. Roasted vegetables</p>
<p>6. Hearty raw vegetables such as carrots, peas, and peppers</p>
<p>7. Whole fruits such as apples and oranges</p>
<p>8. Nuts</p>
<p>9. Cheese</p>
<p>10. Sauces such as salad dressings and sour cream</p>
<p>11. Dips such as hummus and salsa</p>
<p>Foods that do not last so well for meal preparation include soft or cut fruits and vegetables and foods that are supposed to be crunchy such as crackers and chips. There are some option to include these items such as individual packaging.</p>
<div id="Start" class="anchor"></div>
<h3><strong>What Do You Need to Start?</strong></h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-3519 size-full" src="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/How-To-Meal-Prep-A-Beginners-Guide-To-Meal-Prepping-how-to-meal-prep-ss.jpg?resize=625%2C400&#038;ssl=1" alt="What Do You Need to Start? | How To Meal Prep | A Beginner's Guide To Meal Prepping | meal planning" width="625" height="400" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/How-To-Meal-Prep-A-Beginners-Guide-To-Meal-Prepping-how-to-meal-prep-ss.jpg?w=625&amp;ssl=1 625w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/How-To-Meal-Prep-A-Beginners-Guide-To-Meal-Prepping-how-to-meal-prep-ss.jpg?resize=300%2C192&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>Before learning how to meal prep, you will need to gather the items necessary to make your prep as easy and efficient as possible.</p>
<p>To make prepping most effective, the primary items you will need are containers. The best types of containers are ones that are dishwasher and microwave safe and are able to go into the freezer. You also want to make sure that you get the containers in a variety of sizes.</p>
<p>Consider investing in some high quality separated containers to keep a whole meal in one place. Buy multiple sizes of resealable bags for ingredients that need to be separated out.</p>
<p>Once you have gathered your needed containers, you will want to get together items you will need to cook your meals. Gather baking dishes, pots and pans, and even crock pots and steamers to be able to get as many items preparing as you can.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>Getting Started</strong></h3>
<p><!-- instagram error: invalid instagram resource --></p>
<p>There are a few steps you need to take to begin prepping like a pro. It is important to remember that proper planning is the key to successful meal preparation.</p>
<h3>Pick Your Prep Method</h3>
<p>Determining your prep method will largely depend on what the goals of your meal preparation are. There are four primary prep methods to choose from including:</p>
<p><strong>1. Make-ahead meals</strong> &#8211; These meals are completely cooked before they are stored and then reheated when it is time to eat. This is a good option for those who want to keep to a diet or have home-cooked meals with little preparation.</p>
<p><strong>2. Batch cooking and freeze storing</strong> &#8211; In this method, batches of food are cooked. Then they are portioned out and frozen to be used for meals later. This is a good option for recipes that are easy to make larger and ones that reheat well.</p>
<p><strong>3. Pre-portioned meals</strong> &#8211; This is the best option for those with a strict diet or specified nutrient needs. When you prepare this way, you will be creating grab and go meals that take the guesswork out of portioning and calorie counting.</p>
<h3>Create Your Meal Plan</h3>
<p>After determining your prep type, you will need to create your menu and create a meal plan.</p>
<p>1. Decide which meals you want to prep.</p>
<p>2. Determine your menu, making sure to plan your meals around seasonal options.</p>
<p>3. Schedule your designated prep time making sure you will have plenty of time to get everything done uninterrupted.</p>
<h3>Get Shopping</h3>
<p>Once your menu is planned, it is time to get the ingredients you will need for your meal prep. Make sure that your kitchen is stocked with most of the staples that the recipes call for including spices and other seasonings.</p>
<p>Next, you will want to create a detailed grocery list, organizing it by grocery department. This will not only reduce the amount of time you have to spend in the store but also help you remember everything you need.</p>
<h3>Begin Prepping and Storing</h3>
<p>Now that you have everything ready to go, it is time to get cooking. Cooking your meals will largely depend on what recipes you use, but always look for ways to be effective such as baking two dishes that cook at the same temperature together.</p>
<div id="Prepping" class="anchor"></div>
<h3><strong>Meal Prepping Tips</strong></h3>
<p><!-- instagram error: invalid instagram resource --></p>
<p>To get the most out of your meal prep follow the few easy tips below.</p>
<p><strong>1. Use your time wisely</strong> &#8211; Try to plan your time as efficiently as possible making sure to start cooking items that will take the longest. For recipes that call for the same ingredients, prep those meals at the same time, dividing the ingredients as you need. You can also save time cleaning your cutting board by cutting all of your raw meats first.</p>
<p><strong>2. Keep storage life in mind</strong> &#8211; You don&#8217;t want all of your hard work to be for nothing. Make sure that you know the prep methods to keep items as long as possible and only prep out as long as the ingredients will stay fresh.</p>
<p><strong>3. Freeze properly</strong> &#8211; Freezing can be a great way to get ahead on meals and make sure they stay fresh longer. Making sure your foods are properly prepped and packaged to freeze properly is important. For example, you should always leave an inch on top of containers or bags for foods to expand while they freeze. Also, make sure to properly label and date everything, so you never wonder how old or what something is.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Knowing the best times to eat carbs is essential to any weight goal. Whether you’re on a bulking or cutting diet, your body needs carbs almost every day. If you’re carb cycling, you should not go longer than 2-3 days without carbs. Find out when to eat carbs and when you shouldn’t.</p>
<h2>When Are the Best Times to Eat Carbs?</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>Why Do You Need Carbs?</strong></h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-3395 size-full" src="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Why-do-You-Need-Carbs-best-times-to-eat-carbs-px.jpg?resize=625%2C400&#038;ssl=1" alt="Why do You Need Carbs? | BEST Times To Eat Carbs (STOP SKIPPING NUMBER 3!) | When to eat carbs" width="625" height="400" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Why-do-You-Need-Carbs-best-times-to-eat-carbs-px.jpg?w=625&amp;ssl=1 625w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Why-do-You-Need-Carbs-best-times-to-eat-carbs-px.jpg?resize=300%2C192&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px" data-recalc-dims="1" /><br />
Carbohydrates are one of the four essential macronutrients. Your whole body needs carbs because they are your body’s primary source of energy. Some diets ban the consumption of carbs with the promise of a <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/how-to-get-a-flat-stomach/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">flatter stomach</a>. But if there aren’t enough carbs in your body, it may start to shut down and cause unwanted results, like:</p>
<ul>
<li>lack of energy</li>
<li>hormone imbalance</li>
<li>slower metabolism</li>
<li>constipation</li>
<li>slower brain activity</li>
<li>increased sugar cravings</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>3 Best Times to Eat Carbs</strong></h3>
<p><!-- instagram error: invalid instagram resource --></p>
<h3>1.Early in the Day</h3>
<p>Eat carbs during your first meal of the day so that it can be used to fuel your body as you start your day. It’ll also help you deal with the stressors of the day.</p>
<p>Carbs can help your mind stay sharp throughout the day because it also fuels your nervous system. The brain uses up the most energy in your body because it&#8217;s filled with nerves and neurons. The glucose in the carbs act as its energy source and helps the brain work more efficiently.</p>
<h3>2. Pre-Workout</h3>
<p>Don’t eat right before you go to the gym because your body needs time to digest the food before you start your workout. Instead, eat 1-3 hours before your next gym session.</p>
<p>Eating carbs before a workout will fuel your body with calories, glycogen for your muscles, and glucose for the brain. This will help you perform longer and more effectively at the gym.</p>
<h3>3. Post-Workout</h3>
<p>Having carbs <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/what-eat-after-workout/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">after your workout</a> may be the best time to eat carbs if you didn’t eat any earlier. Your workout would have depleted your glycogen stores and your next carb intake will help your muscles recover.</p>
<p>Not eating carbs after the gym can lessen the effectiveness of your workout because your body won&#8217;t recover as efficiently. The carbs can also help boost your protein intake and muscle growth.</p>
<h3><strong>The Worst Time to Eat Carbs</strong></h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-3396 size-full" src="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/The-Worst-Time-to-Eat-Carbs-best-times-to-eat-carbs-px.jpg?resize=625%2C400&#038;ssl=1" alt="The Worst Time to Eat Carbs | BEST Times To Eat Carbs (STOP SKIPPING NUMBER 3!) | cutting diet" width="625" height="400" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/The-Worst-Time-to-Eat-Carbs-best-times-to-eat-carbs-px.jpg?w=625&amp;ssl=1 625w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/The-Worst-Time-to-Eat-Carbs-best-times-to-eat-carbs-px.jpg?resize=300%2C192&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px" data-recalc-dims="1" /><br />
While you’re asleep, your body will release growth hormones. These hormones affect your aging hormones, cortisol levels, and serotonin levels. But eating carbs right before bed will inhibit the production of these growth hormones and you will wake up feeling sluggish. At the same time, these carbs won’t be used as fuel and will be stored as fat.</p>

<h2>7-Day Meal Plan to Lose Weight</h2>
<div id="1" class="anchor"></div>
<h3><strong>Day 1</strong></h3>
<h3><span style="color: #000080;">1. Breakfast | Oatmeal with Fruit</span></h3>
<p>For breakfast, you can switch between a bowl of hot or cold oatmeal with some fresh fruit on the side. Hot oatmeal takes a longer time to digest, which will help keep you full a little longer.</p>
<p>Add a couple of tablespoons of Greek yogurt to amp up your protein intake.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #000080;">2. Morning Snack | Fruits</span></h3>
<p>If you&#8217;re hungry a few hours before lunchtime, you can <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/good-healthy-snacks-to-have-late-at-night/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">snack on</a> some fruits to satiate some of that hunger. Try two tangerines or an apple with a handful of nuts, dried apricots, or raisins to get you going.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #000080;">3. Lunch | Veggie</span></h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-2542 size-full" src="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/salad-fresh-veggies-vegetables-meal-plan-to-lose-weight-pb.jpg?resize=625%2C417&#038;ssl=1" alt="Lunch | Veggie | Follow This Fat Shedding Meal Plan To Lose Weight | 7-day diet meal plan" width="625" height="417" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/salad-fresh-veggies-vegetables-meal-plan-to-lose-weight-pb.jpg?w=625&amp;ssl=1 625w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/salad-fresh-veggies-vegetables-meal-plan-to-lose-weight-pb.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>Take two cups of soup filled with a mix of vegetables. Boil some chopped spinach and escarole in chicken to make a hearty veggie soup for lunch.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #000080;">4. Afternoon Snack | Carrots and Hummus</span></h3>
<p>Chop some carrot sticks and put some protein-packed hummus dip in a container for a quick snack in the afternoon. This perfect combination of protein, carbohydrates, and fats will help keep you going until dinner time.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #000080;">5. Dinner | Teriyaki Salmon and Veggies</span></h3>
<p>Bake 100 g of salmon at 400 degrees Fahrenheit for 10-15 minutes until it&#8217;s firm. Then steam chopped carrots and broccoli for 3-5 minutes.</p>
<p>Pour some teriyaki sauce over them and finish off with some sesame seeds.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #000080;">6. Dessert | Berries</span></h3>
<p>After dinner, if you&#8217;re still hungry, enjoy some light and sweet dessert. Snack on some blueberries, raspberries, or strawberries before you start getting ready for bed.</p>
<div id="2" class="anchor"></div>
<h3><strong>Day 2</strong></h3>
<h3><span style="color: #000080;">7. Breakfast | Berry Smoothie</span></h3>
<p>Start your day with a berry smoothie filled with fructose and protein. In a blender, mix a chopped banana, half a cup of strawberries, half a cup of nonfat milk, and half a cup of plain Greek yogurt.</p>
<p>You may also add some protein powder to turn this into a <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/healthy-protein-shake-recipes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">protein smoothie</a>.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #000080;">8. Morning Snack | Grapes or Nuts</span></h3>
<p>As a morning snack, keep yourself full with some 30 g of nuts or a handful of grapes. You can also have some strawberries left over from your berry smoothie.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #000080;">9. Lunch | Turkey Sandwich</span></h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-2540 size-full" src="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/bread-bun-cutlery-delicious-meal-plan-to-lose-weight-px.jpg?resize=625%2C417&#038;ssl=1" alt="Lunch | Turkey Sandwich | Follow This Fat Shedding Meal Plan To Lose Weight | simple meal plan to lose weight" width="625" height="417" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/bread-bun-cutlery-delicious-meal-plan-to-lose-weight-px.jpg?w=625&amp;ssl=1 625w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/bread-bun-cutlery-delicious-meal-plan-to-lose-weight-px.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>Make a sandwich with sliced roasted turkey breast, sliced tomatoes, and some baby greens with two slices of whole grain bread. Choose a bread that&#8217;s low in sodium to prevent water retention.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #000080;">10. Afternoon Snack | Pear and Popcorn</span></h3>
<p>If your turkey sandwich wasn&#8217;t enough, you can eat some air-popped popcorn and a pear. The popcorn will help satisfy your potato chip cravings while the pear will help satiate you.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #000080;">11. Dinner | Grilled Chicken and Veggies</span></h3>
<p>Grill 100 g of chicken, and roast a cup of Brussels sprouts and half a cup of sweet potatoes. Season the chicken and the vegetables with olive oil, pepper, and salt.</p>

<p>Blend your leftover berries with some vanilla extract and silken tofu until it is smooth.</p>
<div id="3" class="anchor"></div>
<h3><strong>Day 3</strong></h3>
<h3><span style="color: #000080;">13. Breakfast | Egg White Omelet</span></h3>
<p>Separate three egg whites from the yolks and mix it in a bowl with a fork. Pour the egg white mixture into a heated pan and top it off with grilled onions, mushrooms, and bell peppers.</p>
<p>Then add some ricotta cheese before you fold the omelet.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #000080;">14. Morning Snack | Watermelon</span></h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-2544 size-full" src="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/melon-fresh-juice-watermelon-juice-meal-plan-to-lose-weight-pb.jpg?resize=625%2C423&#038;ssl=1" alt="Morning Snack | Watermelon | Follow This Fat Shedding Meal Plan To Lose Weight | healthy diet" width="625" height="423" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/melon-fresh-juice-watermelon-juice-meal-plan-to-lose-weight-pb.jpg?w=625&amp;ssl=1 625w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/melon-fresh-juice-watermelon-juice-meal-plan-to-lose-weight-pb.jpg?resize=300%2C203&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>Have a cup of diced watermelon in the morning if you&#8217;re feeling hungry. For mornings when you need to rush off, grab a tall cup of watermelon smoothie with a scoop of vanilla protein powder to go.</p>
<p>If watermelons aren&#8217;t available, you can substitute this with another seasonal fruit.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #000080;">15. Lunch | Tuna Salad</span></h3>
<p>Mix 76 g of cooked tuna with 2 cups of mixed greens, half a cup of chopped cucumbers, and half a cup of cherry tomatoes. Then season the tuna salad with a tablespoon of vinaigrette.</p>

<h3><span style="color: #000080;">18. Dessert | Frozen Yogurt</span></h3>

<p>After a couple of low-calorie meals throughout the day, you deserve some steak. Eat 100 g of lean steak with roasted sweet potatoes and Brussel sprouts to fill you up.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #000080;">30. Dessert | Berry Mousse</span></h3>

<h3><span style="color: #000080;">32. Morning Snack | Fruits</span></h3>
<p>Have some fresh fruits with some dried apricot or a cup of Greek yogurt in the morning if you&#8217;re hungry. Try to avoid pre-prepared mixed fruits with added sugar.</p>

<div id="7" class="anchor"></div>
<h3><strong>Day 7</strong></h3>
<h3><span style="color: #000080;">37. Breakfast |  Overnight Oats</span></h3>

<h3><span style="color: #000080;">38. Morning Snack | Nuts and Banana</span></h3>
<p>Have a banana in the morning if your oats weren&#8217;t enough to fuel you until lunchtime. To extend your energy a little longer, nuts prove to be very helpful.</p>

<p>Instead of using turkey breast, wrap 75 g of smoked salmon in a whole wheat tortilla wrap. Don&#8217;t&#8217; forget to spread some avocado on the wrap and squeeze in some mixed greens to make this tasty and healthy lunch!</p>
<h3><span style="color: #000080;">40. Afternoon Snack | Carrots and Hummus</span></h3>
<p>Slice a carrot into small sticks and carry them in a container with some hummus. Enjoy this delicious and healthy snack anywhere.</p>
<p>You may also substitute the carrot with some snap peas.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #000080;">41. Dinner | Veggie Pizza</span></h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-4895 size-full" src="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/cheese-close-up-cooking-Meal-Plan-To-Lose-Weight.jpg?resize=625%2C375&#038;ssl=1" alt="Dinner | Veggie Pizza | Follow This Fat Shedding Meal Plan To Lose Weight" width="625" height="375" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/cheese-close-up-cooking-Meal-Plan-To-Lose-Weight.jpg?w=625&amp;ssl=1 625w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/cheese-close-up-cooking-Meal-Plan-To-Lose-Weight.jpg?resize=300%2C180&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>After a week of healthy eating, it&#8217;s time for a simple cheat meal. Have two slices of veggie pizza and a green salad on the side.</p>
<p>Try using lentil flour when making your pizza crust to pack some proteins into your cheat treat. Instead of having dessert, have a glass of wine to go with your dinner.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Those are just some of the questions that may be running through your head.</p>

<h3>Body Types</h3>
<p><!-- instagram error: invalid instagram resource --></p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the truth — there is no right or wrong answer. The best diet varies based on your body type.</p>
<p>Ultimately, you shouldn&#8217;t choose a one-size-fits-all diet. For best results, you need a diet plan that works with your body type, weight loss goals, and lifestyle.</p>
<div id="Three" class="anchor"></div>
<h3>The Three Body Types</h3>
<p>For sustainable long-term weight loss, the best approach is to figure out your body type and choose your diet accordingly. There are three main body types.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ectomorphs</strong> — Featuring small bone structures, ectomorphs tend to be &#8220;naturally&#8221; thin with fast metabolisms. They also tend to have small chests and buttocks, with a straight, almost ruler-like shape. They may be hyperactive and sometimes have difficulty gaining weight or muscle mass. Think Calista Flockhart, Kate Moss, Audrey Hepburn, or Matthew McConaughey.</li>
<li><strong>Mesomorphs</strong> — Boasting a medium bone structure, mesomorphs tend to be athletic and lean. They also tend to have higher levels of testosterone and growth hormones, which allow them to develop muscle easily.</li>
<li>Male mesomorphs tend to be wider at the shoulders than the hips, and women often have an hourglass shape. Famous people with mesomorphic qualities include Angela Bassett, Madonna, George Clooney, and Bruce Willis.</li>
<li><strong>Endomorphs</strong> — The total opposite of ectomorphs, endomorphs have a larger frame with a soft and curvy body. They tend to be pear-shaped, with wider hips than shoulders. Since they have sluggish metabolisms, they need to work hard to lose extra fat they gain. On the other hand, they boast some serious muscle when they get control of their physique. Some examples of celebrities with endomorph bodies are Roseanne Barr and Jonah Hill, but also curvy frames like Marilyn Monroe and J Lo, and last but not least &#8211; athletes such as most NFL linemen.</li>
</ul>
<p>Keep in mind these body types may have some overlap, and they can be confused with each other. For instance, an endomorph who has spent a lot of time weightlifting and working out may look like a naturally muscular mesomorph.</p>
<p>Similarly, if an ectomorph has a very sedentary lifestyle, they can put on weight and end up looking like an endomorph. Often, you can tell the difference because ectomorphs tend to have relatively thin limbs, even if they have put weight on around the middle of their bodies.</p>
<div id="ectomorphs" class="anchor"></div>
<h3>Ectomorphs Best Diets</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-2290 size-full" src="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/chicken-broccoli-vegetable-protein-carbs-diet-plans-for-weight-loss-us.jpg?resize=625%2C469&#038;ssl=1" alt="Best Diets for Ectomorphs | Diet Plans For Weight Loss | How To Choose The Right One For Your Body | meal plan" width="625" height="469" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/chicken-broccoli-vegetable-protein-carbs-diet-plans-for-weight-loss-us.jpg?w=625&amp;ssl=1 625w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/chicken-broccoli-vegetable-protein-carbs-diet-plans-for-weight-loss-us.jpg?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>Due to their high metabolism, ectomorphs tend to have a high tolerance for carbohydrates. In fact, you need a lot of carbs to make up the calories you&#8217;re likely burning with your high activity levels.</p>
<p>The best diet for this body type is a low-fat diet featuring moderate levels of protein.</p>
<p>As a guideline, your calories should come 55% from carbs, 25% from protein, and 20% from fat. A sample meal that meets those proportions includes a portion of meat about the size of your palm, a fist-sized vegetable serving, two handfuls of dense carbs, and fat that&#8217;s about half your thumb.</p>
<p>For instance, a chicken breast, a small scoop of vegetables, a cup of rice, and a pat of butter meets these criteria. Note the exact portions vary based on your body weight and your weight loss goals.</p>
<div id="mesomorphs" class="anchor"></div>
<h3>Mesomorph Best Diet</h3>
<p>Mesomorphs thrive with a balanced diet. Shoot for 45% carbs, 25% protein, and 30% fat.</p>
<p>On the plate, this ideal meal looks like a palm-sized serving of protein, a fist-sized scoop of vegetables, a cupped handful of carbs, and about a thumb worth of dense fats. That&#8217;s essentially the equivalent of a four-ounce piece of lean steak, a serving of your favorite vegetables, a half cup of quinoa, and a pat of butter.</p>
<p>Again, remember that the exact portions vary based on your body size.</p>
<div id="endomorphs" class="anchor"></div>
<h3>Endomorph Best Diets</h3>
<p>Endomorphs tend to be naturally less active, and they have a very limited tolerance for carbohydrates. If you&#8217;re an endomorph, you should focus on a low-carb diet with high levels of protein and fat.</p>
<p>Ideally, you should get about 25% of your calories from carbs, 25% from proteins, and 45% from fat, and you may benefit from something like carb cycling.</p>
<p>To get these foods in your diet, your meal should include a palm-sized serving of lean protein, a fist full of vegetables, just half a handful of carbs, and two thumb-size servings of fat. Imagine a moderate size chicken breast, an average size serving of corn, brown rice that&#8217;s about half the size of your vegetable serving, and about 20 fat-rich nuts on the side.</p>
<div id="tolerance" class="anchor"></div>
<h3>Carbohydrate Tolerance</h3>
<p>In addition to thinking about body type, you should think about your carb tolerance. Your body type tends to dictate your carbohydrate tolerance, but your ability to tolerate carbs is also directly connected to your activity levels. In other words, the more active you are, the more carbs your diet can tolerate.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>High Carb Tolerance</strong> — If your carb tolerance is high, you can eat carbs on a regular basis. To make sure your body has the fuel it needs, you may want to up your carb intake around workouts, but remember that when you increase carbs, you often lower fat and protein intake. If you&#8217;re trying to build muscle, you may need to increase your protein intake as well, especially if you have an ectomorphic body type.</li>
<li><strong>Moderate Carb Tolerance</strong> — This tolerance level is often associated with the mesomorph body type. You should only eat a lot of carbs around workouts, but otherwise, only eat a moderate amount of carbs and focus on lean protein, fruits, and vegetables.</li>
<li><strong>Low Carb Tolerance</strong> — If your carb tolerance is low, you should only have carbs if you&#8217;re working out and ideally near your workout times. If you&#8217;re trying to lose weight, you may want to cut out most carbs and embrace a low-carb diet with lots of fruits, vegetables, protein, and some fat.</li>
</ul>
<div id="considerations" class="anchor"></div>
<h3>Carbohydrate Considerations</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-2275 size-full" src="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/fiber-carbs-rich-foods-on-wooden-Diet-Plans-For-Weight-Loss-ss.jpg?resize=625%2C415&#038;ssl=1" alt="Carbohydrate Considerations | Diet Plans For Weight Loss | How To Choose The Right One For Your Body | lose weight" width="625" height="415" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/fiber-carbs-rich-foods-on-wooden-Diet-Plans-For-Weight-Loss-ss.jpg?w=625&amp;ssl=1 625w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/fiber-carbs-rich-foods-on-wooden-Diet-Plans-For-Weight-Loss-ss.jpg?resize=300%2C199&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>The healthiest carbohydrates feature complex whole grains, and they include rice, quinoa, millet, corn, and barley. Many vegetables and even fruits are also carb-rich, such as yams, sweet potatoes, and bananas.</p>
<p>When creating a meal plan for yourself, try to focus on healthy carbs rather than refined sugar or white flour.</p>
<p>Also, remember that the sugars in fruit aren&#8217;t necessarily healthy and try to strike the right ratio between your fruits and vegetables. As a general rule of thumb, you may want to focus on the following fruit and vegetable ratios based on your body type and car tolerance:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ectomorph / High Carb Tolerance</strong>: Three vegetable servings to one fruit serving</li>
<li><strong>Mesomorphs / Moderate Carb Tolerance</strong>: Four vegetable servings to one fruit serving</li>
<li><strong>Endomorph / Low Carb Tolerance</strong>: Five vegetables to one fruit serving</li>
</ul>
<div id="personal" class="anchor"></div>
<h3>Personal Preferences</h3>
<p>When you&#8217;re looking at <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/best-diets-weight-loss/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">diet plans for weight loss</a>, you also need to think about your personal preferences and your lifestyle. To explain, imagine that a high protein diet works best for your body type, but you&#8217;re a vegan.</p>
<p>In this situation, you can&#8217;t choose a paleo diet. Instead, you need a diet where the protein comes from plants.</p>
<p>Similarly, if you have a hard time denying yourself certain foods, you may need to avoid overly strict diets. Sometimes, when people cheat they feel like hope is lost, and they quit trying.</p>
<p>If you know this is a risk, you may want to pick a diet that focused on balance and doesn&#8217;t put any foods off limits. Then, if you need a small dessert or a snack once in a while, that&#8217;s fine.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also easier to stick to a meal plan if it appeals to you. If your diet doesn&#8217;t contain foods that you like and enjoy, sticking with it can become overwhelming.</p>
<p>Note, however, you should be open to trying new things. Rather than focusing on what you can&#8217;t eat, get excited about the new foods you haven&#8217;t gotten to try yet.</p>
<div id="Other" class="anchor"></div>
<h3>Other Weight Loss Plans to Consider</h3>
<p>As you choose a weight loss plan, other factors to consider include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ethical or religious dietary restrictions</li>
<li>Health conditions such as high blood pressure, diabetes, or other issues</li>
<li>Allergies or intolerances to certain foods</li>
<li>Your gender</li>
<li>Your budget</li>
<li>Weight loss goals</li>
</ul>
<div id="previous" class="anchor"></div>
<h3>Previous Experiences</h3>
<p>As you choose a diet plan, you may want to think about diets you&#8217;ve tried in the past. Think about how they made you feel and whether or not they helped you achieve long-term weight loss.</p>
<p>If a certain diet made you feel sluggish, it probably didn&#8217;t complement your body type. That&#8217;s a sign you need to try something else.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you plan on getting cut and lean, you should start thinking about high protein diet plans. Every part of your body uses protein to grow and function, and if you don&#8217;t get enough protein, your body can suffer. High protein diet plans can help you with weight loss, stabilize your blood sugar levels, boost your metabolism, and improve your energy. If you&#8217;re thinking about starting a high-protein diet, keep these tips in mind.</p>
<h2>High Protein Diet Plans You Should Look Into to Get Cut</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span style="color: #000080;">1. Avoid a Lack of Protein</span></h3>
<p>A lack of protein can wreak havoc on your body in a number of ways. In particular, if you&#8217;re on a low-calorie diet plan and you don&#8217;t get enough protein, your body starts to shed muscle instead of fat.</p>
<p>You may also suffer from fatigue, depression, anxiety, and anemia (low iron). Your body relies on nine essential amino acids, and when you don&#8217;t get enough protein, you experience a deficiency of these amino acids.</p>
<p>Your exact symptoms can vary depending on which amino acids your body is missing.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #000080;">2. Try These High-Protein Foods</span></h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-1849 size-full" src="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/salmon-egg-cheese-vegetables-high-protein-diet-plans-us.jpg?resize=625%2C388&#038;ssl=1" alt="Try These High-Protein Foods | High Protein Diet Plans To Get Cut and Lean | high-protein diet" width="625" height="388" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/salmon-egg-cheese-vegetables-high-protein-diet-plans-us.jpg?w=625&amp;ssl=1 625w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/salmon-egg-cheese-vegetables-high-protein-diet-plans-us.jpg?resize=300%2C186&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px" data-recalc-dims="1" /><br />
Some of the best high-protein foods include lean grass-fed beef, organic chicken, salmon, eggs, bone broth, and goat cheese. When comparing different foods, take into account how much protein they offer based on their weight.</p>
<p>For instance, 3 ounces of lean beef has about 22 grams of protein, and three ounces of goat cheese has 21 grams of protein. In contrast with other foods, you may eat 3 ounces but get a lot less protein.</p>
<p>Also, remember to look at the food&#8217;s other advantages <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/whole-eggs-vs-egg-whites-which-is-best-for-you/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">such as vitamins</a>, minerals, healing benefits, pH levels, and so on. Most importantly, pay attention to how different foods make you feel.</p>
<p>If you get an energy boost after eating a certain food while another makes you feel sluggish, you need probably to focus on the first option.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #000080;">3. Focus on Lean Proteins</span></h3>
<p>As a general rule of thumb, you need one gram of lean protein for every pound of body weight. For instance, if you weigh 180 pounds, you need 180 grams of lean protein per day.</p>
<p>But depending on your weight loss goals, you may need to adjust that amount. This helps you to keep your lean muscle mass while losing unwanted fat.</p>
<p>In contrast, if you eat proteins with lots of fats, you will struggle to meet your weight loss goals.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #000080;">4. Don&#8217;t Avoid High-Protein Diets Because You&#8217;re Vegan</span></h3>
<p>When many people think of high-protein diets, they assume that you have to eat meat. Luckily, that isn&#8217;t the case.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re vegetarian or vegan, you can still enjoy a high protein diet. Lentils, black beans, and almonds are all extremely high-protein options.</p>
<p>You may also want to eat chia seeds, hummus (chickpeas), and soybeans as well as a variety of other nuts and beans. This type of diet is much healthier than simply trying to get by on sugars and carbs.</p>
<p>To ensure you get all the amino acids you need, consider focusing on complete proteins. On their own, foods such as quinoa, buckwheat, and soy are complete proteins. But in many other cases, you need to pair two foods to get a complete protein.</p>
<p>This includes iconic pairings such as rice and beans and hummus and pita.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #000080;">5. Minimize the Carbohydrates You Eat</span></h3>
<p>On the flip side of the coin, you need to avoid excess carbs when you&#8217;re on high protein diet plans. For a low-carb diet, stay away from simple sugars and basic carbs.</p>
<p>Instead, make the most of your calories by focusing on fiber-rich carbs such as oats and whole grain bread.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #000080;">6. Remember to Hydrate</span></h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-1848 size-full" src="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/adult-girl-drinking-water-beautiful-view-high-protein-diet-plans-px.jpg?resize=625%2C417&#038;ssl=1" alt="Remember to Hydrate | High Protein Diet Plans To Get Cut and Lean | weight loss" width="625" height="417" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/adult-girl-drinking-water-beautiful-view-high-protein-diet-plans-px.jpg?w=625&amp;ssl=1 625w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/adult-girl-drinking-water-beautiful-view-high-protein-diet-plans-px.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px" data-recalc-dims="1" /><br />
Water is essential when you&#8217;re on a high-protein, low-carb diet. Water helps your cells to function. It also lubricates joints, minimizes dry mouth, and promotes cardiovascular health.</p>
<p>On the outside, it keeps your skin looking supple and youthful. Inside of your body, it helps to filter waste. Additionally, if you don&#8217;t drink enough water, that can prevent your kidneys from functioning correctly, and your kidneys play a key role in high-protein diets.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #000080;">7. Stay Away from One-Size-Fits-All Diets</span></h3>
<p>Over the years, a number of high-protein diets have become popular. They include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Protein Power Diet</strong> — Developed in the 1990s, this diet involves over 54 percent fat, and it requires you to avoid carbs as well as fruits and starchy vegetables.</li>
<li><strong>The Zone Diet</strong> — Also from the mid-1990s, this diet created by Dr. Barry Sears consists of 40 percent carbohydrates, 30 percent protein, and 30 percent fat. It focuses on having frequent low calories snacks.</li>
<li><strong>The Atkins Diet</strong> — Focused on proteins and fat with a minimum of carbs, this diet was popular around the turn of the millennium. Although many people reported losing weight, the excessive amount of fat associated with this diet can increase the risk of kidney damage and heart disease or other issues.</li>
<li><strong>South Beach Diet</strong> — Debuted in 2003, the South Beach Diet allows more carbs than many other high-protein diets, but it restricts fruits and carrots because of their position on the glycemic index.</li>
<li><strong>Sugar Busters Diet</strong> — Unlike most high-protein diets, this plan is over half carbohydrates, but it minimizes simple starches such as white rice, white flour, potatoes, corn, and even carrots.</li>
<li><strong>Stillman Diet</strong> — One of the diets recommending the highest levels of protein, this diet pushes you toward a plan that is 64 percent protein, 33 percent fat, and just 3 percent carbohydrates.</li>
</ul>
<p>Although some people have had success with these diets, the main issue is that they offer a one-size-fits all approach to dieting. You need a plan that is customized to your size, your body type, and your objectives.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #000080;">8. Help Yourself Establish New Habits</span></h3>
<p>Whether you&#8217;re on a high-protein diet or any other type of <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/tips-on-how-to-lose-weight-get-in-shape-3-reason-this-works/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">weight loss plan</a>, you have to establish new habits and that can be hard. Keep in mind that on average, it takes about 66 days to establish a new habit. Some people get in the swing of things after 18 days, while others take several months.</p>
<p>Be aware that your new eating habits may take a while to become routine and take some steps to help yourself along the way.</p>
<p>Consider dieting with a friend or joining a challenge to keep yourself motivated. Take measurements and photographs so that you can see your progress along the way.</p>
<p>You may want to consider one-cheat meal per week. This gives some people something to look forward to during the week, making it easier to focus on their diet.</p>
<p>In other cases, you may find that you prefer to just stick to your diet because cheating once can turn into cheating all the time.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #000080;">9. Plan for Cravings</span></h3>
<p>As you settle into your new diet, cravings are inevitable. So that you don&#8217;t yield to them, you need to be prepared.</p>
<p>Stock up your cupboards with healthy high-protein snacks and get rid of the unnecessary carbohydrates in your home. When you&#8217;re out and about, bring healthy snacks.</p>
<p>Then, you&#8217;ll be less tempted consume a lot of calories at the vending machines or the fast food drive-through. Protein shakes and bars tend to work really to quench sugar cravings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Before starting to work out and delving into your high protein diet plans, you need to know several things before starting to workout. Watch this video about that below:</strong></p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='1170' height='659' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/jeXkj6BulYA?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></p>
<p>For losing weight and building muscle, high protein diet plans can be the way forward. But, you don&#8217;t want to select a cookie-cutter plan.</p>
