That is a scary number!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Good thing you found this article because </span><b><i>we aren’t going to let YOU be “most” people! </i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lower temps do not have to equal larger waistlines! You just have to have a plan! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this short read we will &#8230;</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Explain why winter weight gain happens. Knowing why is important if you want to prevent it and the reason is probably not what you think. In fact, it is partially not even your fault!</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tell you why fall/winter is actually the BEST time to start a diet and training plan.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Give you 7 easy pro tips that will help guide you through the next few months. </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You may believe winter weight gain happens because of the holidays. Those extra home cooked meals and holiday parties are certainly a factor. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But </span><b><i>there is a DAILY issue you need to be prepared to fight </i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">if you want to avoid packing on winter pounds.</span></p>
<p><b>WHY YOU REALLY PACK ON POUNDS AFTER LABOR DAY</b></p>
<p><img class="size-large wp-image-7471" src="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_130930953.jpeg?resize=1024%2C512&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="512" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_130930953.jpeg?resize=1024%2C512&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_130930953.jpeg?resize=300%2C150&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_130930953.jpeg?resize=768%2C384&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_130930953.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_130930953.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the spring and summer months, you are given what we call a</span><b> fitness freebie. </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You get a </span><b><i>seasonal motivation boost</i></b> <span style="font-weight: 400;">that doesn’t happen when temperatures start to drop, and you begin to pull out the chunky sweaters and comfy leggings. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not only is the sun shining (which makes you happier because of Vitamin D), you are wearing LESS clothing in the summer months. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I don’t know about you, but knowing I’m going to be exposing more skin makes walking in the gym a little easier. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Covering up in layers, no doubt leads to the temptation to slack on body goals! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Knowing your arms, legs, and abs will be less exposed can easily be an excuse to slack. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, being layered up often means you don’t SEE the extra pounds, so they are easier to ignore.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But there is more to it than being bundled up….</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-7477" src="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_236518834.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_236518834.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_236518834.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_236518834.jpeg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_236518834.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_236518834.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span>The #1 reason you slack on health and fitness goals in colder months ISN’T EVEN YOUR FAULT!!</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, you have a part to play in all of this, but</span><b><i> there is actually a scientific reason why you have less desire to train and eat healthy when the sunshine of summer fades.</i></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We will explain why a little further down. But ya know what really stinks? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The scientific reason why we all experience these motivation slumps in the winter only adds to an even bigger issue with motivation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span>It doesn’t matter what season it is motivation ALWAYS comes and goes!</p>
<p>Spring, Summer, Fall, or Winter &#8211; you can NEVER rely on it!</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, what can you do when lack of sunshine and warm temps leave you even more tempted to hit snooze and reach for comfort foods? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You certainly don’t throw your hands up in the air and wait until January to make a resolution to crash diet to get your body ready for spring. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Believe it or not, RIGHT NOW is actually the IDEAL time to get started! </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you </span><b><i>START NOW, </i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">you will develop discipline and a routine heading into the holidays. This will put you in a great place mentally and physically to relax and “indulge” a little more at all those holiday gatherings! </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><b><i>Look at it this way ..<br />
</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Would you rather head into the holiday season already making progress toward your goals and be in a great spot <em>(where it would be okay even if you did gain an extra pound or two?)</em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Or would you rather put it off and only add more fat on top of what you want to lose?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The answer is clear— the solution to getting the motivation needed to make it happen, not so much.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But don’t worry! We’ve got ya covered</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (no pun intended)</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with a few easy motivation hacks!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><b>7 TIPS TO STAY MOTIVATED AS SEASONS CHANGE</b></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><b><br />
</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the number one questions we always get is … “<em>I am just not motivated. How can I motivate myself to train and eat better?”</em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As we mentioned earlier, it doesn&#8217;t matter what season it is, </span><b><i>you can’t always rely on motivation. </i></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you have it, great! You should certainly take advantage of it! But you have to know that it is totally normal to not have much of it. Even professional athletes lack motivation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You have to develop other daily habits that create discipline if you want to succeed long term!</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are a few of our pro tips that we use with our clients, specifically when temperatures drop, and motivation seems to be at its lowest! </span></p>
<p><b>TIP #1: Switch To An At Home Training Program</b></p>
<p><img class="size-large wp-image-7448" src="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_185038762.jpeg?resize=1024%2C647&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="647" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_185038762.jpeg?resize=1024%2C647&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_185038762.jpeg?resize=300%2C189&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_185038762.jpeg?resize=768%2C485&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_185038762.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_185038762.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you know that getting out of bed and stepping into the winter elements is going to be an excuse trigger, make a plan to train at home during cooler months! Some of the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">most effective and challenging workouts </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">only require your body weight and </span><b><i>maybe</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a set of dumbbells or some resistance bands.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A good fat-blasting, muscle-building sweat session can 100% be achieved from the comfort of your home!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adjustable dumbbells, ankle weights, resistance bands, a jump rope, etc., are all things that are inexpensive and can easily be stored in a closet or under your bed and pulled out anytime you don’t feel like leaving the house.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But if you have </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">the right training program</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><b><i>you don’t need any of that. </i></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our favorite </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">at-home bodyweight-only program</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is called</span><b> MOVE. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was designed to help you achieve your fitness goals without a single piece of equipment, and each workout is under 20 minutes! </span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Learn more about MOVE by watching the video below!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you need </span><b>a little extra “nudge”</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to get up and get moving, another </span><b>pro-tip we use</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is keeping some </span><a href="https://sculptnation.com/products/pre-workout" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><b>PRE WORKOUT </b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">on your bedside table. Have it already blended up and chug it as soon as your alarm goes off!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By the time you have brushed your teeth and put on your workout clothes, you will have a nice little jolt of energy and</span><b><i> tons of motivation</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to get going before you have a chance to come up with an excuse! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the bottom of this article, we will tell you about a big end of summer sale happening so that you can stock up on our </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">favorite </span><a href="https://sculptnation.com/products/pre-workout" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><b>PRE WORKOUT</b></a><strong> for 40% off when you use code: LABORDAY40 at checkout! </strong></p>
<p><b>TIP #2: Make Your Workouts Seasonal</b></p>
<p><img class="size-large wp-image-7452" src="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_65703942.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_65703942.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_65703942.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_65703942.jpeg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_65703942.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_65703942.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Embrace the change of seasons and take advantage of activities that you can only do in fall or winter! </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Go on a fall hike and view all the gorgeous foliage.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Try rock climbing.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Walk around a corn maze or pumpkin patch with your family. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you live in a snowy climate, go skiing, sledding, build snowmen with your kids, etc.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Go ice skating.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lace-up your sneakers, go for a walk or run at night, and admire all the Christmas lights and decorations.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are some things you can only do and see during specific times of the year. So instead of missing sunshine and water sports, focus on all the positive things that only come about with cooler temps!</span></p>
<p><b>TIP #3: Try Something Totally New</b></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-7454" src="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_361152601.jpeg?resize=1024%2C514&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="514" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_361152601.jpeg?resize=1024%2C514&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_361152601.jpeg?resize=300%2C151&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_361152601.jpeg?resize=768%2C386&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_361152601.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_361152601.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sometimes a change of routine is all you need to boost motivation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you have been doing all your gym lifts alone, recruit a gym buddy! Try switching up your cardio by skipping your solo runs and joining a group fitness class instead. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another option is to </span><b><i>allow yourself to slow down!</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> If you have been crushing it all spring and summer with intense training and hardcore workouts, </span><b><i>it may actually be time to take it down a notch. </i></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Going full force 365 can cause your stress hormone cortisol to increase. This can lead to a host of drawbacks, including weight gain, muscle loss, poor moods, fatigue, and occasional issues sleeping! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We aren’t saying you should become lazy! But if you have been crushing it 24/7 all spring and summer, your body (and mind) may need to slow down.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Use the next few months to embrace a slower routine. </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Commit to daily yoga.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Focus on becoming more flexible.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Switch to low or moderate-intensity cardio, instead of HIIT.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Try out some bodyweight workouts instead of heavy lifting.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Giving your body a couple of months to recover might even make you more responsive when you decide to kick things up again come spring/summer!</span></p>
<p><b>TIP #4: Stay Accountable</b></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-7457" src="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_266584820.jpeg?resize=1024%2C768&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="768" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_266584820.jpeg?resize=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_266584820.jpeg?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_266584820.jpeg?resize=768%2C576&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_266584820.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_266584820.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><b><br />
</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">The best way to stick to a plan is to have someone that you report back to. This could be a friend, family member, a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">social media community</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, or even a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">coach. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Including someone else, or even just telling someone else about your health and fitness goals and asking them to check in with you to make sure you are sticking to the plan, is a great way to keep the promises you make to yourself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you prefer to fly solo, it helps to create visuals. Make a vision board, create a daily checklist you can mark off after each workout, or keep an accomplishment journal.</span></p>
<p><b>TIP #5: Set A Spring Goal</b></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-7458" src="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_47332240.jpeg?resize=1024%2C680&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="680" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_47332240.jpeg?resize=1024%2C680&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_47332240.jpeg?resize=300%2C199&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_47332240.jpeg?resize=768%2C510&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_47332240.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_47332240.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">March may seem like a long time away, but it will be back before you know it, and 6 months is a long time to make significant changes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Setting a goal is a great way to encourage yourself to push past discomforts and temptation, but there is a science to goal setting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The key to creating goals that stick .. </span><b><i>be REALISTIC and SPECIFIC!</i></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s start with </span><b><i>reality. </i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">You should always focus on one goal at a time and make sure you are being honest with yourself if that goal is really attainable.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you know that your schedule will never allow you to work out 6 days a week, why would you choose a program that requires you to do that?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you know it’s not healthy to attempt to lose 10 pounds a week, why would you aim that high?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you love carbs, why would you go on a KETO diet? </span></p>
<p><b><i>Doing these things will essentially set yourself up for failure.</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Set attainable goals that fit YOUR lifestyle. You can always bump things up if your schedule allows, or you notice you aren’t pushing yourself hard enough. Just keep in mind that being realistic isn’t the same as not believing in yourself or making excuses. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moving on to being </span><b><i>specific.</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The more specific you are about your goals, the more likely you will be to reach them. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It may seem like it’s good enough to say things like .. I want to look good, lose weight, or get ripped! </span><b><i>But you have to dig deeper than that!! </i></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wanting to “lose weight,” for example, is an excellent place to start. But ask yourself what that means to you?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you expand on that and say &#8212; “I want to lose 10 pounds of fat. I will do this by not eating any sweets and doing the V Shred </span><a href="https://vshred.com/sp/move/soc-all/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><b>MOVE </b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">program for 30 consecutive days. I am doing this because I want to have better self-esteem and a head start on bikini season.” &#8212; that makes your goal more specific.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The more specific (and attainable) your goals are, the more likely you will be to not give up!</span></p>
<p><b>TIP #6: Reward Yourself</b></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-7459" src="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/vin_sant_32048508_366936073798151_433609263865135104_n.jpg?resize=882%2C1024&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="882" height="1024" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/vin_sant_32048508_366936073798151_433609263865135104_n.jpg?resize=882%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 882w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/vin_sant_32048508_366936073798151_433609263865135104_n.jpg?resize=258%2C300&amp;ssl=1 258w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/vin_sant_32048508_366936073798151_433609263865135104_n.jpg?resize=768%2C892&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/vin_sant_32048508_366936073798151_433609263865135104_n.jpg?w=1080&amp;ssl=1 1080w" sizes="(max-width: 882px) 100vw, 882px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you have checked a “mini goal” off your list, treat yourself. Knowing that you have a reward coming to celebrate your efforts will make you want to achieve it even more. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It may be tempting to make your reward one of your favorite “forbidden foods” but we never suggest that you reward yourself this way.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You aren’t a dog. You should never reward “good behavior” with food. Having this mentality can create a really unhealthy relationship with food.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You need to eat healthy MOST of the time, control your portions, and see food as fuel. But if you are craving something that isn’t quite as healthy as your grilled chicken and rice, never feel like you need to lose 20 pounds to “deserve” a bite of cake, or nice dinner out with your family. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instead of rewarding yourself with food, buy yourself something you have been wanting. Maybe some new workout clothes, a massage, or an extra $20 bucks in your vacation fund! </span></p>

<p><b>TIP #7: Make Mental Health Top Priority</b></p>
<p><img class="size-large wp-image-7460" src="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_255894146.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_255894146.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_255894146.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_255894146.jpeg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_255894146.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_255894146.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Earlier, we mentioned that cold weather motivation dips may not be your fault.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’m sure you have heard of winter blues. Well, it’s a real thing. Less natural light can cause dips in serotonin, the neurotransmitter that regulates mood.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The dark and dreary days of winter can also cause your body to produce more of the sleep hormone melatonin. This shift can disrupt your body and impact your sleep patterns and overall mood.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are a few ways that you can focus on improving your mental health.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Invest in a light therapy box that simulates natural daylight.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Make sure you are supplementing with or eating plenty of foods with Vitamin D.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Start journaling. There is a lot of scientific evidence that supports putting your thoughts on paper provides a long list of benefits, including stress management, self-confidence, and goal setting. </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Suppose you still find yourself struggling with negative seasonal motivation shifts. In that case, you may need to experiment with taking</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> naturally sourced herbs</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to help support brain health and a positive mood.</span></p>
<p><b><i>Here are a few with some great scientific backing to help boost mood.</i></b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>EnXtra: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">A natural caffeine-free patent-pending botanical ingredient that has been shown to help increase dopamine levels.**It is also one of the first and only natural caffeine-free patent-pending botanical ingredients shown to boost mental alertness &amp; acuity for hours or ending in a huge caffeine energy crash.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Piper Nigrum Fruit Extract:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> A very specific type of black pepper that has been shown to help increase both serotonin and dopamine.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>L-Theanine:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> A powerful amino acid that is believed to help reduce occasional anxiety brought on by stressful situations.</span></li>
</ul>

<p><b><i>BOTTOM LINE IF YOU WANT TO STAY MOTIVATED YEAR ROUND</i></b><b><i><br />
</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you put away the shorts and swimsuits and shift out of bikini season, it’s common for motivation to “fall back” with the clocks. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The seasons have to change (unless you live near the equator) &#8211; so you have to figure out ways to</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">not let your fitness goals go into hibernation mode!</span><b><i> </i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pumpkin spice lattes are only here for a limited time, but getting into shape isn’t seasonal! </span><i>It&#8217;s a year-round commitment!!</i><i> </i></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Choosing the right pre-workout supplement can help increase the benefits of your exercise and aid you in building lean muscle. While there are many &#8220;wonder pills&#8221; on the market that guarantee you bulk with the pop of a pill, getting a healthy and toned body requires more effort.</p>
<p>You have to put in the exercise to see the results you want. You also have to provide your body with the <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/vitamins-weight-loss/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">right supplements and nutrients</a> to build the muscle and burn the fat.</p>
<p>When choosing the right pre-workout supplements it is vital to get what your body needs and avoid the things it doesn&#8217;t.</p>
<h2>What You Should Be Looking For In Your Workout Supplement</h2>
<p>In This Article:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#should">What Your Workout Supplement Should Have</a></li>
<li><a href="#not">What Your Workout Supplement Should Not Have</a></li>
</ul>
<div id="should"></div>
<h3>What Your Workout Supplement Should Have</h3>
<p>There are many things your body will need to best enhance your workout process. Some of the things that you should find in the supplement you choose include:</p>
<h3>1. Caffeine</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone" src="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/caffeine-coffee-spilled-coffee-beans-close-up-workout-supplement-px.jpg?resize=625%2C417&#038;ssl=1" alt="Caffeine | What To Look For In A Workout Supplement | pre-workout supplements" width="625" height="417" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>Caffeine can provide you with the energy your body needs to work out. It also increases blood flow which allows your muscles to get the blood and nutrients they need.</p>
<p>Additionally, caffeine increases anaerobic capacity and muscle endurance. This will provide you with a more effective workout.</p>
<h3>2. Branched Chain Amino Acids</h3>
<p>Amino acids produce nitric oxide. This is an important supplement for increasing blood flow and providing the body with the extra oxygen it needs.</p>
<p>These ingredients are also shown to improve <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/why-am-i-gaining-weight-working-out/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">muscle strength and growth</a>. Amino acids help you workout harder, longer, and faster.</p>
<p>They also help your body repair itself quicker creating less downtime after your workout.</p>
<h3>3. Creatine</h3>
<p>Creatine is a naturally occurring acid that is already present in the body. When used in a synthetic form, creatine can boost the production of ATP.</p>
<p>ATP will aid your muscle in repairing itself and growing when it is under stress. Creatine is one of the best performance enhancing supplements.</p>
<p>Creatine will give users an extra burst of energy that can help them to push a little further during their workout routine.</p>
<h3>4. Citrulline</h3>
<p>Citrulline is an amino acid organic compound that can help boost performance when working out.</p>
<p>Some studies show that using citrulline malate can assist in maintaining high performance over longer periods of time.</p>
<h3>5. Glutamine</h3>
<p>Glutamine is an amino acid that your body will produce. It comes out of your muscles during stressful situations such as during workouts.</p>
<p>By adding this supplement before your workout, you will recover the amount your body depletes and help maintain your muscle mass. Often times you will need to take glutamine in supplement form because it is naturally found in meat, beans, fish, and nuts.</p>
<p>These are not food best eaten right before working out.</p>
<h3>6. Whey Protein Powder</h3>
<p>Whey protein is often associated with fueling workout regiments. Though with its popularity comes a lot of confusion about the benefits it provides.</p>
<p>The truth is that protein powders will serve a variety of different purposes. There are some designed for those who are trying to stay lean and build lean muscles.</p>
<p>Others have large amounts of protein as well as calories to help build muscle mass. No matter which protein you choose make sure that it contains whey protein.</p>
<p>Whey protein contains ingredients proven to promote muscle protein synthesis. Choose ones that have lower calories and fewer ingredients to make sure you are getting the nutrition you need.</p>
<p>You should also make sure to adjust the amount you consume based on your body weight. Often times you may need two or three shakes a day combined with your workout.</p>
<p>Always remember though that these are supplements and you should get your primary protein from food.</p>
<h3>7. Beta-Alanine</h3>
<p>Beta-Alanine is an amino acid that reduces muscle fatigue. It does this by boosting your body&#8217;s natural carnosine.</p>
<p>This substance helps prevent the buildup of acid which can cause muscle fatigue, strain, and corrosion. Your body only has and can only produce so much carnosine based on the beta-alanine in your system.</p>
<p>Taking the supplement in addition to what your body produces will help you produce more carnosine. Beta-Alanine is often felt after a workout with a slight tingling sensation in your skin.</p>
<p>This tingling means that your body is reducing muscle fatigue by increasing your endurance making your cardiovascular fitness more productive.</p>
<h3>8. Carbohydrates</h3>
<p>Carbohydrates is often considered a dirty word when it comes to losing weight and dieting. While it is true that you should cut carbs to lose fat, if your goal is to burn fat and increase muscle, carbs will give you the fuel you need.</p>
<p>You should make sure to consume carbs <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA3oCc9PK-M" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">once when you wake up and once before you workout each day</a>. This will allow you to turn the carbs into energy and reduce the risk of it turning into fat consumed by the body.</p>
<p>After your work out the carbs will release sugar increasing your glucose level. Higher glucose levels will reduce the amount of cortisol excreted that can consume lean muscle tissue.</p>
<p>While you can gain your carbohydrates from consuming a variety of simple carbs sometimes it is easier to regulate your carb intake through the use of supplements.</p>
<div id="not"></div>
<h3>What Your Workout Supplement Should Not Have</h3>
<p>While there are many things you want to make sure are in your supplements there are also things that you want to avoid. Avoiding certain things can help you get the right nutrients for your goals and body size. Things you should try to avoid include:</p>
<h3>1. Ingredients That are Under-Dosed</h3>
<p>There is much research about how ingredients can be effective and what you need to consume to gain the benefits. Check the label and make sure that the items included are within the recommended dosage to be effective.</p>
<p>There is no reason to pay high prices for an ingredient with not enough milligrams for you to see the benefits.</p>
<h3>2. Dyes and Artificial Sweeteners</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone" src="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/eggs-staining-easter-dye-food-workout-supplement-PB.jpg?resize=625%2C417&#038;ssl=1" alt="Dyes and Artificial Sweeteners | What To Look For In A Workout Supplement | post-workout supplements" width="625" height="417" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>There have been many studies on the ill effects of food dyes and artificial sweeteners. These items have no reason for consumption and provide no benefit.</p>
<p>Check for healthier alternatives when you see sweeteners or dyes on the label.</p>
<h3>3. Unnecessary Ingredients</h3>
<p>Sometimes a workout supplement can contain additional ingredients that are actually useless when consumed. Companies often feel that by offering more ingredients, the consumer is getting more for their money. In truth, you will end up consuming a lot of things that you don&#8217;t need.</p>
<h3>4. Using Chemical Jargon</h3>
<p>Some companies will try to sound more technical by using the chemical names of certain ingredients. They do this because consumers sometimes equate scientific words with better ingredients. In truth, most of these are common ingredients. Knowing what they are is important in knowing the benefits to expect as well as what you are consuming. Technical jargon can create a false impression of the product and is often used as a deceptive technique.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>If you don&#8217;t have a workout supplement yet, a healthy pre-workout meal may help you with your exercise. Get the recipe for a delicious snack that will increase your energy during your workout from the video below:</strong><br />
<iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='1170' height='659' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/lvto3DdoUVM?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></p>
<p>You are putting a lot into your workout routine and your workout supplement should do the same. By making sure your supplements include the items that you need for workout and recovery and avoiding things you don&#8217;t will provide you with the best benefits. Get the right fuel to create the body you deserve by choosing the right ingredients that work for you and your goals.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There’s a lot of controversy about using vitamins for weight loss. Do these pills target belly fat? Do these vitamins work like fat burning vitamins and minerals? These are more helpful than you think, but it’s equally important to know their exact role in your weight loss journey.</p>
<h2>Vitamins for Weight Loss | How They Help Shed the Excess Pounds</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span style="color: #000080;">1. Reduction of Chronic Inflammation</span></h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-1226 size-full" src="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/handsome-young-man-exercising-outdoors-stretching-vitamins-for-weight-loss-ss.jpg?resize=625%2C417&#038;ssl=1" alt="Reduction of Chronic Inflammation | Why Are Vitamins So Important For Weight Loss? | best natural supplements for weight loss" width="625" height="417" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/handsome-young-man-exercising-outdoors-stretching-vitamins-for-weight-loss-ss.jpg?w=625&amp;ssl=1 625w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/handsome-young-man-exercising-outdoors-stretching-vitamins-for-weight-loss-ss.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px" data-recalc-dims="1" /><br />
One of the benefits of vitamins for weight loss is the reduction of chronic inflammation. Obesity and inflammation have a complex and delicate relationship. Suffice to say, when the body is in this state, it also boosts the production of free radicals.</p>
<p>These free radicals can cause cellular damage. It then leads to a series of conditions that can impact your weight loss. They also lower your immune function. Getting sick all the time can hamper your <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/tips-on-how-to-lose-weight-get-in-shape-3-reason-this-works/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">workout plans</a>.</p>
<p>Many factors can result in chronic inflammation. One of the reasons is nutrient deficiency. While vitamins themselves cannot lead to fat weight loss, they can improve it.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #000080;">2. Response to Insulin</span></h3>
<p>Insulin is a naturally occurring hormone. It’s one of the most important ones too.</p>
<p>When you eat food, the body converts some parts of it into blood sugar or glucose. The body then needs to deliver it to the cells for their different functions. They do not receive this sugar immediately, though.</p>
<p>This is where insulin comes in. Produced by the pancreas, it introduces glucose to the cells. Picture it as a messenger knocking on the doors of the cells.</p>
<p>There are certain situations when the cells do not receive glucose despite the presence of insulin. It then forces the organ to produce more of the hormone while the supply of blood sugar increases. In turn, it results in diabetes.</p>
<p>The vitamins for weight loss are not enough to treat the condition, but some of them can improve insulin sensitivity. These include vitamin D.</p>
<p>The same vitamin also enhances the function of leptin. It’s a hormone that helps tell your brain you’re already full (or starving). You can then pair this vitamin with <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/weight-loss-with-apple-cider-vinegar/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">apple cider vinegar</a> to further enhance the effect.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #000080;">3. Energy</span></h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-1229 size-full" src="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/tired-exhausted-man-runner-sweating-after-vitamins-for-weight-loss-ss.jpg?resize=625%2C417&#038;ssl=1" alt="Energy | Why Are Vitamins So Important For Weight Loss? | best natural supplements for weight loss" width="625" height="417" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/tired-exhausted-man-runner-sweating-after-vitamins-for-weight-loss-ss.jpg?w=625&amp;ssl=1 625w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/tired-exhausted-man-runner-sweating-after-vitamins-for-weight-loss-ss.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px" data-recalc-dims="1" /><br />
The best way to lose weight always involves a <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/eating-for-a-6-pack-fat-shredding-foods/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">good nutrition</a> and exercise. The problem with the latter is you can lose some of the essential vitamins in your body.</p>
<p>When you’re on an intense workout plan, it’s best to invest in vitamins for weight loss and energy. These include the B vitamins.</p>
<p>B vitamins are of different types. Some of these are riboflavin (B6), choline, and cobalamin (B12). They perform different jobs in the body. They, though, tend to work toward your level of energy and metabolism.</p>
<p>Vitamin B12 for weight loss help break down fats, carbohydrates, and proteins. They improve the delivery of oxygen to the brain and cells to let them function at an optimum level. These can also help in enhancing the function of the muscles.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #000080;">4. Thyroid Health</span></h3>
<p>There are several reasons why you’re not losing weight. One of these is thyroid dysfunction, especially hypothyroidism. It refers to the sluggish or low production of thyroid hormones.</p>
<p>Thyroid problems can have many different causes. The solutions too may include multiple approaches.</p>
<p>You can take vitamins for weight loss and metabolism as part of the plan. One of the vitamins that promote weight loss and healthy thyroid is vitamin B2 or riboflavin. It can prevent the suppression of the hormone production.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #000080;">5. Reduction of Fat Absorption</span></h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-1231 size-full" src="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/body-fat-measurements-man-holding-caliper-vitamins-for-weight-loss-ss-1.jpg?resize=625%2C417&#038;ssl=1" alt="Reduction of Fat Absorption | Why Are Vitamins So Important For Weight Loss? | best natural supplements for weight loss" width="625" height="417" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/body-fat-measurements-man-holding-caliper-vitamins-for-weight-loss-ss-1.jpg?w=625&amp;ssl=1 625w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/body-fat-measurements-man-holding-caliper-vitamins-for-weight-loss-ss-1.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px" data-recalc-dims="1" /><br />
Do you know the body has different types of fat? The one in the middle, for example, is visceral fat. Contrary to popular belief, your body needs fat. It doesn’t only keep you warm. It stores your reserves.</p>
<p>One of the best natural supplements for weight loss can be calcium. Granted, it’s a mineral more than a vitamin, but it works symbiotically with vitamin D. The latter increases the body’s absorption of the mineral. Many also tend to consider calcium as a vitamin now.</p>
<p>How can calcium aid in weight loss? A Tennessee study suggested it affects the way the cells burn fat. The more calcium there is in the cell, the more fat it tends to burn.</p>
<p>It also reduces the amount of fat your body absorbs. It binds to the fat in your intestinal tract and prevents it from reaching your bloodstream.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #000080;">6. Improved Fat-Burning Abilities</span></h3>
<p>One of the vitamins to <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/best-vitamins-weight-loss/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lose belly fat fast</a> can be vitamin C. For the longest time, it’s associated with an improved immune function. More studies show it can do more.</p>
<p>For one, it encourages your body to produce collagen. Collagen is one of the most abundant types of protein in the muscles and tendons. It helps create the structure. As a person gets older, the production of collagen also decreases. They also lose their muscle mass.</p>
<p>By increasing the production of collagen, the body can less likely lose muscle mass. Muscles, on the other hand, tend to burn more calories than fat. This protein also significantly improves the feeling of satiety.</p>
<p>Vitamin C can also help your body burn fat during an exercise routine. Its presence in the bloodstream means your body burns 30 percent more fat during exercise.</p>

<p>B vitamins are water-soluble vitamins that convert the body’s food intake into energy. They aid in digesting fats, proteins, and carbohydrates.</p>
<p>Some sources of B vitamins are food items like fish, poultry, milk, eggs, bread, whole wheat cereals, fresh orange juice, and bananas.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #000080;">2. Vitamin C</span></h3>

Vitamin C, also known as ascorbic acid, is usually found in food and is often used as a dietary supplement. Studies suggest it aids in both the regeneration of antioxidants and lowering body mass index.</p>
<p>The intake of Vitamin C coupled with exercise helps fight obesity by protecting cells and increasing body fat oxidation.</p>
<p>Natural sources of vitamin C include lemons, strawberries, papayas, kale, bell peppers, and broccoli.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #000080;">3. Vitamin D</span></h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-614 size-full" src="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/black-slate-table-product-rich-vitamin-best-vitamins-for-weight-loss-ss.jpg?resize=625%2C417&#038;ssl=1" alt="Vitamin D | Best Vitamins for Weight Loss: Vitamins and Minerals that Will Help You Shed Some Pounds | vitamins that help you lose weight" width="625" height="417" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/black-slate-table-product-rich-vitamin-best-vitamins-for-weight-loss-ss.jpg?w=625&amp;ssl=1 625w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/black-slate-table-product-rich-vitamin-best-vitamins-for-weight-loss-ss.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>Vitamin D is a fat-soluble vitamin. It promotes proper absorption of calcium and loss of fat.</p>
<p>One study showed a direct correlation between low Vitamin D levels and obesity.</p>
<p>Fortified juices, tuna, salmon, soy milk, egg yolk, and cheese are common food sources of Vitamin D. Although present in food, the best source of this fat-soluble vitamin is sunlight.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #000080;">4. Calcium</span></h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-618 size-full" src="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/vitamin-d-calcium-tablets-health-best-vitamins-for-weight-loss-pb.jpg?resize=625%2C407&#038;ssl=1" alt="Calcium | Best Vitamins for Weight Loss: Vitamins and Minerals that Will Help You Shed Some Pounds | vitamins that help you lose weight" width="625" height="407" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/vitamin-d-calcium-tablets-health-best-vitamins-for-weight-loss-pb.jpg?w=625&amp;ssl=1 625w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/vitamin-d-calcium-tablets-health-best-vitamins-for-weight-loss-pb.jpg?resize=300%2C195&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>The body benefits a lot from calcium intake. It has been proven to strengthen bones. Studies also show it helps decrease the likelihood of obesity and weight gain if paired with a cut down on caloric intake.</p>
<p>The best weight loss results from calcium can be achieved through regular servings of low-fat dairy products, green leafy vegetables, and soy.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #000080;">5. Magnesium</span></h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-616 size-full" src="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/products-containing-magnesium-bananas-pumpkin-seeds-best-vitamins-for-weight-loss-ss.jpg?resize=625%2C417&#038;ssl=1" alt="Magnesium | Best Vitamins for Weight Loss: Vitamins and Minerals that Will Help You Shed Some Pounds | vitamins that help you lose weight" width="625" height="417" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/products-containing-magnesium-bananas-pumpkin-seeds-best-vitamins-for-weight-loss-ss.jpg?w=625&amp;ssl=1 625w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/products-containing-magnesium-bananas-pumpkin-seeds-best-vitamins-for-weight-loss-ss.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>Magnesium functions mainly for energy production, conduction of nerve impulse, and muscle contraction. But, its role for the body is not limited to those.</p>
<p>Magnesium has been found out to be a good regulator of insulin and blood sugar levels. Thus, it plays an active role in controlling the risk of weight gain or obesity.</p>
<p>Stock up on nuts, legumes, avocado, dark chocolate, and spinach for your healthy dose of magnesium.</p>
