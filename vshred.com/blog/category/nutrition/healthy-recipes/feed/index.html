<p><strong>RECIPE 1: CAULIFLOWER BUNS</strong><br />
*Servings will vary pending the size you want to make your buns*</p>
<p>Using cauliflower instead of bread may sound unappealing, but with the right recipe, you won’t notice the cauliflower taste. You will only be left with hundreds of calories that you can use somewhere else (like on our healthy protein apple pie or sugar free jello shots.)</p>
<p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>1 (12 oz) bag cauliflower rice</li>
<li>1 egg white</li>
<li>1 tbsp coconut flour</li>
<li>1/4 tsp salt</li>
<li>1-1/2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
<li>1 tsp each of any other seasonings you want your bun to taste like!</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Directions:</strong><br />
Steam the cauliflower according to the package; drain until ALL WATER IS REMOVED (this is key) and let cool. You may want to use a cheesecloth or dry paper towels to make sure ALL water is removed.</p>
<p>Whisk together the coconut flour, baking powder, seasonings, add the cauliflower mixture, and egg white. Stirring until blended. If the batter is too dry, try adding teaspoons of unsweetened nut milk, or even water, to reach desired consistency.</p>
<p>There are several methods you can use to make your buns! Here are a few!</p>
<p><em><strong>Muffin Tins</strong></em><br />
Distribute evenly into muffin tins. Bake in the preheated oven for 40 to 45 minutes until golden brown at edges and centers feel set when lightly touched. Transfer to a cooling rack and let cool completely before removing. Slice them in half and serve up!</p>
<p><em><strong>QUICK TIP</strong></em> … You can also use this batter and pour it directly into a small sprayed skillet .. in a mini-waffle or pancake maker .. or even in the microwave!!</p>
<p><em><strong>For the microwave version&#8230;</strong> </em><br />
Pour a couple of inches of batter into a deep coffee mug. The larger it is, the better, unless you are eating a tiny patty of meat. Microwave time will vary, but zap it about 45 seconds and see if it’s ready. If not, keep adding 10 seconds at a time until done!</p>
<p>Don’t overcook, or it will be too dry. Dump out of the mug .. let cool .. cut in half …. Enjoy!</p>
<p><em><strong>TIP</strong></em> .. if they still don’t seem “toasted” enough. You can always throw them on the grill, put them in a toaster oven, or even an air-fryer!</p>

<p><strong>RECIPE 2: FIRECRACKER GRILLED SALMON</strong><br />
You may not think of salmon as being a 4th of July staple, but eating this super healthy fish on Independence Day .. is a tradition in New England!</p>
<p>According to history buffs, it started by coincidence. During the mid-summer months, salmon was plentiful in that region. Because it was “in season” &#8211; it always ended up on the dinner table for Independence Day! Even though salmon is available year-round now, the holiday tradition of eating salmon on the 4th remains to be a big deal there!</p>
<p>If you want to celebrate like the New Englanders .. this grilled salmon recipe is tasty, tangy, and packs just enough heat. The only calories it packs on, are from heart-healthy Omega 3’s!</p>
<p>The calorie content in salmon can be well over 300 calories, or as low as well under 200 calories.<br />
You want to always buy salmon labeled wild” and not farmed.</p>
<p>Wild salmon has fewer calories and half the fat content of the same amount of farmed salmon, and it is better for you.</p>
<p>While farmed salmon is sometimes praised for having slightly more omega-3 fatty acids, it is also very high in saturated fat &#8211; which is a type of fat you do not want.</p>
<p>Farmed salmon is also known for having more unsafe contaminants, chemicals from polluted waters, and other pollutants. Farmed salmon comes with the potential of antibiotic use.<br />
Wild salmon does not.</p>
<p>Some good choices would be WILD sockeye (red), king, keta, coho, or atlantic.</p>
<p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>4 (4-6 ounce) wild salmon fillets</li>
<li>⅛ -¼ cup peanut oil</li>
<li>2 tablespoons soy sauce (or coconut aminos)</li>
<li>2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar</li>
<li>2 tablespoons green onions, chopped</li>
<li>1 teaspoon brown sugar</li>
<li>1 cloves garlic, minced</li>
<li>½-1 teaspoon ground ginger</li>
<li>1 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes</li>
<li>½ teaspoon sesame oil</li>
<li>Pinch of salt</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Directions:</strong><br />
Place salmon fillets in a glass dish.</p>
<p>In a separate bowl, combine the peanut oil, soy sauce, vinegar, green onions, brown sugar, garlic, ginger, red pepper flakes, sesame oil, and salt. Whisk well and pour over the fish.</p>
<p>Cover and let marinate in the refrigerator for at least 4 to 6 hours.</p>
<p>Transfer filets to aluminum foil and place them on the grill.</p>
<p>Grill 10 minutes per inch of thickness. Turn over halfway through cooking.</p>
<p>*With any meat, it is best to use a food thermometer to ensure you do not under-cook or overcook for your liking. For salmon, it is re</p>
<p>commended the internal temp reach 145. Keep in mind that meat will continue to cook just a tad after it leaves the grill*</p>
<p>If you want to really keep with New England tradition, pair your salmon with some peas! They ate salmon with this nutritious veggie .. because it too .. was in season at the time!</p>
<p>Not sure how to enjoy this green veggie … check out our next recipe idea!</p>

<p><strong>RECIPE 3: GRILLED VEGGIES</strong><br />
Pair your salmon with some grilled sugar snap peas! Peas are one of several vegetables that are great cooked up on the grill!</p>
<p>Grilling your veggies is one of the healthiest side-dishes you can enjoy at your cookout. Put them on a kabob, throw them in some aluminum foil, or put them straight on the grill… no oil needed!</p>
<p>Many veggies do well on the grill, but a few really shine!</p>
<p>Asparagus, eggplant, mushrooms, onions, zucchini, eggplant, and bell peppers are excellent options!</p>
<p>Of course, you can’t go wrong with some corn on the cob. Just keep in in mind that corn is a vegetable that is higher in carbs!</p>

<p><strong>RECIPE 4: SUMMER SALAD </strong><br />
<strong>(Serving size &#8211; 1 large salad</strong>)</p>
<p>There is just something satisfying about a nice summer salad! This one follows a “red, white, and blue” theme .. with fresh blueberries, strawberries, and a virtually <em><strong>calorie free</strong></em> <em><strong>homemade vinaigrette dressing!</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>2 cups mixed salad greens of choice</li>
<li>1/4 c fresh blueberries</li>
<li>1/4 c fresh sliced strawberries</li>
<li>4 oz grilled lean protein from the grill</li>
<li>1/2 c cooked quinoa, rice, or cauliflower rice.</li>
<li>2 tbsp. Crumbled fat-free feta cheese</li>
<li>2 tbsp. Fat Free Vinaigrette (DIY recipe below)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Instructions:</strong><br />
Toss all ingredients except dressing together… mix up .. enjoy!</p>
<p><strong>**Healthy Homemade Vinaigrette Dressing**</strong><br />
This comes with a warning. You may never want to buy salad dressing again! It will be hard to believe that something this good .. is virtually calorie-free (minus the few calories in the mustard and stevia.)</p>
<p>The base of this recipe can be altered to go with any salad! Think greek seasonings and lemon juice for a greek salad! Get creative!</p>
<p>The amounts below should be enough to cover 1-2 salads.</p>
<p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>6 tablespoons vinegar: balsamic, white wine, champagne, apple cider, rice, or red wine vinegar.</li>
<li>4 teaspoons mustard: Dijon is the best, but you can also use yellow, brown, or spicy.</li>
<li>2 teaspoons Stevia (or a few squirts/drops of liquid stevia if that is what you typically use)</li>
<li>1 clove garlic, crush or minced (or some garlic salt)</li>
<li>2-4 tablespoons water</li>
<li>Salt &amp; pepper to taste</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Instructions:</strong><br />
Simply whisk together and pour over salad!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>RECIPE 5: HEALTHY POTATO SALAD</strong><br />
<strong>(Approx 8 Servings)</strong><br />
Traditional potato salad is drowning in high fat mayonnaise! This recipe lightens things up by using non-fat greek yogurt! We promise that making this smart swap will not compromise any of the flavor in this popular BBQ side dish. Go with one type of potato, or use a colorful medley, if you want to go with a “red-white-blue” theme!</p>
<p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>2 pounds russet, yukon gold, or red potatoes.</li>
<li>1 tablespoon salt (for cooking potatoes)</li>

<p><strong>RECIPE 6: Low(er) Calorie Baked Beans</strong><br />
<strong>(Approx 10-12 servings)</strong></p>
<p>Baked beans are a cookout staple, but they are often soaked in ketchup and/or BBQ (remember what we said about condiments containing all kinds of hidden calories.) They also usually have fatty bacon and lots of brown sugar and/or molasses.</p>
<p>This recipe dials down the calories by subbing turkey bacon .. reduces sodium and sugar by using tomato sauce .. and further lightens the sugar-load by using stevia brown sugar!</p>
<p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>2 slices turkey bacon (chopped)</li>
<li>1 diced onion</li>
<li>15 ounce can navy beans , rinsed and drained</li>
<li>15 ounce can pinto beans , rinsed and drained</li>
<li>15 ounce can northern beans , rinsed and drained</li>
<li>1/2 cup tomato sauce</li>
<li>1 1/2 cups water</li>
<li>1 tsp Worcestershire sauce</li>
<li>1/4 tsp smoked​ paprika</li>
<li>1/2 cup stevia brown sugar</li>
<li>1 tablespoon yellow mustard</li>
<li>1 teaspoon chili powder</li>
<li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
<li>1/4 teaspoon black pepper</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Instructions:</strong><br />
In a large cooking pot &#8211; add bacon (with a little oil or spray oil) and cook on medium heat.<br />
Remove bacon once cooked.</p>
<p>Add onions to the pot and cook until translucent.</p>
<p>Add in beans, tomato sauce, water, dark brown sugar, yellow mustard, chili powder, salt and pepper, and stir.</p>
<p>Bring to a boil then reduce to a simmer. Cook for 45-60 minutes (until thick)</p>

<p><strong>NON-ALCOHOLIC PATRIOTIC PUNCH</strong><br />
(Perfect following your patriotic pump workout.)</p>
<p>Ingredients:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://sculptnation.com/products/bcaas" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sculpt Nation Fruit Punch BCAAs</a> (prepared with water)</li>
<li>Blue Sports Drink (Zero calorie version)</li>
<li>Diet Sprite or 7-Up</li>
<li>Crushed ice</li>
<li>Regular ice cubes</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Instructions:</strong><br />
Fill up your cup all the way with ice cubes.<br />
Pour in your pre-made <a href="https://sculptnation.com/products/bcaas" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sculpt Nation BCAAs</a> (about ⅓ of the way)<br />
Add a few more ice cubes.<br />
Slowly pour a layer of blue Gatorade (about another ⅓ of the way up) directly over the ice cubes.<br />
Add crushed ice and slowly pour on the diet soda.</p>
<p>Using crushed ice should help keep the “colors” from mixing as much. It also gives the “white” to your red-white-blue drink theme!</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>Eating healthy on Cinco de Mayo Is Easier Than You Think</strong></em></p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-7080 aligncenter" src="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/CDM-blog-01-fb-vs.gif?resize=600%2C600&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="600" height="600" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>It is time for the ultimate #TacoTuesday … Cinco de Mayo 2020 is upon us!</p>
<p>If you are on a diet (or just trying not to gain the “Quarantine 15”) … you may think that a fiesta of tacos, tortillas, and tequila is off-limits.</p>
<p>No doubt, many standard Mexican dishes are full of calories, which could easily result in a dieting disaster!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>But you don&#8217;t have to skip the Cinco de Mayo festivities.</strong></em></p>
<p>Without all of the oils, sauces, and cheese, most of the ingredients that make up your favorite Mexican dishes are very waistline-friendly.</p>
<ul>
<li>Lean Meat</li>
<li>Fiber-Rich Beans</li>
<li>Rice</li>
<li>Vegetables</li>
<li>Salsa</li>
<li>Avocado</li>
<li>Herbs and Spices (like cilantro, chile peppers, etc.)</li>
</ul>
<p>The base for most Mexican cuisine is very diet-friendly! Which makes modifying your Cinco de Mayo spread super easy!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>Grab your sombrero…</strong></em><br />
<em><strong>We’ve got a Cinco de Mayo menu that will allow you to</strong></em><br />
<em><strong>enjoy the festivities and stay on track!</strong></em></p>
<p>Before we give you TEN different macro-friendly recipes, here is a Cinco de Mayo FUN FACT for ya … in case you want to impress your fiesta crew!</p>
<p><em><strong>Did you know</strong></em>… Cinco de Mayo (Spanish for “5th of May”) is not a Mexican holiday?<br />
Many people confuse it with Mexican Independence Day (that isn’t until September.)</p>
<p>Cinco de Mayo is actually a day that commemorates the Battle of Puebla when the Mexican army had victory over France during the Franco-Mexican War.</p>
<p>Except for the city of Puebla, where they celebrate with a military parade and mock battle, Cinco celebrations are pretty low-key in Mexico.</p>
<p>Americans, however, use the day as an excuse to eat tacos, bottomless bowls of chips and salsa and pound pitchers of margaritas!</p>
<p>I mean, we aren’t complaining… any excuse for some tacos and tequila, right?</p>
<p>Enough history&#8230; let the fiesta begin!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>HEALTHY CINCO MAIN DISHES</strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>LOW CARB FISH TACO BOWL</strong></span><br />
This bowl reminds us of a sunny day at the beach! It is so flavorful that you won’t even miss the carb-filled tortilla! We are using white fish, but you can substitute grilled chicken, salmon, or shrimp!</p>

<p>There really isn’t a special recipe here (however we are gonna give you one for some inspo.)</p>
<p>All you do is think of what you love in and on a burrito .. and throw it in a bowl instead of wrapping it in a carb-heavy flour tortilla!</p>
<p>With all the flavors and volume, you won’t miss the carbs! Plus, skipping out on rice or a tortilla means you save calories for an extra Skinny Margarita instead (recipe for that is below.)</p>
<p>Get creative and use your favorite lean protein, veggies, and garnishes!<br />
Here is how we like to make our bowl ….</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Bowl Ingredients:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Lean meat of choice (grilled chicken, lean shredded pork, lean steak, fish, shrimp, etc.)</li>
<li>Lots of shredded lettuce</li>
<li>Steamed cilantro lime rice, cauliflower rice, or quinoa.</li>
<li>Sauteed Fajita Veggies</li>
<li>Fajita Seasoning</li>
<li>Black Beans</li>
<li>Corn</li>
<li>Salsa</li>
<li>Pico</li>
<li>Guac</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Bowl Instructions:</span></p>
<p>Make your meat however you choose using seasonings that compliment Mexican fare!<br />
We are using a lean sirloin steak rubbed with a cilantro lime seasoning.</p>
<p>Make your steamed rice, cauli rice, or quinoa (add lime, cilantro, and salt for extra flavor.)</p>
<p>Sautee Veggies (we are using olive oil cooking spray, peppers, onions, and mushrooms)</p>
<p>Crack open a can of corn and black beans and heat them up on the stove or microwave.</p>
<p>Put a ton of shredded lettuce in a big bowl. Mix in some salsa, lime juice, and seasoning to give your lettuce a little extra flavor. Pile in all your ingredients. Mix up. Top with garnishes of choice…. dig in!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>SOUTHWEST CHICKEN QUESADILLAS</strong></span><br />
Typically we would tell you that a quesadilla should be a hard pass. At a restaurant, this carb-heavy menu staple is fried in oil and filled with hundreds of calories of cheese, with very little (and sometimes no) protein and veggies. But it is easy to give this typically high-calorie Mexican staple a healthy upgrade at home!</p>

<p>*Recipe makes 4 quesadillas*</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Ingredients:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>10 oz Raw Chicken Breast</li>
<li>4 small multi-grain tortillas, corn tortillas, or low carb wraps</li>
<li>¼ cup hummus of choice (we like red pepper, jalapeno, etc.)</li>
<li>½ cup chopped red onion</li>
<li>½ cup black beans</li>
<li>2 tbsp minced garlic</li>
<li>4 tbsp goat cheese</li>
<li>1 small sliced avocado</li>
<li>Fresh cilantro</li>
<li>Salsa or Pico</li>
<li>Coconut oil spray</li>
</ul>
<p>*optional for added protein and dipping*<br />
FF Greek Yogurt (great substitute for sour cream)</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Instructions:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>Spray a non-stick skillet with spray and heat on medium-high</li>
<li>Saute 1 tbsp minced garlic and onions. Add chicken (thinly sliced) and cook about 12-15 minutes or until fully cooked.</li>
<li>Spread hummus onto each of your tortillas.</li>
<li>On one side of your tortillas &#8211; evenly distribute your cooked chicken mixture, black beans, goat cheese, sliced avocado, and some fresh chopped cilantro.</li>
<li>Fold tortillas in half.</li>
<li>Spray skillet with oil and allow skillet to heat to medium heat.</li>
<li>Add quesadillas and cook (one at a time or however much space you have in the pan) for about 2 minutes per side.</li>
<li>Press down w/spatula, so they flatten out.</li>
</ol>
<p>Top with salsa and dip in greek yogurt!</p>
<p><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">** TIP **</span></em><br />
If you don’t like plain greek yogurt, try mixing in some lime juice, taco seasonings, smashed avocado, or even some low sugar ketchup (yes ketchup, don’t knock it till you try it.)</p>

<p>One of the quickest ways to eat a TON of calories in no time&#8230; is with chips and dips!</p>
<p>For “chips” … there are lots of baked versions you can purchase. But if you want to make your own tortilla chips, it is super simple!</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Tortilla Chip Ingredients:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Corn tortillas</li>
<li>Olive or Avocado Oil Spray (or a tiny bit of the actual oil)</li>
<li>Salt</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Tortilla Chip Instructions:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Heat oven to 350 degrees.</li>
<li>Cut corn tortillas into triangles.</li>
<li>Spray or lightly brush with oil.</li>
<li>Sprinkle on some salt.</li>
<li>Place on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper and bake about 10 minutes, or until crispy!</li>
</ul>
<p><em><strong>If you want to save some carbs, a great alternative to chips would be fresh veggies, like peppers, celery, and zucchini!</strong></em></p>
<p>For “dips”… salsa is always a safe choice, especially if you make your own at home.</p>
<p>Guacamole is another popular choice. While guac is made with healthy avocados, it is easy to overeat this delicious chip dipper!</p>
<p>But with a simple recipe trick, you can easily add “bulk” to your guacamole so you can<br />
enjoy more&#8230; for less!</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Skinny Guacamole Ingredients:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>1 large ripe avocado</li>
<li>1/4 cup coarsely chopped fresh cilantro</li>
<li>1/4 cup finely chopped onion</li>
<li>2 cloves garlic</li>
<li>2 tablespoons lime juice</li>
<li>1/2 teaspoon hot sauce</li>
<li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
<li>1 large zucchini cut into chunks OR 1 cup steamed peas</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Skinny Guacamole Instructions:</span></p>
<p>(zucchini version)</p>
<ul>
<li>Place the chopped zucchini in a microwave-safe bowl and cover with a damp paper towel. Microwave on high until tender (3-5 minutes.)</li>
<li>Drain any liquid by pressing lightly on the zucchini.</li>
<li>Let cool for about 5 minutes.</li>
<li>Add avocado, cilantro, onion, garlic, lime juice, hot sauce, and salt. Mash with a fork until combined.</li>
</ul>
<p>(pea version) *using peas will make the guac slightly sweeter*</p>
<ul>
<li>Lightly steam peas. Allow to cool and then mash by hand or place in a food processor and pulse until the peas are smooth.</li>
<li>Transfer peas into a large bowl and add the rest of the guacamole ingredients above, minus the zucchini (Adding both could work too. More veggies is never a bad thing.)</li>
<li>Mix well, mashing the avocado as you stir.</li>
</ul>

<p>Also known as Elote, this delicious corn dish was given the nickname “Mexican Street Corn” because it is a staple for street vendors in Mexico.</p>
<p>You can get fancy and make/serve it on a stick like they do .. or skip the stick .. and place it straight on the grill. If you don’t have a grill, you can also make the corn in the oven.<br />
Can’t find corn on the cob? Use canned or frozen corn, mix in the other ingredients, and serve it off the cob!</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Ingredients:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>4 medium corn on the cob (husked and silk removed)</li>
<li>¼ cup light or fat free mayonnaise</li>
<li>¼ cup fresh chopped cilantro</li>
<li>2 tbsp plain fat free greek yogurt</li>
<li>1 tsp fresh lime juice</li>
<li>1 tsp</li>
<li>½ tsp ancho chile powder</li>
<li>¼ tsp minced garlic</li>
<li>4 Tbsp cotija cheese (Can sub crumbled fat free feta for an even healthier version, see notes)</li>
<li>Olive oil cooking spray</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Instructions</span></p>
<ol>
<li>Preheat grill to medium.</li>
<li>Lightly spray corn with cooking spray.</li>
<li>Place corn on the grill, turning occasionally.</li>
<li>Cook until tender and slightly charred (10-15 minutes.)</li>
<li>While the corn is on the grill, combine all ingredients except the cheese in a small bowl.</li>
<li>When corn is ready, brush with the mixture and then sprinkle each ear with 1 Tbsp cheese. Add a few more shakes of chili powder for an extra kick!</li>
</ol>
<p>*While they both have a similar texture and mild salty flavor, feta cheese will not taste the same as cotija. Because feta is easy to find and comes in a fat free variety, it is a decent substitute that could serve as a lower-calorie option. Grated parmesan cheese could also be a substitute.</p>

<p>Mexican sangria is a traditional Spanish beverage that combines wine, fruit, sugar, and some spices. It is known to have a slightly higher alcohol content than Spanish sangria and pairs well with spicy foods!</p>
<p>We are gonna go a MUCH healthier route with a sangria “mocktail” that contains <a href="https://sculptnation.com/products/bcaas" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BCAAs</a>, making it a perfect post-workout treat! Because we know you are gonna get in a sweat session before your fiesta, right?</p>
<p>Ingredients:<br />
1 scoop <a href="https://sculptnation.com/products/bcaas" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sculpt Nation Fruit Punch BCAAs</a><br />
1 cup fruit of choice (examples: sliced blood oranges, sliced peaches, raspberries, strawberries, blueberries, etc. We love the combo of oranges, peaches, and strawberries.)<br />
4 oz diet ginger ale<br />
8 oz water</p>
<p>Instructions:<br />
Add water, a scoop of <a href="https://sculptnation.com/products/bcaas" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sculpt Nation BCAAs</a>, fruit, and ginger ale (in this order) to a shaker cup. Shake up and serve chilled!</p>
<p><em><strong>Why BCAAs?</strong></em><br />
For starters, they are delicious and add flavor to your drink for no added calories (you can’t say the same with typical fruit juices or sangria mixes.)</p>
<p>But they can also provide tons of recovery benefits! So if you take us up on our Cinco Tips (below) and get in a good training session before your fiesta… <em><strong>this Sangria recipe would be a great post-workout drink!</strong></em></p>
<p><a href="https://sculptnation.com/products/bcaas" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BCAAs</a> (or branched-chain amino acids) assist in helping you recover from your training sessions much faster. They provide exactly what your body needs to support getting into an anabolic state (muscle building and fat burning) &#8211; and help repair the damage training causes to your muscle fibers. <em><strong>Quicker recovery means&#8230; less muscle soreness!</strong></em></p>
<p>Faster recovery is only one perk of supplementing with <a href="https://sculptnation.com/products/bcaas" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">quality BCAAs</a>. The essential amino acids in our <a href="https://sculptnation.com/products/bcaas" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sculpt Nation blend</a> have been shown to assist with and support&#8230;</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>If none of these recipes entice your taste buds… there are plenty of healthy swaps you can make that will allow you to stick to your diet…</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>Here are some tips!</strong></em></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>ENJOY</strong></span><br />
<strong>Fresh Veggies</strong>: No limit here! Veggies are a great way to add “bulk” to your Cinco dishes. Just don’t cook them in a ton of oil. Steam or saute with cooking spray!</p>
<p><strong>Lean Meats</strong>: grilled chicken, white fish, shrimp, and even lean shredded pork loin! Load up on lean protein.</p>
<p><strong>Salsa</strong>: This condiment adds tons of flavor to your food and is very low in calories and carbs.<br />
If you are watching sodium, many store-bought salsas are super high in sodium! You can always make you own!</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">LIMIT</span></strong><br />
<strong>Tortillas</strong>: Opt for “thin” or mini street size tortillas. Another option is to mix things up. Have 1-2 tortillas, and for the rest of your tacos, use a lettuce wrap instead!</p>
<p><strong>Rice</strong>: Nothing wrong with rice! Just be mindful. This small grain can add up to some significant carbs! Also, pass on rice cooked in oil and use steamed rice flavored with things like lime juice and cilantro! If you want to add bulk to your rice, do a 50/50 mix of rice and cauli rice!</p>
<p><strong>Guacamole</strong>: Avocados are very healthy! But it can be easy to eat a full day’s worth of fat in one sitting of chips &amp; guac if you aren&#8217;t careful! Remember that even “healthy” foods have calories! If you want more “bulk,” try our lower fat guac recipe above.</p>
<p><strong>Fruit Based Salsa</strong>: This is another example of how healthy foods still have calories. There is nothing wrong with fruit, but keep in mind fruit based salsas do have more carbs.</p>
<p><strong>Low-Fat Cheese</strong>: The same rule applies here! Just be mindful! A sprinkle can go a long way in adding flavor to your dishes!</p>
<p><strong>Beans</strong>: This is another super healthy food that we encourage you to add to your dishes! Just keep in mind that beans do have a decent amount of both protein and fat and not ALL beans are healthy (skip the refried.)</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>PASS</strong></span><br />
<strong>Full Fat Cheese</strong>: Things like queso dip, etc.</p>
<p><strong>Anything Fried</strong>: Eat black beans instead of refried beans. Baked chips instead of fried chips. Soft flour or corn tortillas instead of crispy taco shells.</p>
<p><strong>Fattier Cuts Of Meat</strong>: Many Mexican restaurants use fatty cuts of beef, chicken thighs instead of breast, and pork shoulder instead of a leaner loin. Make sure you are using lean cuts of meat for your dishes.</p>
<p><strong>Sugary Pre-Mixed Drinks</strong>: Of course, alcohol has calories, but so do the sugary mixes you use to make your favorite margarita! Skip the pre-made mixes, or things like triple sec, and make your own using our recipe above. You should use caution with alcohol in general. It’s not just the “empty” calories in the drinks themselves, it’s also the temptation to make bad decisions after a few drinks kick in!</p>
<p><strong>OTHER TIPS</strong><br />
If you are going to support your local Mexican restaurant, when you order, you can make a few special requests to make your meal healthier!</p>
<p>Ask them to steam your vegetables, use light or no oil when cooking, pass on the cheese and refried beans, get ALL sauces on the side and use them in moderation, ask for lettuce wraps instead of tortillas, skip their rice (unless it’s steamed) and add your own at home, and instead of having them include their fried tortilla chips .. make your own using our recipe above.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Healthy or Modified…</em></strong><br />
<em>Make sure you put those calories to good use and get in a pre-Cinco lift!!</em><br />
<em>If you need some ideas, we have hundreds (for free) on our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/vshred" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">YouTube channel</a>!</em></p>
<p>If you decide to indulge and eat some non-modified fiesta foods, here are a few more ways you can lessen the “damage” from all the extra calories you consume!</p>
<ul>
<li>Plan your fiesta to be a “High Carb Day” &#8211; “Free Meal” &#8211; “ReFeed Day” &#8211; etc.</li>
<li>Plan your training split so that you work one of your lagging/larger body parts and get in a solid lift and cardio session before you indulge!</li>
<li>Go on a pre and post-meal walk to increase your daily <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12468415" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NEAT</a>.</li>
<li>Include a fat-burning thermogenic support supplement like <a href="https://sculptnation.com/products/burn">Sculpt Nation BURN</a> that helps naturally suppress appetite!</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://sculptnation.com/products/burn" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BURN</a> is different from many “fat burners” on the market. It’s so unique, we don’t even like to call it that. Most fat burners may help you burn a few extra calories, but it ends there. Any fat that is mobilized may still be in your blood waiting for a new place to live (like your stomach or thighs.)</p>
<p><a href="https://sculptnation.com/products/burn" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BURN</a> goes further .. it attacks your body fat from three essential pathways.. blasting fat cells from the inside out.</p>
<p>Even if you are choosing to lighten up your fiesta, <a href="https://sculptnation.com/products/burn" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BURN</a> is a great addition to your supplement stack because it goes beyond helping you burn calories. It helps support and raise your metabolic rate! Increasing your metabolic rate helps boost your body’s ability to burn fat for fuel!</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This protein-packed muscle-building chicken chili recipe is simple to make, healthy and tastes amazing!</p>
<h2>Quick and Easy Recipe for Muscle-Building Chicken Chili</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>Why is Chili Great for Muscle-Building?</strong></h3>
<p>The beef and beans in chili recipes are full of protein and low in calories and carbs. You can, however, replace the beef with chicken for <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/how-many-calories-should-i-eat-lose-weight/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">fewer calories</a> and more protein.</p>
<p>This recipe takes about 10 minutes to prepare and 25 minutes to cook. The ingredients listed below can make up to 10 small serving bowls of a protein-rich low-calorie hot meal.</p>
<h3><strong>Ingredients</strong></h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-5949 size-full" src="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Raw-chicken-breasts-on-cutting-board-chicken-chili-ss.jpg?resize=625%2C400&#038;ssl=1" alt="Ingredients | Winter Muscle-Building Chicken Chili" width="625" height="400" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Raw-chicken-breasts-on-cutting-board-chicken-chili-ss.jpg?w=625&amp;ssl=1 625w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Raw-chicken-breasts-on-cutting-board-chicken-chili-ss.jpg?resize=300%2C192&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<ul>
<li>15 oz chicken breast</li>
<li>1 tbsp olive oil</li>
<li>1 green bell peppers</li>
<li>1/2 cup mushroom</li>
<li>1 onion</li>
<li>1/4 cup corn</li>
<li>1 cup black beans</li>
<li>1 cup kidney beans</li>
<li>1 cup red beans</li>
<li>1 cup barley</li>
<li>1 tsp chili powder</li>
<li>1 clove garlic</li>
<li>1 tbsp parsley</li>
<li>1 tbsp cumin</li>
<li>2 tbsp Worcestershire sauce</li>
<li>15 oz crushed tomatoes</li>
<li>2 cups water</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Instructions</strong></h3>
<h3>Step 1: Prepare the Ingredients</h3>
<p>Clean the chicken and vegetables and place all of the ingredients onto your prep area. Slice the onions, bell peppers, and chicken breast into small strips so that they&#8217;re bite-sized.</p>
<h3>Step 2: Heat the Oil and Cook the Garlic</h3>
<p>Take a large pot and spray it with non-stick cooking spray to help make clean up a breeze later on. Put in the minced garlic and the olive oil. Add some water, and bring it to a boil over medium heat.</p>
<h3>Step 3: Add the Bell Pepper, Mushroom, and Onions</h3>
<p>Next, add the bell pepper, mushroom, and sliced onions into the pot. Stir and bring to a boil.</p>
<h3>Step 4: Boil Chicken and Beans in Tomato Sauce</h3>
<p>Take the chicken, corn, beans, barley, tomato and tomato sauce and pour everything into the pot. Stir the pot until everything is well mixed. Then cover the pot and let it boil. You can also add water to your desired consistency if the sauce is too thick.</p>
<p><strong>Thought:</strong> Chicken breasts are a lot leaner than beef which has more fat content. They are also an inexpensive alternative to beef.</p>
<p>There isn&#8217;t a lot of fiber in chicken which makes the black beans&#8217; high fiber content very important for digestion. Red and kidney beans are dense in carbs, protein, and fiber. 100 grams of it is equivalent to 24g of protein.</p>
<h3>Step 5: Season the Dish</h3>
<p>Once the tomato sauce is boiling, it&#8217;s time to season the dish with chili powder, parsley, cumin, and Worcestershire sauce. Put in a little at a time and have a taste until you get the right spiciness you want. If it gets too spicy for you, just add some water until you get the right taste.</p>
<p><b>Thought:</b> Worcestershire sauce contains less sodium which makes it a great alternative to salt and soy sauce for seasoning. It also has a mild sweetness that can complement the tomato sauce and chili powder.</p>
<h3>Step 6: Cover and Cook on Low Heat</h3>
<p>Decrease the temperature to a low heat and cook it for 25 minutes. Keep the pot covered to trap the steam inside and soften the chicken, mushrooms, corns, tomatoes, barley, and beans.</p>
<h3>Step 7: Top with Cheese and Serve Hot</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-5947 size-full" src="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/A-bowl-of-delicious-home-made-chili-chicken-chili-ss.jpg?resize=625%2C400&#038;ssl=1" alt="Top with Cheese and Serve Hot | Winter Muscle-Building Chicken Chili" width="625" height="400" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/A-bowl-of-delicious-home-made-chili-chicken-chili-ss.jpg?w=625&amp;ssl=1 625w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/A-bowl-of-delicious-home-made-chili-chicken-chili-ss.jpg?resize=300%2C192&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>Serve this protein-rich chicken chili dish in a bowl while it&#8217;s still hot. Prepare a serving and top it off with some low-fat cheddar cheese. If you reheat the dish after your muscle-building workout, reheat it with the cheese on top so that it will melt in with the chili sauce.</p>

<h3>Drinks to Lose Weight</h3>
<h3>7. Blueberry Banana Smoothie</h3>

<h3>8. Apple Cider Vinegar and Papaya Smoothie</h3>

To mask its acidity, add papaya slices to your cider smoothie and some crushed peppercorn.</p>
<h3>9. Coffee with Flax Seed and Dark Chocolate</h3>
<p>Caffeine is an active agent that induces weight loss. Combining this morning pick-me-up with flax seeds will help reduce inflammation and insulin resistance. The additional dark chocolate is great for taste but it also helps lengthen your satiety and prevent the digestion, synthesis, and absorption of fatty acids.</p>
<h3>10. Minty Green Tea</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-5508 size-full" src="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/mug-of-green-tea-and-teapot-weight-loss-recipes-ss.jpg?resize=625%2C400&#038;ssl=1" alt="Minty Green Tea | Weight Loss Recipes for Every Meal" width="625" height="400" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/mug-of-green-tea-and-teapot-weight-loss-recipes-ss.jpg?w=625&amp;ssl=1 625w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/mug-of-green-tea-and-teapot-weight-loss-recipes-ss.jpg?resize=300%2C192&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>Boil the green tea for 5 minutes before adding the mint leaves. Boil it again for another 5 minutes and then strain it. Green tea has properties that mobilize fat for weight loss while mint is filled with antioxidants and helps prevent you from having a common cold, allergies, gastritis, and irritable bowel syndromes.</p>
<h3>11. Toasted Coconut Protein Smoothie</h3>
<p><!-- instagram error: invalid instagram resource --></p>

<p>Celery contains no calories, which forces your body to burn more energy to properly digest and absorb it. It&#8217;s a great addition to weight loss recipes because it can boost lipid metabolism and lower bad cholesterol levels. Add in a tablespoon of apple cider vinegar to increase the smoothie&#8217;s weight loss benefits.</p>

<p>You can still enjoy eating the right amount of calories and protein with pumpkin spice protein shakes as well as pumpkin spice protein bars, which are often more popular options. For today, however, we will teach you how to make pumpkin spice protein pancakes to fill you up in the morning.</p>
<h2>How to Make Delicious Pumpkin Spice Protein Pancakes</h2>
<p><a href="https://sculptnation.com/product/protein-vanilla/?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=post&amp;utm_campaign=v-shred&amp;utm_content=pumpkin-spice-protein-Blog-Post-Vanilla-Protein&amp;utm_term=5"><img class="alignnone wp-image-4599 size-full" src="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Pumpkin-Pancake-with-Butter-Pumpkin-Spice-Protein-Pancakes.jpg?resize=625%2C615&#038;ssl=1" alt="Delicious Pumpkin Pancake | Pumpkin Spice Protein Pancakes" width="625" height="615" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Pumpkin-Pancake-with-Butter-Pumpkin-Spice-Protein-Pancakes.jpg?w=625&amp;ssl=1 625w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Pumpkin-Pancake-with-Butter-Pumpkin-Spice-Protein-Pancakes.jpg?resize=300%2C295&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Pumpkin-Pancake-with-Butter-Pumpkin-Spice-Protein-Pancakes.jpg?resize=60%2C60&amp;ssl=1 60w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h3>Ingredients:</h3>
<ul>
<li>2 eggs</li>
<li>1/2 cup pumpkin puree</li>
<li>1/2 tsp pumpkin pie spice</li>
<li>1/8 tsp baking powder (optional)</li>
<li><a href="https://sculptnation.com/product/protein-chocolate/"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>1</strong><strong> scoop Sculpt Nation Vanilla Protein Powder</strong></span></a></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> If you can’t find pumpkin pie spice at your local grocery store, you can simply blend cinnamon and nutmeg.</p>
<h3>Step 1: Make the Pancake Mixture</h3>
<p>Combine the eggs, pumpkin puree, pumpkin pie spice, baking powder, and protein powder in a large mixing bowl. Use a whisk to mix them together until they form a rich, creamy texture.</p>
<h3>Step 2: Prep the Cooking Pan</h3>
<p>Next, coat your frying pan with some non-stick cooking spray. Afterward, heat it over medium heat.</p>
<h3>Step 3: Fry the Pumpkin Spice Protein Pancake</h3>
<p>Add two to three tablespoons of the pancake mixture. Fry it for two minutes per side until bubbles form in the center, and the edges become crispy.</p>
<h3>Step 4: Adjust to Taste and Serve</h3>
<p>Don’t be afraid to add a few healthy fruits and berries on top to make the meal more satisfying. We suggest throwing in some fruits, nut butter, or honey for a more decadent taste. Serve immediately after cooking.</p>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> Store any leftovers in the refrigerator, or bring them with you to work as a healthy snack.</p>

<p>Instead of eating high-calorie junk like chips, candies, and cakes, opt to snack on some nutritious pumpkin pancakes instead. <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/healthy-snacking-snack-options/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Healthy snacking</a> is a great way to stay in track with your fitness goals.</p>
<p>Similarly, eating these pancakes is a great way to mix up your <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/what-eat-after-workout/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">post-workout routine</a>. They have enough protein, fats, and carbs to help your muscles recover as fast as possible.</p>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> Try to eat them within 30 minutes of finishing a workout. This timeframe is the anabolic window in which your muscles are most susceptible to utilizing nutrients you feed them. During this short period, the body switches from a catabolic to an anabolic state. Consuming enough nutrients during your anabolic window is important to ensure muscle growth.</p>

<p><strong>Calories:</strong> 300</p>
<p><strong>Cooking Time:</strong> 40 minutes</p>
<p>One popular way to eat healthily is to stick to a paleo diet. Many quick lunch recipes have paleo-friendly alternatives.</p>
<p>For example, instead of making a high-carb chicken sandwich, you can opt for a Chinese-style chicken salad. It’s high in fiber, protein, and minerals, which can help your body <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/pre-workout-meal-for-more-energy-quick-healthy-recipe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">maintain peak performance</a> both inside and outside the gym.</p>
<p>Plus, if you prepare the vinaigrette beforehand, it only takes 10 minutes to toss the ingredients together. It’s one of the best healthy lunch options for fitness buffs who want to start a paleo diet but don’t know much about cooking.</p>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> To make things easier, prepare about a week’s worth of chicken salad over the weekend, then store them in your refrigerator for later. Pack them cold so that they’re still fresh when lunchtime comes.</p>
<p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>4 cups savoy cabbage, shredded</li>
<li>1 cup carrot, sliced</li>

<li>1/4 cup radishes, sliced</li>

<li>1/2 fresh lemon, juiced</li>
<li>1 tsp. fresh ginger, grated</li>
<li>2 tbsp. sesame oil</li>
<li>1 tsp. raw honey</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How to:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Toss the scallions, cabbage, carrots, and radish in a large bowl.</li>
<li>Top it with chicken, mint, and cilantro then set the salad aside so you can make the vinaigrette.</li>
<li>Remove the seeds from the chipotle pepper, place it in a small bowl, and then cover with warm water for 30 minutes.</li>

<h3>7. Broccoli and Chicken Thigh Recipe</h3>
<p><strong>Calories:</strong> 450</p>
<p><strong>Cooking Time:</strong> 30 minutes</p>
<p>When coming up with good lunch recipes, many fitness buffs dismiss chicken thighs and go straight for the breast. While breasts have fewer calories, the thighs contain more phosphorous, calcium, and potassium.</p>
<p>This broccoli and chicken thigh recipe is one of the best easy healthy lunches that utilize the thigh’s higher nutritional value. Plus, we&#8217;re not adding any unnecessary calories to the meal, since broccoli has few of them to begin with.</p>
<p>It’s a great alternative for gym-goers sick of eating easy healthy lunch recipes made of chicken breast. Cook a few meals in advance, then store them in the refrigerator for a quick and healthy paleo lunch on the go.</p>
<p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>12 boneless, skinless chicken thighs</li>
<li>2 cups broccoli florets</li>
<li>1 cup light chicken stock</li>
<li>2 tbsp. balsamic vinegar</li>
<li>1 tbsp. Dijon mustard</li>
<li>Salt</li>
<li>Pepper</li>
<li>1 tbsp. tapioca starch</li>
<li>2 tbsp. coconut oil</li>
<li>1 tsp. chili pepper flakes</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How to</strong>:</p>
<ol>
<li>Scrub the chicken with salt and pepper.</li>
<li>Place a large skillet pan over high heat then melt the coconut oil.</li>
<li>Cook the chicken for around eight minutes, flipping them about halfway through. Place the chicken on a plate then set aside.</li>
<li>Without removing the coconut oil and chicken juice, cook the broccoli over medium heat for around five minutes until they soften.</li>
<li>While waiting for the broccoli to soften, mix the vinegar, mustard, chicken stock, chili flakes. tapioca starch, and mustard in a large bowl.</li>
<li>Pour this over the broccoli then cook for another two minutes until it boils.</li>
<li>Throw in the chicken thighs in the saucepan and put some sauce over it.</li>
<li>Remove from heat then let it stand for five more minutes.</li>
<li>Serve and enjoy.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Calories:</strong> 400</p>
<p><strong>Cooking Time:</strong> 15 minutes</p>

<p>If you’re craving for Japanese food, this grain-free, keto-friendly sushi recipe is perfect for you. It’s a modern take on traditional sushi where we remove the rice –which means it has way fewer carbs and more protein.</p>

<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-3941 size-full" src="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/What-Makes-a-Good-Post-Workout-Snack-post-workout-cookie-recipe01.jpg?resize=625%2C625&#038;ssl=1" alt="What Makes a Good Post-Workout Snack | 5-Ingredient Gluten-Free Cookies for a Post-Workout Snack | oatmeal chocolate chip protein cookies" width="625" height="625" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/What-Makes-a-Good-Post-Workout-Snack-post-workout-cookie-recipe01.jpg?w=625&amp;ssl=1 625w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/What-Makes-a-Good-Post-Workout-Snack-post-workout-cookie-recipe01.jpg?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 150w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/What-Makes-a-Good-Post-Workout-Snack-post-workout-cookie-recipe01.jpg?resize=300%2C300&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/What-Makes-a-Good-Post-Workout-Snack-post-workout-cookie-recipe01.jpg?resize=60%2C60&amp;ssl=1 60w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>The main reason we strongly suggest trying this post-workout cookie recipe is it has most of the nutrients you need for muscle recovery. During the first 30 minutes <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/what-to-eat-after-a-workout/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">after a workout</a>, your body switches from a catabolic to an anabolic state.</p>
<p>This means it needs at least enough protein and carbs to <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/how-to-gain-muscle-mass/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">maximize muscle growth</a>. It’s also the reason many fitness buffs take protein shakes after their workouts.</p>
<p>If you’re looking for a snack to eat in place of protein shakes, this easy <span>low-carb protein cookie recipe</span> is what you need. It has protein and carbs but does not contain any gluten.</p>
<p>This means most of the nutrients you consume will help build your muscles. None of them will turn to fat. Plus, our post-workout cookie recipe is definitely healthier compared to other snacks.</p>
<h3>Why Diets Fail</h3>
<p>One common reason diets fail is that people tend to snack too much. Not just after their workouts, but also in between meals.</p>
<p>Since it may be a bit difficult to completely stop snacking, you should find another way around it. What you can do is try healthier options like this protein cookie recipe.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Remember that the key to having a rocking body is to maintain a healthy balance between your workouts and <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/easy-healthy-meals-quick-healthy-recipes-for-breakfast/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">your diet</a>. You don’t need to give up sweets and snacks completely. All you need are healthier options that suit both your wants and needs.</p>
<p>So what are you waiting for? Grab an apron and try out this easy, delicious post-workout cookie recipe.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you’re looking for an easy stir-fry recipe, try making this chicken and veggies stir-fry. Some meat and veggie stir-fry dishes can be high in sodium because of the hoisin, oyster, or soy sauce in the dish.</p>
<p>This healthy stir-fry recipe uses only herb seasonings to add flavor to your dish. Read on to find out how to cook this delicious and healthy chicken meal!</p>
<h2>Healthy Chicken and Veggies Stir-Fry</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span style="color: #000080;">Ingredients:</span></h3>
<ul>
<li>2 tbsp of olive oil</li>
<li>450 grams of boneless skinless chicken breasts</li>
<li>2 cups of broccoli</li>
<li>1 large zucchini</li>
<li>1 medium bell pepper</li>
<li>1 medium yellow onion</li>
<li>3-4 cloves garlic minced or crushed</li>
<li>1 tbsp Italian seasoning</li>
<li>1 tsp salt</li>
<li>½ tsp black pepper</li>
</ul>
<h3><span style="color: #000080;">Step 1: Clean and Cut Chicken</span></h3>
<p>Clean up the chicken before you start. Wash it and cut off any unwanted fats, then cut the chicken breasts into half-inch-thick slices.</p>
<p>You may also lightly season the chicken with some salt and pepper before you prepare the vegetables.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #000080;">Step 2: Prepare the Vegetables</span></h3>
<p>Wash all of the vegetables and then cut them into small pieces. The broccoli needs to be sliced into bite-sized florets, the zucchini into small slices, and the bell pepper and yellow onion into half-inch-thick slices.</p>
<p>You should also mince or crush the garlic cloves before you start cooking.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #000080;">Step 3: Stir-Fry the Chicken and Veggies</span></h3>
<p>Heat the oil in a large skillet under medium to high heat. Then add the chicken, veggies, garlic, and spices. Cook for about 10 minutes, stirring occasionally until the veggies are soft and tender and the chicken cooked through.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #000080;">Step 4: Season to Taste</span></h3>
<p>Taste the vegetables to find out if there’s enough seasoning. Season the dish to your taste before serving. You may also try experimenting by adding low-sodium soy sauce to make it taste more authentic.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #000080;">Step 5: Serve and Enjoy!</span></h3>

<p><a href="https://vshred.com/blog/weight-loss-with-apple-cider-vinegar/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Apple cider</a> is a must-have when you are trying to detox and lose weight. Having an apple cider detox drink helps in fighting inflammation and building immunity, while also lowering cholesterol levels. But be warned, its taste isn&#8217;t very palatable.<br />
<img class="alignnone wp-image-1977 size-full" src="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/apple-smoothie.jpg?resize=625%2C417&#038;ssl=1" alt="Best Detox Drinks For Weight Loss | Apple Cider Vinegar and Papaya Smoothie | apple cider detox drink" width="625" height="417" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/apple-smoothie.jpg?w=625&amp;ssl=1 625w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/apple-smoothie.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px" data-recalc-dims="1" /><br />
To get your daily dose, consider adding it into your smoothies to mask the acidity. Gather the following ingredients to create this drink:</p>
<ul>
<li>3 tablespoons apple cider vinegar</li>
<li>papaya, sliced and cubed</li>
<li>3 black peppercorns, crushed</li>
</ul>
