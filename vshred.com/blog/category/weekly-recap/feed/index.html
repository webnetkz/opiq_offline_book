IT band stretches can help relieve pain when there is an inflammation of the muscles surrounding the IT band. Too much running and other rapid activities can increase tension in the IT band, which causes pain in the hip or knees. To relieve the pain, you have to stretch the muscles around your IT band. Additionally, strengthening the hip will also help balance the muscles surrounding the IT band, which will also decrease tension.
