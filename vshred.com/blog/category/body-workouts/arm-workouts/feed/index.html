								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When I’m specifically trying to gain strength or size through my entire body, I rotate through this 5-day workout routine.</p>
<p>In this article:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="#chest">Day 1: Chest</a></li>
<li><a href="#back">Day 2: Back</a></li>
<li><a href="#legs">Day 3: Legs</a></li>
<li><a href="#arms">Day 4: Arms</a></li>
<li><a href="#shoulders">Day 5: Shoulders</a></li>
</ol>
<h2>5 Day Weekly Workout Routine</h2>
<p>When I prescribe workouts for my clients, I always make sure I’ve done each and every one of the exercises as well as the routine itself to make sure it works the muscles I want to be working, to make sure it’s set at the proper difficulty, and to make sure I’ve done a run through for when questions arise. I do change up my workout routines from time to time, but in general, my <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/weight-training-beginners/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">weight training</a> stays relatively consistent.</p>
<p>Based on the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) guidelines for resistance training, if you’re trying to gain strength or size, it’s ideal to hit each major muscle group at least twice a week. <strong>Major muscle groups include chest, core, arms, shoulders, back, and legs.</strong> Because of these guidelines, I have a couple of different routines I go through. Below is one of my primary weekly routines.</p>

<p>In addition to my weekly routine of weight training, all of my lifting is followed up by at least 20 minutes of <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/full-cardio-workout-done-in-only-4-minutes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cardio</a>. I’ll generally do <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/hiit-workout-plan-burn-calories-in-4-minutes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HIIT training</a> if it’s only 20-25 minutes of cardio. Anything that hits 30 minutes of cardio generally entails more steady-state cardio. I aim to get at least 2 miles on the treadmill during my cardio sessions.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Are you struggling to build bigger arms? Read on for the top five workouts to get big arms fast.</p>
<h2>Bigger Arms Workouts | Surefire Ways to Get Stronger Arms</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>1. Straight Bar Curls</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-4554 size-full" src="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Straight-Bar-Curls-bigger-arms.jpg?resize=625%2C349&#038;ssl=1" alt="Straight Bar Curls | The Top 5 Workouts For Bigger Arms" width="625" height="349" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Straight-Bar-Curls-bigger-arms.jpg?w=625&amp;ssl=1 625w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Straight-Bar-Curls-bigger-arms.jpg?resize=300%2C168&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>One of the best arm workouts is the straight bar curls. It&#8217;s a no-fuss exercise that fully engages the biceps. Here&#8217;s how to do it:</p>
<ul>
<li>Grab a barbell using an underhand grip and let it hang just below your waist. This will be your starting position.</li>
<li>While keeping your elbows tucked in at the sides, curl the bar all the way up stopping just under your chin.</li>
<li>Afterward, slowly lower the weight back down to the starting position.</li>
<li>Do 5 sets of 15 to 20 reps.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> Remember that <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/bicep-curl-fix/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">straight bar curls</a> are slow, controlled movements. Squeeze for maximum contraction in the biceps whenever you bring the bar up. Do not swing the bar using your hips. Instead, slowly lift the weight up while contracting your biceps.</p>
<h3>2. Hammer Curls</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-4555 size-full" src="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Hammer-Curls-bigger-arms.jpg?resize=625%2C351&#038;ssl=1" alt="Hammer Curls | The Top 5 Workouts For Bigger Arms" width="625" height="351" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Hammer-Curls-bigger-arms.jpg?w=625&amp;ssl=1 625w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Hammer-Curls-bigger-arms.jpg?resize=300%2C168&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>The hammer curl is a great dumbbell workout that isolates the long head of your bicep. If you pay close attention to your arms, you’ll see the separation between the triceps and biceps during this exercise. Here are the steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Grab a dumbbell in each of your hand.</li>
<li>While keeping the upper arms stationary, slowly curl the weight up.</li>
<li>Once at the top, squeeze your biceps for one count before carefully lowering the weight back down.</li>
<li>Do 5 sets of 15 to 20 reps.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> Hammer curls are not about how heavy your dumbbells are. Rather, they’re about getting the reps in properly and squeezing your biceps at the top.</p>
<h3>3. Concentrated Curls</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-4556 size-full" src="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Concentrated-Curls-bigger-arms.jpg?resize=625%2C348&#038;ssl=1" alt="Concentrated Curls | The Top 5 Workouts For Bigger Arms" width="625" height="348" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Concentrated-Curls-bigger-arms.jpg?w=625&amp;ssl=1 625w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Concentrated-Curls-bigger-arms.jpg?resize=300%2C167&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>Concentrated curls are exactly what the name says — concentrated. These are slow, controlled movements where your aim is to draw in as much blood as possible to the inner head of your bicep. Do not swing the weight up and down while doing this exercise.</p>
<ul>
<li>First, sit down on a flat bench with a dumbbell in front of you. Place your right elbow on your right thigh and pick up the weight. This will be your starting position.</li>
<li>Slowly curl the weight up while keeping your upper arms stationary. Once at the top, squeeze your biceps at the peak before lowering the weight back down.</li>
<li>Do 5 sets of 12 to 15 reps on each arm.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> To really get bigger arms, aim to create a flow with your arm movements. The goal is to get a pump at the peak inner head of your bicep. Remember: hit the peak and concentrate it!</p>
<h3>4. Triceps Extensions</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-4557 size-full" src="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Triceps-Extensions-bigger-arms.jpg?resize=625%2C351&#038;ssl=1" alt="Triceps Extensions | The Top 5 Workouts For Bigger Arms" width="625" height="351" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Triceps-Extensions-bigger-arms.jpg?w=625&amp;ssl=1 625w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Triceps-Extensions-bigger-arms.jpg?resize=300%2C168&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>If you want bigger arms, you need to hit all your arm muscles, including your triceps. When doing triceps extensions, many gym-goers mindlessly swing the weight up and down.</p>
<p>However, the proper way to do it is to squeeze your triceps at the bottom while pulling the cable down. Follow these steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>First, stand in front of the cable triceps extension machine, grab the cable, then pull the weight down.</li>
<li>Remember to pull the weight all the way down until your arms are fully extended. Once at the bottom, squeeze your triceps before releasing.</li>
<li>Also, don’t let the cable carry your arms on the way up. Instead, slowly release the weight until your elbows bend at about 90 degrees.</li>
<li>Do 5 sets of 15 to 20 reps.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> After working on the biceps, get the blood flowing to the triceps: The keyword here is extension, so make sure to fully extend and squeeze your triceps.</p>
<h3>5. Close Grip Tricep Extensions</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-4558 size-full" src="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Close-Grip-Tricep-Extensions-bigger-arms.jpg?resize=625%2C349&#038;ssl=1" alt="Close Grip Tricep Extensions | The Top 5 Workouts For Bigger Arms" width="625" height="349" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Close-Grip-Tricep-Extensions-bigger-arms.jpg?w=625&amp;ssl=1 625w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Close-Grip-Tricep-Extensions-bigger-arms.jpg?resize=300%2C168&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>For this exercise, you can use a barbell or a cable machine. We’ll be using a cable since it takes the tension off your elbows.</p>
<ul>
<li>Stand in front of the machine and pull the cable up behind your neck. Your elbows should point away from your body. This will be your starting position.</li>
<li>Next, push the weight up over your head until your arms are fully extended. Once at the top, remember to squeeze your triceps before releasing the weight down to the starting position.</li>
<li>Do 5 sets of 15 to 20 reps.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> Remember, you should feel the tension in your triceps, not your forearms, elbows, or shoulders.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Bicep Curl Mistakes and Tips to Effectively Target Your Biceps</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div id="what" class="anchor">
<h3><strong>What Are Bicep Curls?</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/9SJafYiFjfcG6nSoGH"><img src="https://i0.wp.com/media.giphy.com/media/9SJafYiFjfcG6nSoGH/giphy.gif?resize=480%2C270&#038;ssl=1" alt="Animated GIF - Find &amp; Share on GIPHY" width="480" height="270" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>Bicep curls are upper body exercises for <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/best-bicep-workout-fix-for-bigger-arms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">strengthening the biceps</a> and forearm muscles. The movement involved in this exercise engages these muscles and continuously strains them to promote muscle growth. However, as with any exercise, form plays an important role here. This is how you do a proper bicep curl:</p>
<ul>
<li>Stand straight with feet hip-width apart. Fully extend the arm with a little bend on the elbows.</li>
<li>Hold the dumbbells on both hands.</li>
<li>Do a curl on your right arm by lifting the dumbbell toward the right shoulder.</li>
<li>Lower it down and lift with your left arm.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div id="avoid" class="anchor">
<h3><strong>2 Things to Avoid When Doing a Bicep Curl</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/3LxMSy4kDEAsYBUeOL"><img src="https://i0.wp.com/media.giphy.com/media/3LxMSy4kDEAsYBUeOL/giphy.gif?resize=480%2C270&#038;ssl=1" alt="Animated GIF - Find &amp; Share on GIPHY" width="480" height="270" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>When you’re doing bicep curls, you are contracting the biceps and that should be where the main engagement is. Making mistakes during this exercise will take away the focus from your biceps and engage other muscles, like the traps. This makes the exercise less effective.</p>
<div id="momentum" class="anchor"></div>
<h3>1. Creating Unnecessary Momentum</h3>
<p>When you’re working out with dumbbells that are too heavy, after a few reps, your muscles will start to fatigue. When that happens, your form starts to go, and you start creating momentum. This is when you rock your arms back and forth before doing the curl. However, this momentum isn’t something you want to do, and it won&#8217;t help you complete a clean set of reps without being forced to <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/top-5-workout-mistakes-youre-making-how-to-avoid-them/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">commit another mistake</a>.</p>
<div id="shrugging" class="anchor"></div>
<h3>2. Shrugging the Weight Up</h3>
<p>The big mistake here is when you&#8217;re shrugging the weight up. When you&#8217;re lifting heavier weight than you should, you might not get enough clean reps in there, which makes you desperate in lifting that weight up. So, you use every muscle group to get that weight as high up as possible without realizing that you&#8217;re no longer targeting your biceps but engaging your traps instead. It&#8217;s not just about lifting that weight; it&#8217;s doing it properly that counts.</p>

<div id="drop" class="anchor"></div>
<h3>1. Drop the Weight</h3>
<p>Instead of creating momentum, which is counterproductive, to bring the bicep curl upwards, drop the heavy weight you&#8217;re lifting. Use dumbbell weights you can actually control. This way, you can focus on proper form and not shrug the weight up.</p>
<div id="shoulders" class="anchor"></div>
<h3>2. Press Your Shoulders Down</h3>
<p>What you should do is press your shoulders down as far as you can and keep them down throughout the whole rep. Imagine that you’re standing up straight while trying to pick up something on the floor that’s out of your reach. When your shoulders are positioned correctly, you can now do the bicep curls.</p>
<p>This will keep you from creating momentum because it forces your whole body to stay in place. At the same time, when you’re pulling your shoulders down, you’re also refraining from shrugging the weight upward. Pulling your shoulders down will isolate your biceps, which is the only muscle you want to engage in this exercise.</p>

<p>When you’re aiming to do a particular number of reps for your <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/bicep-workout-bigger-arms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">bicep workouts</a>, focus on a number that you can execute correctly. If you&#8217;re aiming for 10 reps, aim for 10 clean reps. Don’t do 3 clean reps, then shrug the weight up in the next 7 and call it a good set, it isn&#8217;t. Whether you&#8217;re working with dumbbells, barbells, or cables, drop the weight, focus on your form, and complete a set with clean reps. Remember that to stimulate the biceps properly, you must practice the proper form, no excuses.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ladies, are you looking for a quick and easy arm workout that will really give your biceps and triceps the burn they need? It&#8217;s no joke to attempt burning the fat on your arms, let alone build and tone your arm muscles. All it takes is 5 minutes a day to start working on your goal and say goodbye to flabby arms.</p>
<h2>7 Arm Workout Exercises You Can Do at Home</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Use a Yoga Mat</h3>
<p>Most of these <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/arm-workouts-for-bigger-biceps-triceps-8-arm-exercises/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">arm workout exercises</a> can be done while standing up, but some exercises will require you to lay or sit on the floor. Have a yoga mat on the floor to help lessen the pressure on your hands and knees.</p>
<h3>1. Bicep Curls</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-3803 size-full" src="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/fitness-sport-bodybuilding-and-weightlifting-concept-close-up-of-young-woman-and-personal-trainer-with-dumbbells-arm-workout-ss.jpg?resize=625%2C400&#038;ssl=1" alt="Bicep Curls | Easy Arm Workouts For Slim And Toned Arms | arm workout with dumbbells" width="625" height="400" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/fitness-sport-bodybuilding-and-weightlifting-concept-close-up-of-young-woman-and-personal-trainer-with-dumbbells-arm-workout-ss.jpg?w=625&amp;ssl=1 625w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/fitness-sport-bodybuilding-and-weightlifting-concept-close-up-of-young-woman-and-personal-trainer-with-dumbbells-arm-workout-ss.jpg?resize=300%2C192&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>A bicep curl is an isolation movement that engages the muscle running from the shoulder to the forearm or the biceps. It also engages the smaller muscles that assist the movement of the biceps, the brachioradialis, and the brachialis. This exercise is great for those who really want to get rid of their flabby arms.</p>
<p><strong>How to do a bicep curl:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart and your arms at your side.</li>
<li>Close your fists and lock your elbows against your body.</li>
<li>Then curl your arms upwards towards your chest.</li>
<li>After doing a curl, return to the starting position (with the elbows straight down) and do the bicep curl again.</li>
<li>Do this exercise repeatedly for 30 seconds.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Tip: </strong>To burn the fat in your arms, add some resistance to this exercise by using a pair of dumbbells.</p>
<h3>2. Forward Arm Circles</h3>
<p>Forward arm circles are a great exercise for players of tennis, volleyball, and baseball. It’s a dynamic exercise that works out the muscles on your shoulders. You can also use it as a warm-up for upper body workouts.</p>
<p><strong>How to do forward arm circles:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Stand with your arms stretched out to make a T-formation, with your feet shoulder-width apart.</li>
<li>Make sure your palms are facing the floor.</li>
<li>Rotate your arms forward in a circular motion.</li>
<li>Do this exercise continuously for 30 seconds.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> Want to take it up a notch? Do this exercise with dumbbells.</p>
<h3>3. Reverse Arm Circles</h3>
<p>Reverse arm circles are the counterpart of the previously mentioned exercise. It focuses on the same muscles and warms up the upper body before a workout session.</p>
<p><strong>How to do reverse arm circles:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Stand with your arms stretched out to your sides to make a T-formation, with your feet shoulder-width apart.</li>
<li>With your palms facing the floor, rotate your arms backward in a circular motion.</li>
<li>Do this exercise continuously for 30 seconds.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> Add more resistance to this workout by using a pair of dumbbells.</p>
<h3>4. Overhead Press</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-3804 size-full" src="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Young-athletic-woman-exercising-outdoors-overhead-press-for-upper-body-strength-arm-workout-ss.jpg?resize=625%2C400&#038;ssl=1" alt="Overhead Press | Easy Arm Workouts For Slim And Toned Arms | arm workout routine" width="625" height="400" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Young-athletic-woman-exercising-outdoors-overhead-press-for-upper-body-strength-arm-workout-ss.jpg?w=625&amp;ssl=1 625w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Young-athletic-woman-exercising-outdoors-overhead-press-for-upper-body-strength-arm-workout-ss.jpg?resize=300%2C192&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>An overhead press is a compound exercise that will engage both your biceps, triceps, and <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/5-deltoid-exercises-to-strengthen-and-sculpt-your-shoulders/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">deltoid muscles</a>. Usually, this exercise is done with barbells or dumbbells, but you can still get the engagement even without the equipment.</p>
<p><strong>How to do an overhead press:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Stand with your arms up (aligned to the shoulders), with the feet hip-width apart. Make sure the elbows are bent at 90 degrees. This is the starting position</li>
<li>Exhale and slowly push your arms up over your head until your arms fully extended, feel your own body resistance working here.</li>
<li>Inhale and bring it back down to the original position, and repeat.</li>
<li>Do this exercise repeatedly for 30 seconds.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Tip: </strong>If you opt to use a pair of dumbbells for this exercise, go for something that will tire your muscle after 12 lifts. Ideally, you can start with 5 pounds.</p>
<h3>5. Knee Push-ups</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-3692 size-full" src="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Young-attractive-woman-doing-Warming-up-practicing-Exercises-for-chest-arms-and-shoulders-knee-Push-ups-or-press-ups-arm-workout-ss.jpg?resize=625%2C400&#038;ssl=1" alt="Knee Push-ups | Easy Arm Workouts For Slim And Toned Arms | arm workouts at home" width="625" height="400" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Young-attractive-woman-doing-Warming-up-practicing-Exercises-for-chest-arms-and-shoulders-knee-Push-ups-or-press-ups-arm-workout-ss.jpg?w=625&amp;ssl=1 625w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Young-attractive-woman-doing-Warming-up-practicing-Exercises-for-chest-arms-and-shoulders-knee-Push-ups-or-press-ups-arm-workout-ss.jpg?resize=300%2C192&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>Push-ups are a great addition to any upper body workout. It engages pectoral muscles and triceps. A knee push-up lessens the pressure on your joints and upper body.</p>
<p><strong>How to do a knee push up:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>On the yoga mat, start with your hands and knees on the ground. Your hands should be under your shoulders with your elbows fully extended. You can choose to cross your feet or not for this exercise.</li>
<li>While keeping the back straight, lower your elbows until your chin almost touches the floor.</li>
<li>Raise your body and repeat.</li>
<li>Do as much for this exercise as you can within 30 seconds.</li>
</ul>
<h3>6. Floor Triceps Dips</h3>
<p>Triceps dips help tone the back of your arms or your triceps. It’s a compound movement often done with an elevated foundation, but you can also do this exercise on the floor.</p>
<p><strong>How to do a floor triceps dip:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Sit on the mat with your knees bent and your feet on the floor.</li>
<li>Then put your hands on the mat behind you (right under the shoulders), with your fingers pointing at your hips. The elbow will be fully extended here.</li>
<li>Bend your elbows back and then lift yourself up until the elbows are completely extended and your hips are way off the ground.</li>
<li>Bring the elbows back down but still keeping your rear off the mat, and then lift yourself up again.</li>
<li>Do as much for this exercise as you can within 30 seconds.</li>
</ul>
<h3>7. Plank</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-3691 size-full" src="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Perfect-plank.-Full-length-side-view-of-young-beautiful-woman-in-sportswear-doing-plank-arm-workout-ss.jpg?resize=625%2C400&#038;ssl=1" alt="Plank | Easy Arm Workouts For Slim And Toned Arms | arm workouts without weights" width="625" height="400" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Perfect-plank.-Full-length-side-view-of-young-beautiful-woman-in-sportswear-doing-plank-arm-workout-ss.jpg?w=625&amp;ssl=1 625w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Perfect-plank.-Full-length-side-view-of-young-beautiful-woman-in-sportswear-doing-plank-arm-workout-ss.jpg?resize=300%2C192&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>A <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/the-worst-ab-exercise-ever-stop-this-today/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">static plank</a> is one of the best arm workouts that’ll test your endurance. When doing this exercise, it’s important to keep your body straight the whole time.</p>
<p><strong>How to do a plank:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Lie on your belly with your toes pressing against the ground.</li>
<li>Your elbow must be under your shoulders, bent at a 90-degree angle. You can rest the weight on your forearms.</li>
<li>Lift your body and make sure your body forms a straight line from the head all the way to the feet.</li>
<li>Hold this position for 30 seconds without letting your hips sag down.</li>
<li>If you can do 30 seconds with ease, feel free to challenge yourself and hold the position longer the next time around.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you’re looking to tone your arms, these simple arm exercises at home can help you with that. While you may opt to do this workout without any equipment, an arm workout with dumbbells (like for bicep curls) will provide better results. Keep in mind that you need to work on arm strengthening exercises to remove saggy fat and replace it with muscles. Add this 5-minute arm exercise into your weekly arm workout routine and you&#8217;ll see slimmer and shapely arms soon enough.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Both men and women search everywhere for the best arm workouts. That’s because nothing beats the pump you get after a few solid reps of arm exercises. In addition, they’re a great way to improve strength and boost muscle-growth in your limbs. Check out these top seven arm exercises with weights you should definitely try!</p>
<h2>Best Arm Workouts for Bigger, Leaner Biceps and Triceps</h2>
<h3><span style="color: #000080;">1. Barbell Bicep Curls</span></h3>
<p><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/41gOk8XKlx6yjOjRxS"><img src="https://i1.wp.com/media.giphy.com/media/41gOk8XKlx6yjOjRxS/giphy.gif?resize=480%2C270&#038;ssl=1" alt="Animated GIF - Find &amp; Share on GIPHY" width="480" height="270" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><a href="https://vshred.com/blog/easy-bicep-curl-fix-for-bigger-arms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Barbell bicep curls</a> are one of the most basic <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/best-arm-workouts-with-dumbbells-for-bigger-arms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">arm workouts with dumbbells</a>. It’s probably one of the first exercises you learned after you signed up for a gym membership.</p>
<p><strong>Pro tip:</strong> If you want to challenge yourself, you can incorporate Arnold Schwarzenegger’s pyramid training technique to your bicep curls.</p>
<ul>
<li>Stand straight and place a loaded EZ curl bar in front of you.</li>
<li>Lift the barbell up using an underhand grip. Let it hang in front of you with your arms extended.</li>
<li>Slowly lift the weight up toward your chest by curling your arms. Keep upper arms stationary.</li>
<li>Lower the weight back down gently to the starting position.</li>
<li>Do three sets of 12 to 15 reps.</li>
</ul>
<h3><span style="color: #000080;">2. Dumbbell Overhead Extension</span></h3>
<p><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/8YHkwXptMpw8Ul5QhL"><img src="https://i0.wp.com/media.giphy.com/media/8YHkwXptMpw8Ul5QhL/giphy.gif?resize=480%2C270&#038;ssl=1" alt="Animated GIF - Find &amp; Share on GIPHY" width="480" height="270" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>This exercise helps you build lean muscle mass in your triceps. It&#8217;s a great dumbbell exercise that is fairly easy to execute.</p>
<ul>
<li>Stand up straight near a dumbbell rack. Make sure the dumbbell you plan to use is within reach.</li>
<li>Pick up the weight using both hands and lift it above your head.</li>
<li>Keep your palms facing upward with your arms and elbows close to your head. This will be your starting position.</li>
<li>Lower the weight down behind your head with your elbows at about a 90-degree angle while keeping your upper arms stationary.</li>
<li>Push the weight back up. You should feel your triceps contracting.</li>
<li>Do three sets of 12 to 15 reps.</li>
</ul>
<h3><span style="color: #000080;">3. Dumbbell Bicep Curls</span></h3>
<p><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/lo5hq89QPIzLuqMEbv"><img src="https://i1.wp.com/media.giphy.com/media/lo5hq89QPIzLuqMEbv/giphy.gif?resize=480%2C270&#038;ssl=1" alt="Animated GIF - Find &amp; Share on GIPHY" width="480" height="270" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>Both dumbbell and barbell bicep curls are great exercises to build arm mass. However, some people feel comfortable curling more weight using dumbbells since their wrists are free to rotate. With a barbell, your wrists are locked in one position throughout the exercise.</p>
<ul>
<li>Stand up straight while holding a dumbbell in each hand. Make sure your palms are facing in. This will be your starting position.</li>
<li>Keep your upper arms stationary then curl the weight up while rotating your wrists forward.</li>
<li>Slowly lower the weight back down to starting position.</li>
<li>Do three sets of 12 to 15 reps.</li>
</ul>
<h3><span style="color: #000080;">4. Hammer Curls</span></h3>
<p><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/feiNMX9AaWAHPbBr12"><img src="https://i0.wp.com/media.giphy.com/media/feiNMX9AaWAHPbBr12/giphy.gif?resize=480%2C270&#038;ssl=1" alt="Animated GIF - Find &amp; Share on GIPHY" width="480" height="270" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>The main difference between hammer curls and dumbbell bicep curls is how you grip the bar throughout the curl. This difference in form is also what allows you to curl heavier loads with hammer curls.</p>
<ul>
<li>Stand up straight with a dumbbell in each of your hand. Your palms should be facing your torso.</li>
<li>Lift the weight up while keeping your elbows in the same place.</li>
<li>Slowly lower the weight back down to the starting position.</li>
<li>Do three sets of 12 to 15 reps.</li>
</ul>
<h3><span style="color: #000080;">5. Overhand Barbell Curl</span></h3>
<p><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/oNTCd1sjvUE7B1lObI"><img src="https://i1.wp.com/media.giphy.com/media/oNTCd1sjvUE7B1lObI/giphy.gif?resize=480%2C270&#038;ssl=1" alt="Animated GIF - Find &amp; Share on GIPHY" width="480" height="270" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>While barbell curls target the biceps brachii, overhand barbell curls exercise the brachialis. They’re the small muscle that connects the bicep to the forearm.</p>
<ul>
<li>Stand up straight while holding a loaded barbell using a pronated grip.</li>
<li>Curl the weight up to your chest while keeping your upper arms stationary.</li>
<li>Slowly lower the weight back down.</li>
<li>Do three sets of 12 to 15 reps.</li>
</ul>
<h3><span style="color: #000080;">6. Close-Grip Bench Press</span></h3>
<p><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/5T0xI4ZEk9dm9sE2Af"><img src="https://i0.wp.com/media.giphy.com/media/5T0xI4ZEk9dm9sE2Af/giphy.gif?resize=480%2C270&#038;ssl=1" alt="Animated GIF - Find &amp; Share on GIPHY" width="480" height="270" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>This is an excellent exercise that builds muscle and improves strength in your triceps. It’s fairly easy to do and most people are not afraid to go heavy with this exercise.</p>
<ul>
<li>Lie down on a flat bench with a loaded bar above you.</li>
<li>Use a close grip to grab the bar just inside of shoulder-width.</li>
<li>Lift the bar up from the rack and keep your arms fully extended. This will be your starting position.</li>
<li>Slowly lower the weight down until just before touching your chest. Make sure to keep your elbows close to your torso to ensure that your triceps are the primary mover, not your pectorals.</li>
<li>Push the weight back up to the starting position.</li>
<li>Do three sets of 12 to 15 reps.</li>
</ul>
<h3><span style="color: #000080;">7. Lying Triceps Press</span></h3>
<p><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/cRMgAPmlwqWFPd8ydt"><img src="https://i0.wp.com/media.giphy.com/media/cRMgAPmlwqWFPd8ydt/giphy.gif?resize=480%2C270&#038;ssl=1" alt="Animated GIF - Find &amp; Share on GIPHY" width="480" height="270" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>The lying triceps press is a strength-training exercise that takes some practice to master. It’s also known as the skullcrusher or lying triceps extension.</p>
<p>Make sure to do this exercise with a weight you are comfortable with. Don’t force yourself to use dumbbells that are too heavy.</p>
<ul>
<li>Lie down on a flat bench. Make sure there’s a loaded EZ bar behind your head which is within reach or have someone hand you one.</li>
<li>Grab the weight from behind using a pronated grip. Lift it up until your arms are fully extended. Keep your elbows tucked in and bring the bar out above you at an angle to engage your triceps.</li>
<li>Slowly lower the weight down by bending your elbows until your elbows just pass 90 degrees.</li>
<li>Lift the weight back up to the starting position.</li>
<li>Do three sets of 12 to 15 reps.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Arm Workout with Dumbbells for Bigger Arms</h2>
<h3><span style="color: #000080;">1. Dumbbell Tricep Press with Seated Hammer Curls</span></h3>
<ul>
<li>This workout is similar to a normal chest press.</li>
<li>While laying down, bring your hands to a neutral position with your hands facing your wrists and your palms positioned towards each other.</li>
<li>Drop your elbows towards your sides.</li>
<li>Make sure that your elbows are aligned with your chest and abs.</li>
<li>Do not go down too low, stop at about 90 degrees then press back up.</li>
<li>Always ensure you squeeze your tricep on your way up to make the workout as effective as possible.</li>
<li>Do this ten times.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Seated Hammer Curls</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>This exercise can be done either alternately with each arm, or simultaneously, depending on your personal preference.</li>
<li>Do not swing your arms. Always ensure that your shoulders are stable.</li>
<li>Squeeze your bicep going up, and slowly control it going down.</li>
<li>Do this ten times.</li>
<li>After the set, rest for 1 minute.</li>
</ul>
<h3><span style="color: #000080;">2. Dumbbell Skull Crushers with Supinated Curls</span></h3>
<p>Skull crushers are a great overhead extension workout, follow the tips below to learn how to do it:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lay flat on your back.</li>
<li>Hold the dumbbells in your hands with your palms facing up.</li>
<li>Make sure to stop at 90 degrees with your elbows, then press up.</li>
<li>Keep your elbows in an inward motion, then squeeze up with your tricep.</li>
<li>Do this ten times.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Supinated Curls</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>This workout is similar to the seated dumbbell curl, only this time you need to face your palms forward and twist your wrists to maximize the lengthening and shortening of the bicep.</li>
<li>Make sure you roll your shoulders back before starting the workout and stick out your chest, then curl up</li>
<li>Keep your elbow and shoulders in the same spot. This can either be done alternately or simultaneously depending on your preference.</li>
<li>Do this ten times on each arm, and make sure to control both arms on your way up and down.</li>
<li>After completing the workout, take a 1-minute rest.</li>
</ul>
<h3><span style="color: #000080;">3. Dumbbell Overhead Extensions with Concentration Curls</span></h3>
<ul>
<li>While seated, make sure to keep your back as straight as possible.</li>
<li>Straighten your arms almost above your head, then bring it back and pulled together.</li>
<li>Make sure to squeeze your elbow as you perform each motion.</li>
<li>Do this 10 times.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Concentration Curls</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Using a strong seated position, rest your arm against your leg.Make sure to use your leg as a point of support so you can use your bicep to perform the curl.</li>
<li>Make sure that all motions are controlled as possible when going up and down.</li>
<li>Do 10 this ten times on each side, with a 1 minute break time.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Take note that your triceps and biceps need to be fully engaged throughout all dumbbell workouts listed. Do not disengage at any point in the exercise, because you could be taking away a lot of leverage in the routines.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A lot of rear delt exercises are done with the wrong form. You may see people working on their delts at the gym by creating momentum and taking tension away from the muscle (which is incorrect). Keep reading to learn how to do a proper machine and dumbbell reverse fly exercise!</p>
<h2>Rear Delt Exercises and Their Proper Form</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>What is the Rear Delt Muscle</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-3074 size-full" src="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/thrust-dumbbells-slope-rear-deltoid-3d-tricep-exercises-ss.jpg?resize=625%2C298&#038;ssl=1" alt="What is the Rear Delt Muscle | Killer Rear Delt Exercises (Fix Your Form!) | Deltoid workout" width="625" height="298" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/thrust-dumbbells-slope-rear-deltoid-3d-tricep-exercises-ss.jpg?w=625&amp;ssl=1 625w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/thrust-dumbbells-slope-rear-deltoid-3d-tricep-exercises-ss.jpg?resize=300%2C143&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>To effectively target your rear deltoid muscle, you need to know where it is. It’s the muscle on the back of your shoulder, that runs along the scapula and inserts into the humerus, or upper arm bone.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #000080;">1. Single-Arm Cable Reverse Fly</span></h3>
<p><iframe class="giphy-embed" src="https://giphy.com/embed/oFMurfrzWnW7DjPVIW" width="480" height="270" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/oFMurfrzWnW7DjPVIW">via GIPHY</a></p>
<p>The unilateral cable reverse fly will teach you how to evenly stimulate the rear delt muscles as you&#8217;re working out each shoulder. This exercise targets a single arm at a time, which is perfect for people whose <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/bicep-workout-bigger-arms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">arms aren’t evenly strong</a> or built. It’ll help stimulate one rear deltoid to catch up with the other.</p>
<p><strong>How to:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Grab the cable with your arm stretched out across your chest.</li>
<li>Bring out the cable while keeping your arm straight and shoulders rolled forward.</li>
<li>Stop when your arm is parallel to the body.</li>
<li>Then bring the cable back across the chest.</li>
<li>Do 4 sets of 12 reps for each arm.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Tip: </strong>Avoid shrugging the shoulders to keep the focus on the rear delts rather than the traps.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #000080;">2. Reverse Machine Fly</span></h3>
<p><iframe class="giphy-embed" src="https://giphy.com/embed/8hYOMlm3RDsTze54TV" width="480" height="270" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/8hYOMlm3RDsTze54TV">via GIPHY</a></p>
<p>This second reverse fly exercise will help you to consistently stimulate both rear deltoid muscles at the same time. The machine requires both arms to move at the same time, which helps workout both arms simultaneously with the same amount of weight.</p>
<p><strong>How to:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Roll your shoulders forward when grabbing the weight in front of you.</li>
<li>Then bring out the bars to the side until they’re parallel to the shoulders.</li>
<li>Bring them back together but don&#8217;t let them rest.</li>
<li>Do 4 sets of 12 reps.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Tip: </strong>Always keep your shoulders rolled forward to really keep the tension on the rear deltoids.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #000080;">3. Chest-Supported Dumbbell Reverse Fly</span></h3>
<p><iframe class="giphy-embed" src="https://giphy.com/embed/BNaWxw1mXMQtdv8Jkr" width="480" height="270" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/BNaWxw1mXMQtdv8Jkr">via GIPHY</a></p>
<p>A chest-supported dumbbell reverse fly will stimulate both rear delts muscles without creating momentum with your legs. This is great for anybody looking to get strict with their form. Which is necessary to build muscle!</p>
<p><strong>How to:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Lie down on the bench on your chest with a dumbbell in each hand.</li>
<li>Then roll your shoulders forward and lift the dumbbells to the side almost to parallel to the shoulders.</li>
<li>Bring it back down until they’re a foot apart to avoid a cheated rest.</li>
<li>Do 4 sets of 12 reps.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Tip: </strong>Don’t let your arms hang straight down to keep the tension on your deltoid muscles.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #000080;">4. Bent Over Reverse Dumbbell Fly</span></h3>
<p><iframe class="giphy-embed" src="https://giphy.com/embed/1isg0ew2ApJVuaiTJa" width="480" height="270" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/1isg0ew2ApJVuaiTJa">via GIPHY</a></p>
<p>This reverse dumbbell fly will use all of the stimulation techniques from the other reverse fly exercises.</p>
<p><strong>How to:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Sit down on a bench with a dumbbell in each hand.</li>
<li>Bend over until your chest is just above your knees and roll your shoulders forward.</li>
<li>Push the weight outwards and stop when your arms are parallel with your body.</li>
<li>Bring it back down with the dumbbells just a foot apart.</li>
<li>Do 4 sets of 12 reps.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Tip: </strong>Always roll your shoulders forward throughout the whole movement. Avoid creating momentum with your legs and don’t push out too far because you’ll lose tension in the muscles.</p>

]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Looking for more effective tricep exercises for your workout? These dumbbell exercises are great for working out all of your tricep heads. You may have seen people doing them at the gym, but often with the wrong form. Read on to learn how to properly do these tricep exercises at home or at the gym.</p>
<h2>Dumbbell Tricep Exercises at Home and the Gym</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span style="color: #000080;">1. Seated Overhead Triceps Extension</span></h3>
<p><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/seated-overhead-triceps-extension-1zhszhFAu88C0mjJWR"><img src="https://i0.wp.com/media.giphy.com/media/1zhszhFAu88C0mjJWR/giphy.gif?resize=480%2C270&#038;ssl=1" alt="Seated Overhead Triceps Extension GIF - Find &amp; Share on GIPHY" width="480" height="270" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><br />
This one of the most common tricep exercises you’ll find people doing at the gym. However, more often than not, their form is incorrect, which may lead to injury.</p>
<p>Their elbows are flared out, moving them in different positions as they lift, which presses against their elbow joints. They bring the dumbbells all the way down and up causing them to lose tension in their triceps.</p>
<p><strong>How to:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Hold one head of the dumbbell behind your head with both of your hands.</li>
<li>Start with your elbows bent at 90 degrees and tucked at the side of your head.</li>
<li>Bring the dumbbell up, keeping your elbows still tucked beside your head without locking them. Then slowly bring it back down to just below 90 degrees to not lose the tension.</li>
<li>Do 4 sets of 10-12 reps.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Tip: </strong>Focus on keeping your elbows tucked in as much as possible. Also, keep in mind to squeeze out your triceps without locking out your elbows when you extend.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #000080;">2. Seated Dumbbell Kickback</span></h3>
<p><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/vy0dSbGvjFKZQfqFHI"><img src="https://i2.wp.com/media.giphy.com/media/vy0dSbGvjFKZQfqFHI/giphy.gif?resize=480%2C270&#038;ssl=1" alt="Animated GIF - Find &amp; Share on GIPHY" width="480" height="270" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><br />
A seated dumbbell kickback exercise is a great tricep exercise. However, if done wrong, you cannot get the full workout you&#8217;re going for which will make it ineffective.</p>
<p><strong>How to:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Hold the dumbbell in one hand and sit on down on a bench.</li>
<li>Lean forward while keeping your back straight until your shoulders are just above your knees.</li>
<li>Drive your elbows up as high as you can and leave them in that position.</li>
<li>Extend your arm out towards your back until your arm is straight.</li>
<li>Then bring back the dumbbell until your elbows are bent. Do not curl it too much because you will already be working the biceps creating unwanted momentum as you swing backward.</li>
<li>Do 4 sets of 10-12 reps.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> Do not use heavy weights. Use a weight you can control to avoid creating momentum. The momentum will take away the tension from your triceps.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #000080;">3. Dumbbell Crossbody Extensions</span></h3>
<p><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/2WGKqArWb7afuiYP0R"><img src="https://i0.wp.com/media.giphy.com/media/2WGKqArWb7afuiYP0R/giphy.gif?resize=480%2C270&#038;ssl=1" alt="Animated GIF - Find &amp; Share on GIPHY" width="480" height="270" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><br />
This exercise is a great workout for the outer head of your tricep because of the internal rotation of your shoulder.</p>
<p><strong>How to:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Lay down on a bench and hold the dumbbell above your chest with your arm extend slightly to the inner side of your body.</li>
<li>Bring your elbow across your chest until your elbow is bent at a 90-degree angle.</li>
<li>Then bring it back up while keeping your elbow in the same position.</li>
<li>Do 4 sets of 10-12 reps.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Tip: </strong>Avoid locking out at the top when you’re doing the full arm extension. This will let the tricep head relax. Instead, focus on bringing your elbows across your body to keep your triceps engaged.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #000080;">4. Lying Dumbbell Skullcrushers</span></h3>
<p><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/83akwNGQbFwULXope0"><img src="https://i2.wp.com/media.giphy.com/media/83akwNGQbFwULXope0/giphy.gif?resize=480%2C270&#038;ssl=1" alt="Animated GIF - Find &amp; Share on GIPHY" width="480" height="270" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><br />
A skull crusher exercise usually requires a bar, but you can also do this exercise with a pair of dumbbells.</p>
<p><strong>How to:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Lie down on a bench with a pair of dumbbells in your hands.</li>
<li>Raise the dumbbells until your arms are extended over your head, but not directly above it. Bring your elbows further back to create a better angle to keep your triceps engaged.</li>
<li>Then bring the dumbbells down just below your head keeping your elbows in the same spot.</li>
<li>Bring it back up and start again.</li>
<li>Do 4 sets of 10-12 reps.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Tip: </strong>Avoid resting at the bottom of the movement and stop just below 90 degrees. Be sure to keep your elbows in the same spot throughout the whole exercise.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>For a demonstration, watch this video from our youtube channel V Shred:</strong></p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='1170' height='659' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/rj0eWvZ4Deo?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></p>
<p>Simple mistakes like elbow placement can ruin your <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/9-best-tricep-exercises-for-building-lean-muscle/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">triceps workout routine</a>. Always keep your triceps engaged without letting it rest with every movement.

<p class="p1">Bigger arms is one of the most sought out goals when it comes to fitness. But actually getting your biceps to fill out your sleeves and get those veins sticking out is easier said than done.</p>
<h4 class="p1">If you’re ready to say goodbye to the struggles of small arm land and build serious bicep muscle, it’s time to put down the muscle magazines, <a href="https://vshred.com/sp/survey/survey-aka1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">learn your body type with this free body type quiz</a> and start doing the best bicep workout fix today!</h4>
<p class="p1">This workout fix is great for any kind of bicep exercise, such as dumbbells curls, cable curls, EZ bar curls, etc. But in this video, I will be using the face curl for my example.</p>
<p class="p1">The reason I am using the face curl is because the face curl is a great way to target the “peak” of the bicep. This is also known as the “short head” of the bicep muscle.</p>
<h2 class="p1">The Best Bicep Workout Mistake</h2>
<p class="p1">You see, the biggest mistake you can make when doing bicep exercises, is going too heavy. By going too heavy, you are preventing yourself from achieving full range of motion.</p>
<p class="p1">But this is not to say you’re not getting the full stretch of the muscle. That part is no problem. All you have to do is let the weight straighten your arm.</p>
<p class="p1">Instead, you are not able to get the “peak” contraction of the muscle because you can’t properly lift it all the way up.</p>
<h3 class="p1">The Best Bicep Workout Fix</h3>
<p class="p1">In order to correct years of doing this on accident, you can simply incorporate a bicep curl additive to achieve this “peak” contraction.</p>
<p class="p1">To do this, you will do, what I call, the “triple-pump bicep curl”. This is when you set up into bicep curl position and using a lighter weight you will curl the weight towards you.</p>
<p class="p1">Now instead of lowering the weight back down to the original starting position, you will go half-way down and curl back up. You will repeat this 2 more times and then lower it all the way down.</p>
<p class="p1">Therefore, you will have curled the weight all the way up, gotten the “peak” contraction four times, and fully extended the muscle by lowering the weight all the way back down.</p>
<h4 class="p1">The Conclusion</h4>
<p class="p1">If you are someone who has struggled with packing on bicep muscle, it very well could be because you’re not getting the full range of motion. So by incorporating the “triple-pump bicep curl” you will put extra emphasis on the “peak” contraction, allowing for more gains!</p>
