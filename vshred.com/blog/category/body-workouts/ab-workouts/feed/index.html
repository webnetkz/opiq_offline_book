<p>Being a father is no doubt a blessing, but not always for your body. The demands of family life often mean a dad’s personal health becomes less of a priority.</p>
<p>Family duties aside, just being a man, in general, has a mound of pressures.</p>
<p>From the need to be successful, to the “act tough and hide weakness” mentality that guys are often taught.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>Society places a lot of responsibilities on men and data shows</strong></em><br />
<em><strong>you agree that it’s not good for you.</strong></em></p>
<p>A recent survey revealed that most men believe the pressures society places on them are unhealthy … with <em><strong>54% citing WEIGHT GAIN as their number one DAILY concern.</strong></em></p>
<p>Once you add “dad” to the list .. these pressures add up even more .. which usually results in putting health and fitness on the back burner.</p>
<p>Going to the gym and eating healthy falls to the bottom of the priority list.</p>
<p>So you shrug it off and embrace the “dad bod” look.</p>
<p>When the words dad bod went viral a few years ago (implying this was a physique women preferred) &#8211; guys worldwide celebrated!</p>
<p>But is this body type what women really prefer? Probably not.</p>
<p>Even more, is it a physique that makes YOU feel good? Also, not likely.</p>
<p>If you are confident with your expanding waistline .. that is great! You should love the skin you&#8217;re in ….</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>But you can’t ignore the health issues that come with having a dad bod physique.</strong></em></p>
<p><a href="https://sculptnation.com/products"><img class="size-full wp-image-7256" src="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_302233816.jpeg?resize=1170%2C781&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1170" height="781" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_302233816.jpeg?w=7360&amp;ssl=1 7360w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_302233816.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_302233816.jpeg?resize=768%2C513&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_302233816.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_302233816.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_302233816.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1170px) 100vw, 1170px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>The primary feature of a “dad bod” is an overall soft physique with very little muscle and a midsection that carries quite a bit of excess fat.</p>
<p>This type of belly fat is called Visceral Fat and can be very dangerous to your health.</p>
<p>Maybe your significant other tells you they like the extra cushion .. and perhaps you are totally fine with rocking a beer belly .. but it is important to keep in mind that storing a bit of extra fat around the midsection isn&#8217;t great for long term health.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>To be a good spouse and father .. you must take care of yourself.</strong></em></p>
<p>After all, you want to have the energy needed to respond to these pressures, right? Even more, I’m sure you want to enjoy life with your family!</p>
<p>Not to mention .. kids often mimic their parent’s behaviors. When a father figure is health-focused, it’s more likely the entire family will follow in his footsteps! By making your health a priority, you can be a fantastic role model in your home!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>There is no better time than Father’s Day ..</strong></em><br />
<em><strong>to remind yourself that YOU (and YOUR health) matters!</strong></em></p>
<p>To get rid of the fat that is a defining feature of dad bod .. you need to build muscle and drop body fat.</p>
<p>The best way to lose overall body fat is to focus on weight-training and throw in some high-intensity interval training cardio. It would help if you also established a lifestyle centered around proper nutrition.</p>
<p>Then you will want to focus on ab training at least a few days a week.</p>
<p>While you can’t “spot reduce” belly fat .. you must tone the muscles underneath so that once you start shedding pounds .. you will have a six-pack to reveal!</p>
<p>One of the best ways to train abs is through circuit training. It’s fast-paced .. which means your heart rate is more elevated. So, in addition to strengthening your core, circuits get you into a fat-burning zone.</p>
<p>I put together an <strong>8 MINUTE KILL YOUR DAD BOD AT HOME AB WORKOUT</strong> for all the busy dads out there. It only requires body weight and can be done from anywhere.</p>
<p>We aren’t suggesting you workout ON Father’s Day .. unless you want to. Relax! It’s your day!<br />
Hit the golf course, get outside and play with your kids, enjoy a big steak dinner, and save this killer 8 Minute Ab Workout for later!</p>

<p>I’m sure you often preach to the mom of your household that she needs to take care of herself.</p>
<p>You probably tell your kids that they need to eat their veggies, and you likely encourage them to participate in sports that keep them active and healthy .. but what about you?</p>
<p>Spend a little time this Father’s Day, reflecting on the ways you can take better care of yourself!</p>

<p>We’ve got some <em><strong>good news</strong></em> and some <em><strong>bad news</strong></em> about getting six-pack abs. The good news is it doesn’t take much time to get in a killer ab workout. But the bad news is you can train your midsection every single day, and your abs still may never show very much.</p>
<p><strong>WHY?</strong><br />
You can’t spot-reduce fat. This means that visible abs can’t be achieved from ab exercises alone. Most people have to have really low levels of body fat for their six-pack to be revealed, and getting that lean requires full-body training and proper diet. Factor in genetics and your body type, and the reality is that some people are just more likely to develop visible abs than others.</p>
<p>It is still important that you work on developing your ab muscles so that when your body fat does get low enough, you will be able to see them pop! But in addition to aesthetics, having strong abs is vital because the core is just that, the core of your entire body!</p>
<p>Most movements originate or move through your core. This means that a weak core can impact how well things like your legs and arms function. Having a strong core can benefit you by</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Helping Prevent Injury</strong></li>
<li><strong>Help With Your Balance &amp; Stability</strong></li>
<li><strong>Improve Back Pain</strong></li>
<li><strong>Result In Better Posture</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Now that we’ve talked about why it’s important to have a strong core, let&#8217;s talk about a specific area of the abs that many people have trouble isolating, lower abs. Those bottom couple of abs that make up the “six-pack” are the hardest to be revealed.</p>
<p>Technically, we should point out that there is no such thing as “lower” and “upper” abs in terms of human anatomy. The front six-pack of abs you see are the rectus abdominis muscles. They run from the base of the sternum to the pubic bone. They are split into left and right halves, but not into upper and lower halves. So you can’t only work your lower abs because there is no such thing as “lower abs.” With that being said, you can do some specific exercises that seem to <strong>target the lower half of your abs</strong> more than other ab exercises. <strong>Here is a quick ab workout guaranteed to make your abs feel the burn.</strong></p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">4 Minute Lower Ab Workout</h2>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="size-full wp-image-6392 alignnone" src="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/RC-GIF.gif?resize=480%2C270&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="480" height="270" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Exercise #1: Reverse Crunches</strong><br />
[15 SECONDS]</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="size-full wp-image-6393 aligncenter" src="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/MC-GIF.gif?resize=480%2C270&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="480" height="270" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Exercise #2: Mountain Climbers</strong><br />
[15 SECONDS]</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="size-full wp-image-6394 aligncenter" src="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/LLE-GIF.gif?resize=480%2C270&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="480" height="270" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Exercise #3: Leg Lift Extensions</strong><br />
[15 SECONDS]</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><b>REST FOR 15 SECONDS THEN REPEAT WORKOUT A TOTAL OF FOUR TIMES.</b></p>
<p>When performing these moves, you must prioritize quality over quantity. Merely going through the crunching or lifting motion is a complete waste of time when training abs! You also want to make sure you are mixing up your ab training. Keep in mind that people who have defined lower abs work their entire core, not just one area. The difference between them and those of us that do not have a perfectly carved out midsection is that they have less body fat in the abdominal area.</p>
<p><strong>Ready to give this workout a try? Follow along with Vince for the full 4-minute lower ab shredding workout in this video!</strong></p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='1170' height='659' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/j12Z1OxL--0?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></p>
<p>If washboard abs are your focus, you are going to have to trim body fat. You can’t do that from ab training alone. Nutrition plays an enormous role. So does total-body training that is meant to reduce overall body fat.</p>
<p>I get it, getting that last layer of fat off so your abs can show is difficult with diet and training alone. So if you want to <strong>attack belly fat on three key fronts and get rid of it forever</strong> you’re gonna need some help. See, belly fat is ultra stubborn. To root that fat out of its hiding place (your cells) you need a specific blend of nutrients that act like bunker-busting bombs, blowing fat out of its stronghold, and leaving it vulnerable to being incinerated in your bloodstream. <a href="https://sculptnation.com/burn/"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Click Here to discover how (only click if you want rapid results)</strong></span></a></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It doesn’t matter if you are just starting your fitness journey, or if you are an elite athlete, there is one thing that EVERYONE seems to want … <strong>KILLER ABS! </strong>It may seem like crunches and sit-ups are “one-size-fits-all,” but your abs are just like any other muscle group, which means how you train them will need to be slightly different based on your fitness level.</p>

<p><strong>ONE MORE THING ….</strong></p>
<p>It is common for people to focus on one area of the body where you want to see improvement or dwell on stubborn fat that doesn’t seem to go away no matter how hard you try! If you aren’t seeing the results you want when it comes to your midsection, try not to be so hard on yourself! <strong>The mid-section is a trouble spot for MANY people.</strong> Even the leanest individuals typically need to have really low levels of body fat for their six-pack to really pop. Genetics, torso-length, hormones, and your body type are just a few things that could make it more difficult for you to both develop and reveal your six-pack.</p>
<p>Even if you were born in the shallow end of the gene pool when it comes to having abs, you can actually overcome your DNA and reprogram your metabolism to scorch belly fat rapidly. But, <strong>ONLY IF you give your body the thermogenic support it needs</strong> to reverse your sluggish metabolism and set belly fat cells ablaze. <a href="https://sculptnation.com/burn/"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Click Here to discover how!</strong></span></a></p>

]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>These workouts for abs and core can give a better-toned body, flexibility, and support.</p>
<h2>Workouts for Abs and Core | Combine These Exercises for Better Body Strength and Support</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Why You Need to Do Core and Abs Exercises</h3>
<p><!-- instagram error: invalid instagram resource --></p>
<p>Many people perform workouts for abs and core without fully understanding their benefits. When they think of abs, they immediately picture a <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/how-get-six-pack-abs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ripped six-pack</a> or shredded obliques. The overall chiseled look is what many men and women dream of having.</p>
<p>What people often fail to realize is that the abs and core are relevant in keeping the body functional and healthy. Whether you know it or not, you use these all day long. You even need them in routine tasks such as sitting upright and walking.</p>
<p>People also believe when they do <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/abs-workout-home/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">abs workouts</a>, they are already exercising the core. The core includes not only the abdominals. It also involves the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rectus abdominal muscles</li>
<li>Internal and external obliques</li>
<li>Transverse abdominal muscles</li>
</ul>
<p>These are just muscles in front of the body. The core also covers those in your back such as multifidus muscle and erector spinae. The last forgotten part is the pelvic floor.</p>
<h3>The Dangers of Poor Abs Exercise</h3>
<p>It&#8217;s essential to include core exercises in a routine that work all these muscles. Doing a thousand crunches as workouts for abs and core may make you feel like you&#8217;re working toward that shredded ab look we see in movies and magazines. In reality, it creates muscle imbalances.</p>
<p>These types of abs exercises can also lead to the synergistic dominance of muscles. It can translate into imbalances of muscles and overcompensation when trying to perform specific exercises. These imbalances and overcompensations are dangerous. They can result in prolonged injury.</p>
<h3>Try These Exercises for Your Workouts for Abs and Core</h3>
<p><!-- instagram error: invalid instagram resource --></p>
<p>When including the core in your abs workouts, try some of the examples below. This combination of these core and abs exercises can help balance the work between anterior (front side of the body) muscles and posterior (back side of the body) muscles. You can also include the pelvic floor.</p>
<p>Design your workouts for abs and core with these exercises. Perform each at least once for 30 seconds:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Planks: </strong>Planks are a great way to work the entire core in one movement.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Bird Dogs:</strong> It can incorporate balance and core work in one action. To add a proprioceptive (knowing where your body is at in space) element, try closing your eyes while performing this exercise.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Dead Bugs:</strong> It is a preferable exercise if you have a <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/what-causes-lower-back-pain-workout/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">history of back pain</a> or injury. It is excellent in working the core and taking the pressure off the back.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Side Planks: </strong>It incorporates the often-forgotten obliques. The side planks focus in <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/3-exercises-for-abs-best-oblique-exercises-for-a-six-pack/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">on the obliques</a> as the primary muscle used to stabilize the body. The other previously mentioned muscles kick in to do the secondary stabilization work.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Supermans:</strong> It is a great way to hit the posterior core muscles. It lets you focus on the concentric (squeezing) part of this exercise.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Combining Core Workouts with Lifts</h3>
<p>Dedicated workouts for abs and core is vital to strengthen the muscles in the lower torso. What many people don’t know is they can also engage the core when they’re doing primary lifts:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Front Squats: </strong>If you’re <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/how-to-do-squats-exercises-for-knee-pain/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">doing this exercise</a> correctly, you are engaging the core during the entire movement. Make sure the chest is staying up. The back should also not be arching. You should be able to feel your core working during this lift.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Unsupported Shoulder Press: </strong>When you’re not using a bench to support your back, a shoulder press is a great way to engage the core while working the deltoids. Make sure to grab a weight that isn&#8217;t too heavy. Your core should have to work, but do not arch the back. You shouldn&#8217;t be using your legs to lift the weight.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Dips: </strong>If you notice your body swinging during dips, you need to strengthen your core. Focus on contracting and engaging your core to prevent swinging.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Pull-ups: </strong>Similar to dips, if you have a hard time performing pull-ups because your body is swaying, engage the core during the movement.</li>
</ul>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you wanna lose that belly fat and get ripped six pack abs, you don&#8217;t need to hire an expensive personal trainer or go to the gym. All you need to do is get a dumbbell and follow these workout routines!</p>
<h2>Weighted Ab Workout For A Ripped Six Pack Abs</h2>
<h3></h3>
<h3>Start With Your Gut</h3>
<p><!-- instagram error: invalid instagram resource --></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">When it comes to getting ripped six pack abs, there’s one thing you should not overlook. Diet. So before you try this workout, if you’re not sure <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/healthy-eating-mistakes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">what you should be eating</a> in order to really chisel your abs, take my free body type quiz to learn the 3 most important things to do to see results.</span></p>
<div>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://vshred.com/sp/survey/survey-aka1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="s1">Click Here To Take The Free Body Type Quiz!</span></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Once your <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/healthy-eating-mistakes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">dietary concerns</a> are out of the way, it’s time to train those abs! Abs are just like any other muscle group, but smaller than most. That means you need to train them and let them recover just like any other muscle. So we recommend doing this weighted ab workout no more than every other day making sure to allow your abdominal muscles to recover completely.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">All you will need for this workout is a single dumbbell. You may pick the weight of your choice or use no weight at all (this depends on your physical capability) and do as follows:</span></p>
<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1">The Workout</span></h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There are four total exercises and for each exercise, you will do 4 sets of 10-15 reps with only 20 seconds of rest in-between. If you cannot handle this layout, you may extend your rest period slightly or break the sets into “mini sets” but make sure to complete the same total number of reps.</span></p>
<h3><span class="s1">Dumbbell Straight-Arm Crunches</span></h3>
<p><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/3ksxlaN8sLsKFMri0P"><img src="https://i0.wp.com/media.giphy.com/media/3ksxlaN8sLsKFMri0P/giphy.gif?resize=480%2C270&#038;ssl=1" alt="Animated GIF - Find &amp; Share on GIPHY" width="480" height="270" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In this abs routine, you’re going to lay flat on your back with your knees bent. Hold the dumbbell out straight above you and continue to push the dumbbell straight towards the ceiling as you crunch.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">4 sets of 10-15 reps. </span></p>
<h3><span class="s1">Dumbbell Reverse Crunches</span></h3>
<p><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/B1SY1kmjV1yVAJcbpJ"><img src="https://i2.wp.com/media.giphy.com/media/B1SY1kmjV1yVAJcbpJ/giphy.gif?resize=480%2C270&#038;ssl=1" alt="Animated GIF - Find &amp; Share on GIPHY" width="480" height="270" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Lay flat on your back again for this one but this time, place a dumbbell between your feet with your knees completely bent and thighs pointing straight up. Hold on to the dumbbell with your feet and bring your legs up toward your chest making sure your lower back gets off the ground. Focus on using your abs to pull your legs up and not getting momentum from your knees or feet. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">4 sets of 10-15 reps.</span></p>
<h3><span class="s1">Rotating Mountain Climbers</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For this one, get into a regular push-up position. Now, similar to mountain climbers, you will be driving your knees upward but will also do a twist as you do so. So you drive your knees to your opposite elbow as you twist your core.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">4 sets of 10-15 reps each way.</span></p>
<h3><span class="s1">Dumbbell Woodchops</span></h3>
<p><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/uANrWMqcPO9s62VFoZ"><img src="https://i0.wp.com/media.giphy.com/media/uANrWMqcPO9s62VFoZ/giphy.gif?resize=480%2C270&#038;ssl=1" alt="Animated GIF - Find &amp; Share on GIPHY" width="480" height="270" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Stand with a single dumbbell held by both hands and start off by turning your shoulders completely to one side, keeping the dumbbell low. Rotate your shoulders to the opposite side as you raise the dumbbell up high above your head in the process. Focus on engaging your core with the twists.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">4 sets of 10-15 each way.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">These core exercises, </span>as well as other <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/workout-plans-weight-loss/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">fat burning workouts</a>,<span style="font-size: 1rem;">will h</span>elp you get six pack abs and lead a healthier, more active life.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When I’m specifically trying to gain strength or size through my entire body, I rotate through this 5-day workout routine.</p>
<p>In this article:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="#chest">Day 1: Chest</a></li>
<li><a href="#back">Day 2: Back</a></li>
<li><a href="#legs">Day 3: Legs</a></li>
<li><a href="#arms">Day 4: Arms</a></li>
<li><a href="#shoulders">Day 5: Shoulders</a></li>
</ol>
<h2>5 Day Weekly Workout Routine</h2>
<p>When I prescribe workouts for my clients, I always make sure I’ve done each and every one of the exercises as well as the routine itself to make sure it works the muscles I want to be working, to make sure it’s set at the proper difficulty, and to make sure I’ve done a run through for when questions arise. I do change up my workout routines from time to time, but in general, my <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/weight-training-beginners/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">weight training</a> stays relatively consistent.</p>
<p>Based on the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) guidelines for resistance training, if you’re trying to gain strength or size, it’s ideal to hit each major muscle group at least twice a week. <strong>Major muscle groups include chest, core, arms, shoulders, back, and legs.</strong> Because of these guidelines, I have a couple of different routines I go through. Below is one of my primary weekly routines.</p>
<div id="chest">

<p>In addition to my weekly routine of weight training, all of my lifting is followed up by at least 20 minutes of <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/full-cardio-workout-done-in-only-4-minutes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cardio</a>. I’ll generally do <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/hiit-workout-plan-burn-calories-in-4-minutes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HIIT training</a> if it’s only 20-25 minutes of cardio. Anything that hits 30 minutes of cardio generally entails more steady-state cardio. I aim to get at least 2 miles on the treadmill during my cardio sessions.</p>

<h2>9 Easy Abs Workout Home Routines to Get Six-Pack Abs</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>1. Six-Pack Shred by V Shred</h3>

There are no shortcuts when it comes to fitness. The fastest way to sculpt a lean, tight stomach is to follow a scientifically proven abs workout home routine.</p>
<p>Fitness buffs who want to take their flat stomach workout to the next level can try Six-Pack Shred. It’s a complete abs-sculpting fitness plan that tells you exactly what to do and what not to do.</p>

<h3>2. Quick 5-Minute Abs Workout</h3>
<p><a href="https://gph.is/2RxgY8i"><img src="https://i0.wp.com/media.giphy.com/media/2sh5YOqpbB4jgPbHCB/giphy.gif?resize=480%2C270&#038;ssl=1" alt="Animated GIF - Find &amp; Share on GIPHY" width="480" height="270" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><br />
With this quick abs workout home routine, time will never be an issue. It consists of nine moves you have to do for five minutes without resting.</p>
<p>The goal of this exercise is to perform more reps as you do the routine more often. Don’t worry if you can’t bust out one rep per second yet. What’s important is to make small steps toward your bigger goal: washboard abs.</p>
<p>You can do this as a standalone exercise, or you can incorporate it at the end of your gym workout.</p>
<p><strong>How to:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Lying Leg Raises (30 seconds)</li>
<li>Windmills (30 seconds)</li>
<li>Starfish Crunch (30 seconds)</li>

<li>Russian Twists (30 seconds)</li>

<p>Do you have what it takes to do seven intense ab exercises twice nonstop for seven minutes? Then this intense ab workout is for you.</p>
<p>It’s a very simple routine you can do almost anywhere. Whether you’re at the comfort of your own home or at the gym, park, or even a hotel. All you need is yourself and seven minutes of your time.</p>
<p><strong>How to:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Heel Touches</li>
<li>Bicycle Crunches</li>
<li>Reach-Through Crunch</li>
<li>Jackknife Crunch</li>
<li>Starfish Crunch</li>
<li>Windmills</li>
<li>Heel Touches</li>
</ul>
<h3>4. M100 (3 Minutes)</h3>
<p><a href="https://gph.is/2Rwy7Po"><img src="https://i1.wp.com/media.giphy.com/media/8JTbHz12Rw8ysN3EXj/giphy.gif?resize=480%2C270&#038;ssl=1" alt="Animated GIF - Find &amp; Share on GIPHY" width="480" height="270" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><br />
No <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/workout-plans-weight-loss/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">fat-burning session</a> is complete without a few rounds of HIIT. The M100 is an intense HIIT workout that’ll have your abs, core, and legs screaming in pain.</p>
<p>The routine consists of three moves. The goal is to go through the circuit three times then cap it off with 10 extra reps of the first move.</p>
<p>The average gym-goer should complete this in around three minutes. As you do the workout routine more often, aim to finish it in a shorter amount of time.</p>
<p><strong>How to:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Burpees</li>
<li>Mountain Climbers</li>
<li>Jump Squats</li>

It consists of 10 moves you need to do for 50 seconds each with a 10-second rest in between.</p>
<p>To make the circuit more difficult, aim to bust out as many reps as you can per exercise. After going through the circuit, you can opt to stop there or do it all again from the top.</p>

<ul>

As the name suggests, this is a complete regimen to help fitness buffs sculpt abs of steel. You can make the circuit more challenging by increasing the number of sets.</p>
<p>For example, beginners can go through the circuit three times. Meanwhile, our advanced lifters can try performing the whole circuit seven times.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Are you looking for a great lower ab workout to fit into your busy schedule? Read on for a 4-minute workout that will work your lower abs and save you time from going to the gym!</p>
<h2>Quick and Easy Lower Ab Workout at Home</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>The Lower Abdominal Muscle</strong></h3>
<p>Your lower abdominal muscle plays an important role in supporting your spine and providing you with stability throughout your movements. It&#8217;s especially useful to workout this set of core muscles to help you with your everyday tasks and <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/strength-training/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">strengthen your core</a>.</p>
<p>The problem is, these abs can be hard to tone. However, a few minutes of solid lower ab exercises can help adjust your form and lessen back strain.</p>
<h3><strong>4 Exercises for Ripped Abs</strong></h3>
<p>The four exercises in this lower ab workout are perfect for contracting your lower abs and keeping them engaged at every movement. These are also perfect for a <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/best-ab-workout-plan-for-beginners-only-4-minutes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">beginners ab workout</a>, as well as for experienced gym-goers who are looking for a quick workout on their off days.</p>
<h3>1. Straight Leg Press Ups</h3>
<p><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/KXrL86mruIRCeXn0kr"><img src="https://i0.wp.com/media.giphy.com/media/KXrL86mruIRCeXn0kr/giphy.gif?resize=480%2C270&#038;ssl=1" alt="Animated GIF - Find &amp; Share on GIPHY" width="480" height="270" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>The limited range in motion of this exercise fully engages your lower core by really driving your hips and your legs upwards. The best thing about your legs pressing up is it keeps you from creating momentum, making your lower abs do all the work.</p>
<p><strong>How to do a straight leg press up:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Lay down on your back with your hands resting on the sides.</li>
<li>Raise your legs up toward the ceiling and you’ll start feeling your lower abs burn a bit.</li>
<li>Then thrust your hips upward as you lift your feet closer to the ceiling.</li>
<li>Bring it back down slowly and repeat.</li>
<li>Do this for 25 seconds then take a 5-second rest.</li>
</ul>
<h3>2. Lying Sprints</h3>
<p><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/28Mpy1LAQcAQ3zgeZ1"><img src="https://i1.wp.com/media.giphy.com/media/28Mpy1LAQcAQ3zgeZ1/giphy.gif?resize=480%2C270&#038;ssl=1" alt="Animated GIF - Find &amp; Share on GIPHY" width="480" height="270" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>Lying sprints are just like bicycle kicks, but you&#8217;re trying to get in as much movement as you can in a few seconds. This will constantly keep your abs engaged while it contracts after every switch.</p>
<p><strong>How to do a lying sprint:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Lie down on the ground with your hands resting at your sides.</li>
<li>Bring your left knee and right elbow together to meet in front of your chest.</li>
<li>Then switch to doing this with your right knee and left elbow.</li>
<li>Do this for 25 seconds then take a 5-second rest.</li>
</ul>
<h3>3. Reverse Crunches</h3>
<p><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/1SFs2tvLmr3NBNWmJq"><img src="https://i2.wp.com/media.giphy.com/media/1SFs2tvLmr3NBNWmJq/giphy.gif?resize=480%2C270&#038;ssl=1" alt="Animated GIF - Find &amp; Share on GIPHY" width="480" height="270" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>Reverse crunches are one of the most common ab exercises to strengthen your core. Apart from the benefits it brings to your lower back, it also stabilizes your spine and hips.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also a better alternative to the normal crunch because the movement of bringing your knees to your chest protects your back from injury. At the same time, it keeps your abdominal muscles fully engaged.</p>
<p><strong>How to do a reverse crunch:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Lay on your back with your palms down at your sides.</li>
<li>Bend your knees until they’re pointed towards the ceiling.</li>
<li>Place one foot on top of the other to keep your legs stabilized.</li>
<li>Then bring your knees all the way toward your head.</li>
<li>Pull it back but don’t let your feet touch the ground. Repeat.</li>
<li>Do this for 25 seconds then take a 5-second rest.</li>
</ul>
<h3>4. Plank In and Outs</h3>
<p><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/fQoIBkQcu0CEXamJGG"><img src="https://i1.wp.com/media.giphy.com/media/fQoIBkQcu0CEXamJGG/giphy.gif?resize=480%2C270&#038;ssl=1" alt="Animated GIF - Find &amp; Share on GIPHY" width="480" height="270" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>Plank in and outs are a slower and harder form of mountain climbers. As you slowly bring your toes in, you&#8217;re constantly contracting your lower abs.</p>
<p><strong>How to do plank in and outs:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Start in a plank position.</li>
<li>Slowly crawl in with your toes going towards your elbows. About 3 to 4 steps will do.</li>
<li>Make sure you’re driving your belly button in towards the ceiling.</li>
<li>Then slowly crawl back until you’re in a static plank.</li>
<li>Do this for 25 seconds then take a 5-second rest.</li>
</ul>

]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Your ab workout routine may include the worst ab exercise ever, and you might not even know it. The best ab exercises engage your muscles to strengthen them throughout each movement, but what if these core exercises are static?</p>
<p>Find out what’s the worst ab exercise you can do and how to make it more effective here.</p>
<h2>The Worst Ab Exercise and It&#8217;s Not What You Think</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>The Plank</strong></h3>
<p>You should stop doing the static plank exercise because it’s not an optimal exercise for <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/best-ab-workout-plan-for-beginners-only-4-minutes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">improving your core strength</a>. It may only be effective for a minute but after that, your body is tired and you&#8217;d often shift to an incorrect form.</p>
<p>This will take away the focus on your abs and shift towards <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/full-shoulder-workout-video/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">your shoulders</a>, legs, and lower back instead. Ditch the static plank right now and try these other planking exercises below.</p>
<h3><strong>Alternative Plank Exercises</strong></h3>
<p>Implementing shorter movements with plank exercises will contract the abs to strengthen them. These three alternative plank exercises add movement to a static plank to keep your abs engaged.</p>
<h3>1. Hard Planks</h3>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6643" src="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Hard-Planks-giphy.gif?resize=480%2C270&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="480" height="270" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>Hard planks will <a href="https://vshred.com/sp/six-pack-shred/v1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">keep your ab muscles engaged</a> throughout each short movement. This will help keep the focus on your core muscles.</p>
<p><strong>How to do a hard plank:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Lie down on your stomach with your elbows propped up on the floor.</li>
<li>Flex your abs.</li>
<li>Then lift your body upwards until it forms a hollow curve.</li>
<li>Bring it back down to the floor.</li>
<li>Repeat this for a timed period or 4 sets of 15 reps.</li>
</ul>
<h3>2. Advanced Plank</h3>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6644" src="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Advanced-Planks-giphy.gif?resize=480%2C270&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="480" height="270" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>An advanced plank requires you to drive your <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/low-back-pain-exercise/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">lower back</a> upwards as high as you can. This short movement will give you a deep contraction in your abs.</p>
<p><strong>How to do an advanced plank:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Start in a static plank position.</li>
<li>Then roll your lower back upwards (higher than what you&#8217;d do in the hard plank) while flexing your abs.</li>
<li>Return to the starting position.</li>
<li>Repeat this movement for a specific time period or 4 sets of 15 reps.</li>
</ul>
<h3>3. Twisting Side Planks</h3>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6646" src="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Twisting-Side-Planks-giphy.gif?resize=480%2C270&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="480" height="270" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>A lot of people do side planks to strengthen the sidewalls of their abs, but adding these short movements to the side plank will continually contract the muscles and build more strength.</p>
<p><strong>How to do a twisting side plank:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Start in a side plank position, with your right elbow propped up on the floor under your right shoulder.</li>
<li>Then twist your left shoulder inwards towards your chest while rotating your body along with it. Do this until your body faces the floor.</li>
<li>Bring down your left arm on the floor.</li>
<li>Twist your left shoulder back up until you’re in a side plank position again.</li>
<li>Repeat this for 4 sets of 15 reps, and then switch to the other side.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Watch this video from our YouTube channel V Shred to find out more about why this is the worst ab exercise:</strong></p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='1170' height='659' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/hJMZDxjAcNA?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></p>
<p>The worst ab exercise tests your endurance without strengthening the abs. Abs work to stabilize your spine. Your core muscles help with lifting movements and short movements like squats, pull-ups, and bench press exercises.</p>
<p>This set of muscles also plays a role in enhancing your reflexes. This is why you need to do the right planking exercises that will strengthen your core muscles.</p>
