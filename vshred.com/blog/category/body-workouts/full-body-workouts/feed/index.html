								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3 style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>Thank You V Shred Family: Celebrating 2-Million YouTube Subscribers With A Special Discount &amp; Brand New Workout!</strong></em></h3>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-7394" src="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/ezgif-5-dffd30744146.gif?resize=600%2C600&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="600" height="600" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>We are kind of at a loss for words.</p>
<p>If you had told us in 2015 when we first started our journey to change millions of lives through a health and fitness channel on YouTube  that we would reach<strong> 2-MILLION SUBSCRIBERS</strong> with over 450 million total views and counting in just 5 short years we probably wouldn’t have believed you.</p>
<p>We knew we had lofty goals and knew we would reach them one day, but honestly we thought the milestone we just reached was going to take much longer.</p>
<p>Yet, because of you here we are.</p>
<p>In only 5 years, we have created one of the world’s most popular fitness YouTube Channels and just recently hit <strong>2-Million Subscribers!</strong></p>
<p><!-- instagram error: invalid instagram resource --></p>
<p>It all started on March 2015… Four guys with a vision to simplify training and put the fun back in fitness.</p>
<p>Four guys that just wanted to show people that they can transform their body without endless hours in the gym and rabbit food diets.</p>
<p>Four guys that wanted to help people better their health and build self-confidence.</p>
<p>Now four people wanting to change lives has grown to a family of 2-MILLION from all over the world, and that is on YouTube alone.</p>
<p>We also have millions of social media followers, hundreds-of-thousands of custom training clients in 120+ countries, and have seen more people than we can count transform their bodies using our free YouTube workouts, free body-type quiz, and digital fitness programs.</p>

<p>Second .. I know our YouTube subscribers have been waiting on some new workout videos to hit the channel.</p>
<p>We have been working hard behind the scenes putting all that together and have a ton of content we are anxious to post.</p>

<p>The heavier the DBs you use, or the greater the resistance of the bands, the harder the workout will be!</p>
<p>Or you can skip out on any equipment and only use your body weight!</p>
<p>Set a timer for 10 Minutes and repeat this 10 move circuit as many times as possible without resting! <strong>Let’s Go!</strong></p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='1170' height='659' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/BtO8xt9z6PE?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>10 Min AT HOME Full Body Workout</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Goblet Squat w/shoulder press &#8211; 10 reps</li>
<li>Reverse Lunges w/bicep curl &#8211; 10 reps each side</li>
<li>Lateral Squats w/tricep kickback &#8211; 10 reps each side &#8211; 1 tricep kickback between sides</li>
<li>3-way-raise (lateral-to front-to upright) &#8211; 10 reps (one rep is all three)</li>
<li>Push-Ups &#8211; to shoulder taps &#8211; 10 reps (one rep is after push up, and shoulder tap each arm)</li>

<li>Plank &#8211; 30 seconds</li>
</ul>
<p>You will keep repeating this with NO REST until your TEN MINUTE TIMER IS UP! This 10 min workout will burn even more calories if you use dumbbells or resistance bands. You don’t always need fancy gym equipment or a large wide open space to get in a killer sweat session!</p>
<p>This workout is only 10 minutes so make sure you PUSH YOURSELF!! You can make an excuse, or you can MAKE time!</p>
<p>ONE MORE IMPORTANT THING….<br />
While this workout is great to throw in when you are “in a pinch” and will no doubt make anyone work up a sweat and blast some major calories, when it comes to achieving optimal results, you need a long term plan that you can adhere to more days than not.</p>
<p>It needs to factor in your personal starting point, your end goal, and, most importantly, your body type.</p>
<p>We have a <a href="https://vshred.com/sp/survey/survey-aka1/">FREE BODY TYPE QUIZ</a> that you can take that will take all the guesswork out and show you exactly how you should train and eat to fuel YOUR body!</p>
<p>We know if you are reading this you are probably already strapped for time.<br />
Don’t worry! <a href="https://vshred.com/sp/survey/survey-aka1/">The FREE BODY TYPE QUIZ</a> is only FIVE QUESTIONS.</p>
<p>Once you complete it, you will finally have the mystery taken out of how you should train and eat! So think of this quiz as only a few moments of your day that will give you back hours of time and stress later down the road!</p>
<p>DON’T FORGET ABOUT OUR SPECIAL THANK YOU &#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>We are giving you 30% off your Sculpt Nation order with codE: 2MILL30</strong><br />
<strong>So go stock up on all your favorites before the code expires! <a href="https://sculptnation.com/products">CLICK HERE TO SHOP!</a></strong></p>

<p>It is that time of year!! 4th of July is upon us!!</p>
<p>Burgers on the grill … fireworks in the sky … and for many .. an excuse to skip the gym and eat thousands of calories .. in one sitting!</p>
<p>It can be tempting to throw your diet and training mindset out the window when holidays come around. But you must treat holidays just like you would any other day.</p>
<p>Have fun .. enjoy the time with family … and even enjoy all the food .. but keep your goals in mind. One of the best things you can do .. is still get in a solid workout!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>We’ve got the perfect 4th of July PRE PARTY PUMP!</strong></em></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-7322" src="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_8006.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_8006.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_8006.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_8006.jpeg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_8006.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>The workout we&#8217;re giving you below will not only burn a ton of calories .. the endorphins released from this short HIIT workout will boost your mood .. which will help you keep your healthy food habits in mind when it’s time to fire up the grill!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>We will never tell you that you need to “earn” your calories .. that is not the kind of relationship with food we promote here at V Shred &amp; Sculpt Nation.</strong></em></p>
<p>Food should never be seen as “the enemy” or “a reward” .. and exercise should never be viewed as punishment.</p>
<p>Diet culture makes us feel bad about having a nice dinner with friends, and it makes us fall into the mind trap that holidays will make us gain weight.</p>
<p><em><strong>What happens next?</strong></em></p>
<p><img class="size-large wp-image-7158" src="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_215638387.jpeg?resize=1024%2C684&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="684" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_215638387.jpeg?resize=1024%2C684&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_215638387.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_215638387.jpeg?resize=768%2C513&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_215638387.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_215638387.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>We feel guilt .. and view exercise as “punishment” we “have” to get up and do the next day .. or as justification that if we burn a ton of calories pre-feast .. it’s okay to eat that extra serving of ice cream or calorie-filled cocktail.</p>
<p>Once you get this mentality, you will begin an endless (and very unhealthy) relationship with food. You will start to believe you ALWAYS have to earn food .. and will only feel okay about enjoying yourself .. if you have exercised.</p>
<p>Instead, look at your patriotic pump as a FREEDOM that you are blessed to have! You have an able body that GETS to move!!!</p>
<p>And view all that 4th of July food as FUEL! Getting in a workout before a big meal is a great way to rev up your metabolism and prepare your body to USE (instead of store) any extra calories you may consume!</p>
<p>Don’t fall into this food guilt trap<em>..</em>But also don’t go to the totally opposite end of the spectrum and make the holidays an excuse to be lazy and throw all your food mindfulness out the window! Use the short 15-minute workout  below and then ENJOY your day!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>Alright .. let’s get our PATRIOTIC PUMP ON!!</strong></em></p>
<p>Here is a quick fat blasting FOLLOW-ALONG cardio workout that won’t interfere with your day full of fun with friends and family!</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='1170' height='659' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/HzkBonK4kPQ?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The video above is a FOLLOW ALONG! Just press play and get to work! This fat-blasting workout consists of only 5 exercises. You will do each exercise for 40 seconds and take a quick 20-second break before moving on to the next exercise.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Explosive Squat with Calf Raises &#8211; 40 Seconds</strong><br />
<strong>Speed Skaters &#8211; 40 Seconds</strong><br />
<strong>High Knees &#8211; 40 Seconds</strong><br />
<strong>Alternating Toe Taps &#8211; 40 Seconds</strong><br />
<strong>Bicycles &#8211; 40 Seconds</strong></p>

<p><img class="size-full wp-image-7152" src="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_334018142.jpeg?resize=1170%2C780&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1170" height="780" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_334018142.jpeg?w=6720&amp;ssl=1 6720w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_334018142.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_334018142.jpeg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_334018142.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_334018142.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_334018142.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1170px) 100vw, 1170px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>It is officially (unofficial) .. <em><strong>summer is here!!</strong></em></p>
<p>Memorial Day marks the unofficial start of summer, and I don’t know about you, but I’m excited to take some of my workouts outside!</p>
<p>Today we’ve got a full-body workout that you can do from your backyard or wherever your Memorial Day weekend takes you!</p>
<p>It doesn’t require any equipment. We are using bodyweight only, and it can be adjusted to any fitness level!</p>
<p>Of course, you can do this working indoors if you choose, but as long as you are hydrated, try breaking a sweat outside!</p>
<p>Taking your workouts outdoors has a ton of benefits .. here are a few!</p>
<p><strong>3 BENEFITS OF EXERCISING OUTSIDE</strong></p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-7153" src="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_222896530.jpeg?resize=1170%2C780&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1170" height="780" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_222896530.jpeg?w=5040&amp;ssl=1 5040w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_222896530.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_222896530.jpeg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_222896530.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_222896530.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_222896530.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1170px) 100vw, 1170px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><strong>1: You May Burn More Calories</strong><br />
Some small studies found outdoor exercisers burn a few more calories than those who exercise indoors. The theory is that exercising outdoors exerts more energy.</p>
<p>Be careful.. this could have the opposite effect if you are attempting to workout when temperatures are extreme.</p>
<p>Working out when it’s too hot could affect your endurance. You may also be more tempted to shorten the duration of your workout.</p>
<p>Try doing your outdoor workouts early in the morning before temperatures spike, or later in the evening.</p>
<p>Always stay extra hydrated and above all.. listen to your body!</p>
<p><strong>2: It Could Cheer You Up</strong><br />
Hundreds of studies have shown that soaking up the sun and being surrounded by mother nature helps alleviate stress and improve overall mood!</p>
<p>Exercising outdoors has even been shown to enhance your brain! Researchers say this is because being outside stimulates all five senses at once &#8211; something that can’t be achieved inside a gym or your living room.</p>
<p>Head outside .. breathe in some fresh air .. take a moment to appreciate the beauty around you! Maybe even take off your headphones and listen to the sounds of nature!</p>
<p>A little natural Vitamin D is no doubt a great motivator to get moving!</p>
<p><strong>3: It Saves You Money</strong><br />
Gym memberships are not cheap. Not to mention, they often go unused.</p>
<p>How many times have you paid for a year and only showed up once or twice a week, or even worse, gone months without entering a building that you pay to use?</p>
<p>If you can go every day, a gym membership is no doubt worth the money. But despite what most believe, it’s not required to get in a solid training session.</p>
<p>That is why we focus on so many home workouts on our <strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/vshred" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">YouTube Channel</a></strong>, and why we recently created an entire program called <a href="https://vshred.com/sp/move/soc-all" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MOVE</a> that can be done from home. You can check that out <a href="https://vshred.com/sp/move/soc-all" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>HERE</strong></a> if you are interested!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>ALRIGHT… let’s break a sweat!</strong></em></p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-7154" src="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_212104629.jpeg?resize=1170%2C780&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1170" height="780" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_212104629.jpeg?w=5760&amp;ssl=1 5760w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_212104629.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_212104629.jpeg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_212104629.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_212104629.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_212104629.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1170px) 100vw, 1170px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Congrats! You have the perfect human dumbbell! They may cry, kick, and scream at times .. but on the bright side, that just provides a little more resistance, right?</p>
<p>Another perk of using your infant for resistance is that you will naturally use progressive overload because infants grow….fast! This means that almost weekly your “weight” will become heavier and more of a challenge!</p>
<p>When it comes to a newborn/infant, you will need to be selective with exercise choice and modify how you hold your baby if they are unable to hold their head up on their own. And for all you new mamas .. you always want to have approval from your doctor before resuming physical activity post-pregnancy!</p>
<p><em><strong>Using your baby instead of a traditional weight is an easy modification to make!</strong></em><br />
Take a look at any weight lifting workout you currently do or find one of our home workouts on the V Shred <a href="https://www.youtube.com/vshred" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">YouTube Channel</a> that uses simple weights like dumbbells.</p>
<p>Instead of holding the weight .. carefully hold your baby! Or if you have a body baby carrier, strap them in and get to work!</p>
<p><em><strong>Here is an idea!</strong></em><br />
Do an EMOM workout! This training style isn’t technically named after you mamas, but EMOM workouts are a great way to get in a good workout if you have limited time (which we know is an issue for many moms.)</p>
<p>EMOM stands for every minute on the minute. You perform a different exercise every minute. You begin the prescribed number of reps at the top of the minute and then get to rest for whatever time is left until the next top of the minute!</p>
<ul>
<li>Pick any movements from the list below or use your own.</li>
<li>Set a timer for the length you choose. We like using a duration of 10 minutes. That means you will be doing 10 different</li>
<li>exercises, in only 10 minutes!</li>
<li>When all exercises are complete, rest &amp; repeat as many times as you want!</li>
<li>You can use the same movements for your next round(s) &#8211; or pick different ones.</li>
<li>We like doing 30 total minutes, if possible. The first round upper body, second round lower body, and the third round abs &amp; cardio.</li>
</ul>
<p>Remember, your goal is to get in the prescribed number of reps in less than a minute.<br />
The faster you finish .. the more rest time you get! You may need to adjust reps based on your fitness level.</p>

<p><strong>Baby Squat Shoulder Press (15 reps)</strong><br />
Stand with feet slightly wider than shoulder-width apart and your toes pointed slightly out. Hold your baby with hands positioned under armpits. While holding the baby, perform your squat, and as you come up, lift the baby into the air above your head into a shoulder press.</p>
<p><strong>Baby Squat Front Delt Raise (15 reps)</strong><br />
Perform these the same way as the baby squat above, except raise your baby up into a front raise (to about chest height) as you lower into your squat.</p>
<p><strong>Baby Squat Press (15 reps)</strong><br />
Perform these the same way as the baby squat above, except hold your baby close to your chest and push out into a chest press as you squat down.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>**Change your with foot position if you are incorporating more than one squat press into your EMOM workout! Go super wide into a sumo stance more glute/hamstring focused squats, or super wide with toes pointed further out in a plie position to work inner thighs**</em></p>
<p><strong>Forward Lunge With Baby Twist (5 reps each leg, for 10 total twisting lunges)</strong><br />
Hold your baby in whatever position you find most comfortable. Lunge forward with your right leg. Before you bring your left foot forward, twist/rotate your upper body to the right while leaving your lower body stationary in the lunge position. Rotate back to center and bring your back foot forward to complete the lunge. Do the same thing on the opposite side, always twisting in the direction of your front foot. Continue walking forward until you have completed 10 total steps.</p>
<p><strong>Loving Walking Lunges (10 each leg for 20 total steps)</strong><br />
Do these in the same way you perform the walking lunge with a twist; however, you do not do the twist; you simply keep walking and lunging!</p>
<p><strong>Baby Weight Glute Bridge (15 slow and controlled reps)</strong><br />
Lie on your back with your knees bent and your feet hip-distance apart. Place your baby on your lap. Raise your hips into a glute bridge (try to keep most of the weight in your heels) and squeeze big at the top before slowly lowering back to the floor.</p>
<p><strong>Baby Ab Crunch (15 crunches)</strong><br />
Lie face-up on the floor with your knees bent in the air at a 90-degree angle.<br />
Stabilize your baby, so it is resting on your shins, and hold onto his/her hands.<br />
To perform the crunch, slowly extend your legs away from you as you lift your shoulder blades off the ground. Slowly curl your upper body forward into a crunch, and at the same time, bring your knees in toward your chest. Stretch your legs out while leaning back &#8211; as far as you can reach. Repeat.</p>
<p><strong>Baby Chest Press (15 presses)</strong><br />
Lie on your back with your knees bent and your feet hip-distance apart. Place your baby on your chest and press them toward the ceiling. Squeeze your pecs together before lowering them back to the starting position.</p>
<p><img class="size-large wp-image-7114" src="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_228555310-1.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_228555310-1.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_228555310-1.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_228555310-1.jpeg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_228555310-1.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><strong>Standard Push-Up Kisses (15 pushups)</strong><br />
On a mat, lay your baby underneath you. Start in a high plank position with your wrists under your elbows and your abs engaged. Lower down until your elbows are bent to 90 degrees, and give your baby a kiss! Come to your knees to make the push-up easier.</p>
<p><strong>Tricep Push-Up Kisses (15 pushups)</strong><br />
Perform these push-ups the same way you do the standard push up above, except you will keep your arms parallel to your sides and your elbows pointing back. Come to your knees to make the push-up easier.</p>
<p><strong>Burpee Kisses (10 burpees)</strong><br />
Perform in the same way you did the push-ups. You may need to scoot your baby slightly forward since you will need enough room to jump or step your feet forward to perform your burpee. You can skip the pushup portion if you want to make these less advanced.</p>
<p><strong>Baby Lat Pullover (15 pullovers)</strong><br />
Lie on your back with your knees bent and your feet flat. Sit your baby on your chest, holding them under their arms. Lift them straight up, keeping your arms mostly straight, with only a slight bend in your elbows to prevent locking, throughout the entire movement. Extend your arms backward over your head as far back as you can. Return to the starting position by slowly pulling and squeezing with your lats and chest. Watch for those kicking little feet &#8211; otherwise, you might end up with a foot to the face 🙂</p>
<p><strong>Baby Bicep Hammer Curls (15 curls)</strong><br />
Hold your baby in front of you. Keeping elbows glued to your sides, and raise him or her to your chest in a curl. Don’t let your elbows swing outward and squeeze your biceps hard at the top of the movement. Return to start to complete one rep.</p>
<p><strong>Tummy Time Human Supermoms (10 supermans, with a hold at top)</strong><br />
On a mat, lay your baby on its tummy. Lay on your stomach face to face with your baby.<br />
Keep your neck in a neutral position and extend your arms and legs out straight out and wide.<br />
Keep your arms and legs straight and tummy glued to the mat as you simultaneously lift your arms and legs up toward the ceiling. Squeeze your lower back and glutes and hold for two to five seconds before you lower back down to the starting position.</p>
<p><strong>Tummy Time Human Lat Pulldowns (15 pullbacks with a big squeeze)</strong><br />
In the same position as the supermoms, do the exact same movement. Instead of holding at the top of the movement, pull your elbows down to your sides and squeeze. Reverse the movement. That is one rep. You can use a loop band or even a rolled up towel to make these even more difficult!</p>

<p><strong>Baby Reverse Ab Crunches (15 crunches)</strong><br />
Lie face up on the floor, and bring your knees toward your chest. Place your baby on your shins. Contract your abs to gently tilt your hips up off the floor as you lift your head and shoulders at the same time. Lower and repeat.</p>
<p><strong>Pop Jump Peek-A-Boo (15 jumps)</strong><br />
Lay your baby on a mat in front of you. Start with your feet together and then jump your legs out as far as you can into a low squat. Immediately jump back to your starting position. Play a game of peek-a-boo with your hands as you “pop” for each rep! Go fast! This is a cardio plyometric move to get your heart rate up!</p>
<p><strong>Tickle Squat Jumps (15 jumps)</strong><br />
This is another plyometric cardio movement. Lay your baby on a mat in front of you. Perform squat jumps, and at the bottom of every jump, give your baby a little toe tickle! Get creative! You can do this for any jumping “plyo” type movement (jumping lunges, starfish jumps, skaters, etc.)</p>
<p><strong>Baby Swings (15 swings)</strong><br />
Hold your baby under its arms facing you. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart.<br />
With a slight bend in your knees, your back flat and neck straight, hinge your hips back as you swing your baby between the inside the quads and then forcefully drive your hips forward as you swing your baby in front of you, traveling no higher than your shoulders. Control the descent as you immediately go into the next rep.</p>
<p><strong>Baby Russian Twists (10 each side for 20 total twists)</strong><br />
While sitting, hold your baby under its bottom and upper back, or under its arms. Lean back onto your tailbone with legs bent. Engage your core and twist from left to right while holding your baby. Try not to let your feet touch the floor!</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-7101" src="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_205815699.jpeg?resize=1170%2C781&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1170" height="781" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_205815699.jpeg?w=7360&amp;ssl=1 7360w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_205815699.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_205815699.jpeg?resize=768%2C513&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_205815699.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_205815699.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_205815699.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1170px) 100vw, 1170px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Tummy Time Planks (30 seconds without dropping)</strong><br />
On a mat, lay your baby underneath you and come to a forearm plank position. Keep your core tight, quads engaged and back flat &#8211; don’t let your hips sag or rise up. Hold your plank for 30 seconds (or longer if you want) and have a little chit-chat with your infant, or sing a song to help pass the time!</p>
<p><strong>Baby Ab Bicycles (15 cycles. One rep is once you have done each leg)</strong><br />
While sitting, hold your baby under its bottom and upper back, or under its arms. Lean back onto your tailbone with legs bent. Engage your core and cycle those legs while holding your baby straight up in the air.</p>
<p><strong>Tummy Time Plank Ups (10 plank ups. One rep is after you have done each side.)</strong><br />
On a mat, lay your baby underneath you and come to a high plank (push-up) position.<br />
Make sure your hands are directly under your shoulders.<br />
Keep your core tight, quads engaged and back flat &#8211; don’t let your hips sag or rise up.<br />
Lower down to your elbows one at a time. Then one at a time come back up to that high plank position. That is one rep.</p>
<p><strong>Tummy Time Plank Jacks (15 jacks)</strong><br />
On a mat, lay your baby underneath you and come to a high plank position.<br />
Jump your legs wide and then back together, just like a jumping jack motion. If this is too difficult, you can alternate legs, taping each foot out to the side. You can also try performing this in a low plank. Do whatever feels best for you!</p>
<p><strong>Tummy Time Mountain Climbers (15 reps. One rep is after you have done each side)</strong><br />
On a mat, lay your baby underneath you and come to a high plank (push-up) position.<br />
Make sure your hands are directly under your shoulders and weight on just your toes. Engage your core and start “running” &#8211; bringing your knees forward to your chest one at a time.</p>
<p><strong>Baby Tricep Press (15 reps)</strong><br />
Lay flat on your mat. Holding your baby around their waist, put the baby&#8217;s face over your face with your elbows pinned in close to your side. Only flexing your elbows, press your baby toward your thighs, lengthening arms as far as you can comfortably while squeezing your triceps. Reverse the movement back to the starting position.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Toddler Workout Ideas</strong><br />
You will still be able to use a growing toddler for resistance &#8211; your weight will obviously just be a bit heavier.</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-7102" src="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_300141388.jpeg?resize=1170%2C780&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1170" height="780" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_300141388.jpeg?w=5612&amp;ssl=1 5612w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_300141388.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_300141388.jpeg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_300141388.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_300141388.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_300141388.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1170px) 100vw, 1170px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>You can do any of the exercises above; however, you may want to adjust the rep range to be a tad lower since your “weight” will be more substantial.</p>
<p>Once your child is crawling and walking .. getting in a lift WITH them may become more challenging. Their attention span is shorter, so you will want to keep that in mind when selecting your mommy-and-me workout style.</p>
<p>EMOM or timer-based workouts can still work, but since there aren’t any real “breaks” with this style of training, it may be best to stick to standard set and rep style training… in case you need to chase them down between exercises!</p>
<p>As your toddler gets older, you can even make your timer-based sweat sessions a game, where they help you watch the timer or countdown with/for you!</p>
<p><strong>Toddler Backpack Lift</strong><br />
Just as you can with an infant, for any of the EMOM movements above, you can also strap your toddler into a forward or rear-facing backpack carrier and get to work!</p>
<p>If you don’t have that type of carrier for movements like squats, lunges, planks, and pushups, you can ask your toddler to crawl on your back and hold on tight!</p>
<p>Some of the above movements may even be more suitable with a toddler compared to an infant since they can hold their head up on their own.</p>
<p>Here are a few other exercises you can add to the list above that work well with a toddler.</p>
<ul>
<li>Bear Crawls (have them climb on your back or follow along)</li>
<li>Crab Walks (have them mimic you)</li>
<li>Lateral Side Shuffles (have them shadow you and make it a race)</li>
<li>High Knees (an easy one to have them mimic)</li>
<li>Jumping Jacks (another one your kids will love to try)</li>
<li>Box Jumps (give them a small step or just ask them to jump up and down)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Have A Dance Party</strong><br />
Dancing is a fun way to burn a ton of calories! You may have to compromise and turn on Baby Shark instead of Beyonce, but make a playlist full of songs that will keep your kiddos attention for however long you want to break a sweat and JUST DANCE! You don’t have to have any dancing skills. Do anything that keeps you moving and gets your heart rate up!</p>

<p><strong>Stroller Workout</strong><br />
Buy a jogging stroller and get moving! You can keep things simple and just go for a brisk walk or jog. To make things more challenging, you can find hills and push your stroller up them to simulate a treadmill incline walk or hill-sprints. You can also stop every couple of minutes and do some “strolling” lunges, plyometric jumps, strength moves like push-ups, etc.</p>
<p>If you are short on time or just want to make the most out of your walk around the block, try incorporating HIIT intervals into your stroller time.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>Here is an example of a short lower body focused HIIT cardio stroller workout!</strong></em><br />
Start with a brisk 5-minute stroller walk warm-up. Then do every exercise for 45 seconds and rest for 15 seconds before moving on to the next exercise. Once you are finished with the entire circuit, stop for some kisses for about a minute and repeat the circuit one more time!</p>
<ul>
<li>Stroller Push Walking Lunges</li>
<li>Lock &amp; Squat Jump (Stop where you are, lock your stroller and do jump squats)</li>
<li>Stroller Push Run/Sprint</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Water Workout</strong><br />
You obviously won’t be able to swim laps unless you have someone else in the pool supervising with you, but if you have a toddler that loves water, there are numerous exercises you can do with your kiddo that will help you get in a killer workout!</p>
<p>Doing a workout in water adds resistance on it’s own, but you can also add wrist or ankle weights to make your water workout even more challenging!</p>
<p>Hold your toddler for some of these movements, for others, put them in an appropriate floating device and have them next to you while you perform these aquatic style exercises!</p>
<ul>
<li>Water Walk (Hold your baby above your head as you walk for a challenge)</li>
<li>Jumping Jacks</li>
<li>High Knees</li>
<li>Pool Wall Push-Ups</li>
<li>Fast Leg Kick/Flutters</li>

<p style="text-align: center;">Once your kids get a little bit older, they will naturally be curious about your workouts.<br />
Use their “monkey-see-monkey-do” stage of life to your advantage!</p>
<p>Pending their age and personality, you can do any of the baby or toddler workouts above.<br />
If they are too heavy, instead of using your kids for weight, use dumbbells or bands and have them exercise with you! You can purchase “kid weights” online, or give them a light canned good, bag of rice, etc.</p>
<p>For things like the sit-ups, and glute-ham raise, you can even ask them to “help mommy” by sitting on your feet!</p>
<p>Just like toddlers, attention spans may be short, so you may want to try Tabata or HIIT style workouts. Anything that gets the job done .. fast!</p>
<p>Other exercises you can do with your 5+ kids:</p>
<ul>
<li>Jump Rope</li>
<li>Mini trampoline/trampoline jumping.</li>
<li>Racing down the length of your yard.</li>
<li>Any “sport” that requires activity &#8211; a game of football, basketball, baseball, or how about some dodgeball!</li>
<li>Yoga</li>
</ul>
<p>When you are finished, have them join you in the kitchen for a kid-friendly <a href="https://sculptnation.com/products/protein" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sculpt Nation Protein</a> smoothie!</p>
<p>You must give your body a fast-acting and easily digestible protein after a workout. You want to avoid going into a catabolic (muscle breakdown) state. If you let your muscles starve after training, that is exactly what you risk!</p>
<p>The quicker you rush quality, highly bioavailable <a href="https://sculptnation.com/products/protein" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PROTEIN</a> into your system post-workout, the faster you’ll increase your lean muscle, burn body fat, improve performance, and build strength.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Dog Mom Workout</strong><br />
Some moms only have kids with four legs and fur. Having a dog is a great way to ensure you get in those daily steps! Take them on several long walks, or if they aren’t too lazy of a breed, get them to jog with you! Just be careful if you live somewhere that it gets hot&#8230; the pavement could burn their little paws!</p>
<p>Pending the size (and personality) of your dog, you can do any of the exercises in our EMOM workout example and use your furry friends for a little resistance!</p>
<p>The biggest challenge you may face (other than an attention span that is likely even shorter than a human toddler) &#8211; is anything on the floor, like yoga!</p>
<p>When you are on “their level” … they will probably confuse YOUR mat time .. to be THEIR play time!</p>
<p>In case you need a smile or want to see some of the exercises above in action .. check out this video of one of our V Shred employees attempting to get in a workout with her 10-pound “fur child” Stella!</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>WHAT IS YOUR DEFINITION OF A MOM?</strong></p>
<p>If you ask Webster, the definition of MOM is: A female parent.</p>
<p>If you ask us, we think the definition of MOM is: One person who does the work of 50. Someone that sacrifices everything without asking for anything in return. The one who you can always count on above everyone else. A cheerleader, counselor, role model, a shoulder to cry on. The one that loves and accepts you no matter what.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Finding time to get in a workout can be an issue sometimes. On days you are scrambling to get in your regular training session, or if you just want to burn some EXTRA calories but don’t have an extra hour to devote to the gym … We’ve got a workout for you and you can not make any excuses to NOT do this workout! WHY? It is … <strong>Only Six Exercises &#8211; Just 12 Minutes Long &#8211; Requires No Equipment.</strong></p>
<p>We will be doing rounds of 30-seconds of ALL OUT WORK followed by 30-seconds of TOTAL REST for 12-minutes.</p>
<p>What makes this <strong>FAT BURNING WORKOUT</strong> different from some of the others we have sent out is that we are adding even more variety by changing exercises at the 15-second mark of each 30-second high interval! So you will be doing TWO FAT BLASTING MOVEMENTS for 15 seconds each before you take a little breather and move on!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Give this one a try … Watch the video below to follow along with the exercises, we guarantee you will be a sweaty mess!</strong></p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='1170' height='659' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/ctlLJgxArZM?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></p>
<h3>WORKOUT BREAKDOWN:</h3>
<p>15 seconds &#8211; HIGH KNEES<br />
15 seconds &#8211; JUMP LUNGS<br />
30 SECONDS REST<br />
<strong>REPEAT BOTH EXERCISES AND THE REST BEFORE MOVING ONTO THE NEXT TWO SETS.</strong></p>
<p>15 seconds &#8211; MOUNTAIN CLIMBERS<br />
15 seconds &#8211; CRAB TOE TOUCHES<br />
30 SECONDS REST<br />
<strong>REPEAT BOTH EXERCISES AND THE REST BEFORE MOVING ONTO THE NEXT SET.</strong></p>
<p>15 seconds &#8211; PUSH-UP SIDE PLANKS<br />
15 seconds &#8211; PLANK HIP ROLLS<br />
30 SECONDS REST<br />
<strong>REPEAT BOTH EXERCISES AND THE REST FOR 30 SECONDS BEFORE REPEATING ENTIRE WORKOUT ONCE MORE.</strong></p>
<p>You can also do ACTIVE REST during those rest periods if you want an extra challenge.</p>
<p><strong>12 MINUTES .. YOU ARE DONE!</strong></p>
<p>If you are wanting to blast a little extra fat, but don’t have an hour to pound away on a treadmill, give this workout a try a few times a week! Because it fits into such a short amount of time, it is a great option if you want to get in some extra calorie burn each week!</p>
<p><strong>This type of functional HIIT training is excellent for MANY reasons including:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>BLASTS FAT</li>
<li>PRESERVES MUSCLE</li>
<li>BURNS MORE CALORIES (both while you workout and HOURS after thanks to the after-burn effect)</li>
<li>TIME EFFICIENT</li>
<li>NOT BORING</li>
<li>YOU CAN DO IT ANYWHERE</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Let’s not forget</strong> …. once you are done with a HIIT workout it really does make you feel like you have put in some serious work!</p>
<p><strong>Imagine how fast you’d shred fat and enjoy your dream body if you combine HIIT with three powerful thermogenic agents that melt fat cells around the clock… <em>even while you sleep?</em><em>!</em> <a href="https://sculptnation.com/fat-loss-stack/">The Fat Loss Stack</a></strong> can help your body torch fat all day, then send your body into fat-melt mode all night, while you sleep peacefully.</p>
<p><strong>Just look at what our clients have to say about this fat-blasting stack..</strong></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When I’m specifically trying to gain strength or size through my entire body, I rotate through this 5-day workout routine.</p>
<p>In this article:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="#chest">Day 1: Chest</a></li>
<li><a href="#back">Day 2: Back</a></li>
<li><a href="#legs">Day 3: Legs</a></li>
<li><a href="#arms">Day 4: Arms</a></li>
<li><a href="#shoulders">Day 5: Shoulders</a></li>
</ol>
<h2>5 Day Weekly Workout Routine</h2>
<p>When I prescribe workouts for my clients, I always make sure I’ve done each and every one of the exercises as well as the routine itself to make sure it works the muscles I want to be working, to make sure it’s set at the proper difficulty, and to make sure I’ve done a run through for when questions arise. I do change up my workout routines from time to time, but in general, my <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/weight-training-beginners/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">weight training</a> stays relatively consistent.</p>
<p>Based on the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) guidelines for resistance training, if you’re trying to gain strength or size, it’s ideal to hit each major muscle group at least twice a week. <strong>Major muscle groups include chest, core, arms, shoulders, back, and legs.</strong> Because of these guidelines, I have a couple of different routines I go through. Below is one of my primary weekly routines.</p>
<div id="chest">

<p>In addition to my weekly routine of weight training, all of my lifting is followed up by at least 20 minutes of <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/full-cardio-workout-done-in-only-4-minutes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cardio</a>. I’ll generally do <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/hiit-workout-plan-burn-calories-in-4-minutes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HIIT training</a> if it’s only 20-25 minutes of cardio. Anything that hits 30 minutes of cardio generally entails more steady-state cardio. I aim to get at least 2 miles on the treadmill during my cardio sessions.</p>
<p><strong>Complete this weekly routine, take your supplements, and watch your body put on muscle and lose body fat week by week. Tell us about your journey in the comments below.</strong></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Check out this step-by-step workout routine to start weight training for beginners.</p>
<h2>Weight Training for Beginners | Complete Workout Guide</h2>
<h3>Step 1: Front Squat</h3>
<p><!-- instagram error: invalid instagram resource --></p>
<p>Front squats are one of the best weight training exercises that target the quads and lower back. Compared to back squats which hit the glutes, front squats focus on the quads.</p>
<p>It’s definitely one of the best weight training workouts for leg muscle mass.</p>
<ul>
<li>Stand inside a squat rack and set the barbell parallel to your chest.</li>
<li>Position yourself under the bar so the weight rests across your front deltoids.</li>
<li>After you’ve positioned the bar, place your hands under the bar so your palms are facing upward. Push your elbows upward until your upper arms are parallel to the floor. This will be your grip all throughout the exercise.</li>
<li>Once you’ve established a firm grip on the bar, lift the weight off the rack, keep your feet shoulder-width apart, and take two steps away from the rack. This will be your starting position.</li>
<li>Slowly lower your torso by bending your knees until your thighs are parallel to the floor.</li>
<li>Next, push your body back up to the starting position.</li>
<li>Do two to three sets of eight reps.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Step 2: Three-Point Dumbbell Row</h3>
<p><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/2Y7qgP6LyBwgQE9yzJ"><img src="https://i1.wp.com/media.giphy.com/media/2Y7qgP6LyBwgQE9yzJ/giphy.gif?resize=480%2C270&#038;ssl=1" alt="Animated GIF - Find &amp; Share on GIPHY" width="480" height="270" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>Three-point dumbbell rows are weight training exercises that primarily hit your lats. At the same time, they also work your lower traps and rhomboids.</p>
<p>Also, if you want to do weight training at home, all you’ll need for this exercise is a pair of dumbbells.</p>
<ul>
<li>Place your dumbbells on each side of a flat bench.</li>
<li>Position your right knee on the bench then bend your body forward until your torso is parallel to the floor. Place your right hand on the bench for support</li>
<li>Use your left hand to pick up the dumbbell on your left side.</li>
<li>Keeping your elbows close to your body, pull the weight up to your chest.</li>
<li>Lower the weight back down. This counts as one rep</li>
<li>Do two sets of 12 reps on each side.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Step 3: Push-Up</h3>
<p><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/vxpCVLOUAqMSQ30bQK"><img src="https://i0.wp.com/media.giphy.com/media/vxpCVLOUAqMSQ30bQK/giphy.gif?resize=480%2C270&#038;ssl=1" alt="Animated GIF - Find &amp; Share on GIPHY" width="480" height="270" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>If you’re just beginning with weight training, push-ups might be one of the first exercises you’ll learn to do. They’re a great beginner weight training exercise you can do at home.</p>
<p>The standard push-up primarily targets the chest muscles. But it also works the shoulders, deltoids, and triceps.</p>
<ul>
<li>Place your hands on the ground around shoulder-width apart. Keep your legs together and extended behind you.</li>
<li>Once you’ve positioned yourself, slowly lower your torso until you&#8217;re about an inch away from the floor.</li>
<li>Push yourself back up to the starting position.</li>
<li>Do two sets of 12 to 15 reps.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Step 4: Single-Leg Bridge</h3>
<p><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/9GIimTyzMWtNNz7nMa"><img src="https://i0.wp.com/media.giphy.com/media/9GIimTyzMWtNNz7nMa/giphy.gif?resize=480%2C270&#038;ssl=1" alt="Animated GIF - Find &amp; Share on GIPHY" width="480" height="270" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>If you’re weight training for weight loss, then this exercise is perfect for you. While the single-leg bridge primarily works your glutes, it’s also a great core-strengthening exercise.</p>
<p>The single-leg bridge is also a great workout to <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/3-exercises-for-abs-best-oblique-exercises-for-a-six-pack/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sculpt those washboard abs</a> you’ve always wanted.</p>
<ul>
<li>Lie on your back with your feet planted on the ground and your knees bent.</li>
<li>Raise your left leg and extend it in front of you. This will be your starting position.</li>
<li>Drive your heel to the ground to push your hips upward.</li>
<li>Slowly lower your body back down. This counts as one rep.</li>
<li>Do two sets of 12 reps on each leg.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Step 5: Dumbbell Pullover</h3>
<p><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/3divoXWOpAzOFc7igq"><img src="https://i2.wp.com/media.giphy.com/media/3divoXWOpAzOFc7igq/giphy.gif?resize=480%2C270&#038;ssl=1" alt="Animated GIF - Find &amp; Share on GIPHY" width="480" height="270" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>Dumbbell pullovers primarily work your pecs but your back muscles also assist all throughout the exercise. While performing this workout, remember to maintain a slow, controlled tempo.</p>
<ul>
<li>Hold a dumbbell with both your hands then lie down on a flat bench.</li>
<li>Raise the dumbbell upward in front of you. This will be your starting position.</li>
<li>Slowly lower the weight behind your head as far back as possible.</li>
<li>Lift the weight back up while flexing your pecs.</li>
<li>Do two sets of 12 reps.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Step 6: Plank</h3>
<p><!-- instagram error: invalid instagram resource --></p>
<p>All the best weight training routines incorporate some kind of core exercise at the end. Doing planks is a great way to strengthen your abs, back, and core.</p>
<p>If you’re strength training for <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/best-supplements-for-weight-loss/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">weight loss</a>, you can add this exercise to your other routines. It may seem easy but it takes a lot of strength and endurance to hold a plank position.</p>
<ul>
<li>Get into a push-up position but with your forearms on the ground and elbows bent at 90°.</li>
<li>Your body should be parallel to the ground.</li>
<li>Hold this position for 60 seconds.</li>
<li>Do two sets of 60-second planks.</li>
</ul>

<p>These are just the <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/strength-training/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">basics of weight training</a> for beginners. Once you get the hang of weightlifting, you can further maximize the benefits of weight training by committing to a <a href="https://vshred.com/programs/custom-training-and-diet-plan-8-week?ref=programs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">customized regimen</a>.</p>
<p>Similarly, you can opt to challenge your body by taking on more difficult workout routines. What’s important is that you follow a fitness plan that suits your lifestyle and meets your needs.</p>

<p>As such, it&#8217;ll tell you what to eat, when to eat, and how much to eat. You&#8217;ll also be taking the guesswork out of your workout sessions since the program will prescribe the exercises you&#8217;ll do as well as how many times you&#8217;ll repeat it.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Truth is, there are tons of workouts to choose from. But if you’re looking to separate the best workout to lose weight from the rest, this workout will end your quest.</p>
<div class="embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9 mb-5">
<!-- iframe plugin v.4.4 wordpress.org/plugins/iframe/ -->
<iframe src="//youtube.com/embed/TAxI7YbZqBU" class="embed-responsive-item box-shadow-wide" width="100%" height="500" scrolling="yes" frameborder="0"></iframe>
</div>
<p class="p1">There are a few major factors that help determine what the best workout to lose weight is for you.</p>
<p class="p1">While those determining factors may differ from person to person, hopefully this workout includes a couple benefits that you like.</p>
<h3 class="p1">The Benefits</h3>
<ul>
<li class="p1">It only takes 4 minutes. So it’s not intimidating.</li>
<li class="p1">It’s a very simple workout. Only two exercises.</li>
<li class="p1">It burns tons of calories. During and after the workout.</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="p1">The Best Workout to Lose Weight</h2>
<p class="p1">This workout will only be two exercises. Each exercise will be performed for 20 seconds and followed up with a 10 second rest.</p>
<p class="p1">You will perform each exercise back to back until all 4 minutes are completed.</p>
<h3 class="p1">The Exercises</h3>
<h4 class="p1">Alternating Jumps with Reach</h4>
<p class="p1">For this exercise, you will start in pushup position. From there, you will hop your feet off the ground and hop one foot up near your hand with the other foot remaining back. Then hop again and switch feet. Do this as many times as you can for 20 seconds, then rest for 10 seconds.</p>
<h4 class="p1">Crab Toe Touches</h4>
<p class="p1">Here, you will flip over onto your butt and lift your butt off the ground with your hands and your feet. This is the crab position. From there, you will take one arm and the opposite leg and bring them up together at the top. Then return them back to the ground and switch arms and legs. Do this as many times as you can for 20 seconds and rest for 10 seconds.</p>
<p class="p1">After you have completed the entire four rounds of the workout, your workout will be over. It will not take long but it will be a great workout as long as you give it your all!</p>
<p class="p1">So try this workout and be sure to share it with your friends. Also, don’t forget to leave any comments down below!</p>

<h2 class="p1">4 Minute Cardio Workout</h2>
<p class="p1">In this workout, I take you through a quick, but effective workout to target body fat all over!</p>
<p class="p1">It&#8217;s going to be 4 exercises done for 20 seconds on with a 10 second rest. Then you&#8217;ll repeat each exercise twice to equal the full 4 minutes.</p>
<h3 class="p1">The Exercises:</h3>
<h4 class="p1">Half Burpees</h4>
<p class="p1">For this exercise, you will start down on the ground on your hands and feet. From there, you will jump your feet backs if going down for a burpee. Then jump your feet forward towards your hands like you’re going to jump up for a burpee. But instead of jumping up, jump your feet back out and repeat as many times as you can for 20 seconds. Then rest for 10 seconds and move onto the next exercise.</p>
<h4 class="p1">Jump Squats</h4>
<p class="p1">Here, you will get into a squat position, with your feet at shoulder width. From there, you will squat down, and starting from the bottom, you will explode up into a jump. Then land and go right back into your next squat. Repeat as many jump squats as you can for 20 seconds. Then rest for another 10 seconds and move onto the next exercise.</p>
<h4 class="p1">Bicycles</h4>
<p class="p1">This is a great ab exercise where you will start by laying on your back with your hands on the back of your head. From there, you will bring one knee up as high as you can, while crunching up and bringing one elbow down to meet your knee. Then repeat to the other side and do as many times as you can for 20 seconds. After this, rest for 10 seconds and move into the fourth and final exercise.</p>
<h4 class="p1">Spider Man Pushups</h4>
<p class="p1">Here, you will be doing an advanced variation of a pushup. Starting in a pushup position, you will lower yourself to the floor as you bring your knee up and out to the side. Bring it as close to your elbow as possible. Then as you press yourself back up, return your foot back to the starting position. Then repeat to the other side and do this as many times as you can for 20 seconds. If you already struggle with push-ups, don’t worry about the crunch and just do push-ups.</p>
<p class="p1">After completing all four exercises, you will rest for 10 seconds then repeat this cycle one more time.</p>
