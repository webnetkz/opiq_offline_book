<p>Summer is here and the sun is out! With the summer sun comes swimsuits, and swimsuits mean your body is going to be on full display.</p>
<p>Unlike the fellas, who can cover up their REAR VIEW in a pair of swim trunks, ladies have to expose it all.</p>
<p><em><strong>Not fair .. we know.</strong></em></p>
<p>BUT we’ve got you covered (so you can confidently be uncovered) &#8211; with a <em><strong>12-minute home glute workout</strong></em> &#8211; that will help you blast fat and build curves in all the right places!</p>
<p><em><strong>Speaking of the summer sun….</strong></em><br />
While the weather is pleasant, try leaving your living room and take your training outside!<br />
The fresh air and bright sunshine can be a great motivator to get moving!</p>
<p><em><strong>Studies say being outdoors….</strong></em></p>
<ul>
<li>Lowers stress hormones (which can impact things like appetite and weight)</li>
<li>Re-sets your ability to focus &amp; boosts creativity</li>
<li>Supports immune health</li>
<li>May help you burn a few more calories (because of the extra energy required.)</li>
<li>++ More</li>
</ul>
<p>Outdoor training may not be ideal for every workout, but the one we are showing you today is really short &#8211; only 12-minutes!</p>
<p>Don’t forget your sunscreen and plenty of water! Let’s get that summer booty poppin!</p>
<p>You don’t need any equipment for this workout, but if you have some weights or bands, feel free to add them.</p>
<p>We will perform all exercises as “super-sets” .. this means you will do “Exercise A &amp; B” without any rest in-between. Then you will get a quick break before moving on to the next superset, and so on.</p>
<p>The reason we are doing supersets is to keep things moving. This keeps your heart-rate up and will ensure you are getting the most out of your time.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>12-Minute Follow Along Booty Movements </strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Each exercise will be performed for 20 Seconds. Your rest periods between supersets will also be a quick 20-seconds.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Even with expensive equipment designed to target glutes, access to heavy weights, and a booty building expert as a trainer&#8230; <em><strong>developing a better backside is NOT easy.</strong></em></p>
<p>The glutes are innately lazy, a very large muscle group, and need targeted isolation to achieve the activation required to change their shape and size.</p>
<p>Knowing this may lead you to wonder if you can REALLY build a butt at home with .. no machines, no weights, not even resistance bands. Literally nothing except a small space, your body, and your favorite gym shoes.</p>
<p><strong>Yes. You. Can.</strong> (In fact, shoes are totally optional for the workout below)</p>
<p>If your goal is to build lean muscle and re-shape your booty, it is IDEAL to use some form of resistance. But if you stay consistent, do the right exercises, and focus on FEELING your glutes activate with every movement… <em><strong>you don’t NEED anything except your own bodyweight!</strong></em></p>
<p>Of course, if you have dumbbells, a resistance band, kettlebells, or any sort of DIY home weights, adjust the reps or rest periods, and use them!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>GET A BUTT (from home)</strong><br />
<strong>With this booty blasting NO EQUIPMENT workout</strong></p>
<p><img class="wp-image-7046 size-full" src="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_287626739.jpeg?resize=1170%2C780&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1170" height="780" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_287626739.jpeg?w=5859&amp;ssl=1 5859w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_287626739.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_287626739.jpeg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_287626739.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_287626739.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_287626739.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1170px) 100vw, 1170px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><strong>BOOTY WARM UP</strong><br />
Even though you won&#8217;t be using weights for this booty blaster, we still advise you to warm up and <a href="https://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/static+stretch" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">stretch your muscles</a>. Glutes are the biggest muscles in your body. You never want to train “cold” muscles.</p>
<p>Do <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtNGW21016I" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">some DYNAMIC lower body stretching</a> followed by 5 total minutes of things like running in place, jumping jacks, body weight kick-backs, leg swings, and air squats.</p>
<p><strong>8 EXERCISE BOOTY BUILDING CIRCUIT</strong><br />
You will notice that rest time is very minimal. Because we aren’t using any weight, keeping constant stress on the glutes is even more important.</p>
<p>Equally important is being very intentional with every movement. Pay attention to TEMPO and PAUSES! A no-equipment workout is not the time to RUSH.</p>
<p>Focus on slowing things down and pausing at times when your glutes are placed under the most tension. <em><strong>Weight or not .. this is where the booty building magic happens!!</strong></em></p>
<p>Focus on making the most of every rep. If you are using mind-muscle connection, you will feel your glutes activating with each rep.</p>
<ul>
<li>Perform each exercise for 20-30 reps (or as many reps as it takes for you to be totally taxed.)</li>
<li>No Rest or VERY MINIMAL REST between exercises (20 seconds MAX.)</li>
<li>Once you complete the entire 8 exercise circuit, rest for 60 seconds, and then repeat for a total of 2-5 rounds.</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Exercise 1: Basic Squat</strong><br />
Stand with your feet about shoulder-width apart. Your toes should be straight forward and SLIGHTLY pointed out.</p>
<p>Keep your chest tall, pull your shoulder blades together, and keep your head up.</p>
<p>Slowly squat down by bending your knees. Keep your feet firmly planted into the floor and knees forward (don’t let them cave in.)</p>
<p>Go as low as you can go, but make sure your knees stay aligned over your feet. Never allow them to go beyond your toes!</p>
<p>Your tempo/pause technique for this movement … take at least 3 seconds during the lowering portion of the squat, pause or pulse for 2 seconds at the bottom, then rise up to the starting position and SQUEEZE your glutes HARD at the top!</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-7048" src="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_321190989.jpeg?resize=1170%2C780&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1170" height="780" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_321190989.jpeg?w=6685&amp;ssl=1 6685w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_321190989.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_321190989.jpeg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_321190989.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_321190989.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_321190989.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1170px) 100vw, 1170px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><strong>Exercise 2: Reverse Lunge</strong><br />
Stand with your feet about shoulder-width apart. Your toes should be straight forward.</p>
<p>Step your right foot back into a deep lunge. Make sure your left knee stays directly over your ankle, and bend your right knee, so it almost touches the floor.</p>
<p>Focus on your left glute as you step your right foot forward back to the starting position.</p>
<p>Repeat the same thing with the other leg. This counts as one rep. You can also do all reps on ONE side before going to the other side.</p>
<p>Your tempo for this movement should be slow and controlled during both the lowering and raising phases. If you want to pause while IN the lunged position, that will make this move more advanced. Do not rest/pause at the top of the movement.</p>

<p><strong>Exercise 3: Bulgarian Split Squats</strong><br />
You will need a slightly raised surface for this one. Anything that is about knee height.</p>
<p>If you find yourself struggling to stay balanced, hold on to a nearby wall, another piece of furniture, someone&#8217;s shoulder, etc.</p>
<p>Stand facing away from your raised surface. Don’t stand too close… that is not good for your knees. On the flip side, standing too far away could put strain on your hip flexors and groin. Generally, the further away you stand, the more hamstring and glute focused it will be. Find your sweet spot!</p>
<p>Keep your core tight, your torso upright, and your hips square to your body.</p>
<p>Hold on to whatever you are using for balance and place your back foot on the elevated surface.</p>
<p>Lower into a lunge, keeping your front knee in line with your front foot. Don&#8217;t let your front knee travel beyond your toes. Your back leg will be resting on the elevated surface and will naturally bend as you lunge.</p>
<p>Drive up through your front heel back to the starting position. Not your back leg. All the work should be on the leg that is out front.</p>
<p>Do all reps on one side &#8211; then switch and do the other leg!</p>
<p>Your tempo/pause technique for this movement will be the same as the reverse lunges.</p>

<p><strong>Exercise 4: Single Leg Foot Elevated Glute Bridge</strong><br />
Head to the floor. You will use the same raised surface you used for the split squats, for these feet elevated glute bridges.</p>
<p>Lay down on your back. With your knees bent, place your feet on the elevated surface. Scoot your body closer or further away to your raised surface. Distance is individual. Just make sure you are in a position to perform the movement with proper form and a good range of motion.</p>
<p>Plant your left foot onto the elevated surface and extend only your right leg into the air. You will be pushing through your left foot .. your right leg will stay extended.</p>
<p>Lift your hips and squeeze your left glute as you push up into a bridge position until your hips are fully extended. When extending into the glute bridge, do not arch your back! Go up just high enough that you are making a long diagonal line from your shoulders to your knee.</p>
<p>Slowly lower back down. Do all reps on one side, then switch legs and do the other side.</p>
<p>Your tempo/pause technique for this movement will be slow and controlled on both the way up and down .. with a big squeeze at the top of the movement .. and no rest at the bottom.</p>

<p><strong>Exercise 5: Side Lying Clam Raise</strong><br />
Roll over to one side. Bend your knees 90 degrees. Your knees and feet should be stacked on top of each other.</p>
<p>Come up on to your forearm so that your hips are hovering over the ground. You can place the other hand on your hip/glutes. Push through your heel as you raise up and rotate your hips open. You will raise your top knee until it points up toward the ceiling (like a clamshell opening.)</p>
<p>Reverse the movement as you return to the starting position. Repeat all reps on one side before rolling over and doing the same on the other side.</p>
<p>Try to never let your hips touch the floor until you have completed all reps. If this is too difficult for you, you can allow your hips to touch the floor between each rep, or as needed.</p>
<p>Your tempo/pause technique for this movement will be slow and controlled on both the way up and down .. with a big squeeze at the top of the movement .. and no rest at the bottom.</p>

<p><strong>Exercise 6: Fire Hydrants</strong><br />
Get on all fours in a tabletop position. Make sure your shoulders are above your hands and your hips above your knees.</p>
<p>Lift your left leg away from your body at a 45-degree angle, keeping your knee at 90 degrees and don’t shift your hips. Squeeze your glutes at the top of the movement and then lower back to the starting position.</p>
<p>Your tempo/pause technique for this movement will be slow and controlled as you raise and lower .. with a big squeeze at the top of the movement .. and no rest at the bottom.</p>

<p><strong>Exercise 7: Kneeling Donkey Kick Ups</strong><br />
Stay in your tabletop position. Lift one leg up behind you while keeping your knee bent.</p>
<p>You should do this in a slow and controlled manner, not using ANY momentum to “kick” your leg up. Focus and let your glute muscle do the lifting!</p>
<p>Keep your foot flexed and raise/pulse your leg until it is in line with your body, and your foot is parallel to the ceiling. This should be a short range of motion. Keep your back still with a neutral spine (don’t arch.)</p>
<p>Your tempo/pause technique for this movement will be slow and controlled as you raise and lower .. with a big squeeze at the top of the movement .. and no rest at the bottom.</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-7054" src="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_212749185.jpeg?resize=1170%2C781&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1170" height="781" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_212749185.jpeg?w=7360&amp;ssl=1 7360w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_212749185.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_212749185.jpeg?resize=768%2C513&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_212749185.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_212749185.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_212749185.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1170px) 100vw, 1170px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><strong>Exercise 8: Shock Pulses</strong><br />
This one is going to sound strange… but it works!</p>
<p>Stand up with your feet about shoulder-width apart (or slightly more narrow.)</p>
<p>All you are going to do is aggressively squeeze your glutes together in a quick “shock” type movement. You will move quickly and do at least 20-30 “shocks” (squeezing as hard as you can every “shock”.)</p>
<p>On every 5th shock pulse .. stop and HOLD THE SQUEEZE AS HARD AS YOU CAN for 5 seconds. No rest .. just keep on shocking and holding .. until you can’t do another rep!</p>
<p>Your glutes will be ON FIRE when you are done!</p>
<p><strong>BOOTY COOL DOWN</strong><br />
When you are done, it’s time to lower your heart rate and give your glutes the recovery they need to repair and grow.</p>
<p>The best way to do this is to spend at least 10 minutes doing <a href="https://glnk.io/nrzp/stacymccloud" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">self myofascial release</a> and <a href="https://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/static+stretch" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">static stretching</a>.</p>
<p>While you are cooling down, you may also want to sip on some <a href="https://sculptnation.com/products/bcaas" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sculpt Nation BCAAS</a> or our <a href="https://sculptnation.com/products/post-workout-fruit-punch" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">POST WORKOUT</a> blend! Both have their own unique blend of post workout recovery support agents that will get you into recovery mode faster and promote a decrease in soreness so you can be ready to crush your next workout!</p>
<p><strong>**TIPS TO MAKE THIS BOOTY BURNER EASIER**</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Use a more shallow range of motion.</li>
<li>Take longer rest periods.</li>
<li>Decrease reps/rounds.</li>
<li>Shorter pauses/faster tempo (not recommended)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>**TIPS TO MAKE THIS BOOTY BURNER MORE DIFFICULT**</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Add weight. If you don&#8217;t have any, look around your house! There are plenty of objects you can use to add resistance (water bottles, detergent, canned foods, a stuffed backpack, etc.)</li>
<li>Minimize rest periods or make them “active rest” by doing jumping jacks, burpees, mountain climbers, jump rope, jump squats, etc.</li>
<li>Add pulses,¼ reps, squeeze harder, make tempo even slower, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>GUYS .. WE HOPE YOU ARE PAYING ATTENTION</strong><br />
Glute training at home is not just for the ladies!</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-7055" src="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_222095725.jpeg?resize=1170%2C780&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1170" height="780" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_222095725.jpeg?w=5616&amp;ssl=1 5616w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_222095725.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_222095725.jpeg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_222095725.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_222095725.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_222095725.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1170px) 100vw, 1170px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>Just like women should train body parts that guys tend to focus on (biceps and chest, for example) &#8212; <em><strong>every person reading this can benefit from isolated glute training!</strong></em></p>
<p>Glutes are the powerhouse of your body! Focusing on glutes goes beyond aesthetic benefits!<br />
Strong glutes…</p>
<ul>
<li>Help improve posture.</li>
<li>Support functional movements (walking, etc.)</li>
<li>Can improve your squat and deadlift.</li>
<li>Lowers the chance of injury to your back and knees.</li>
<li>Help keep lower body joints healthy (hips, knees, and ankles.)</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: left;"><em><strong>Don’t let lack of equipment be your excuse!</strong></em> You don’t have to have a fancy gym or even home gym equipment to get a good glute workout. Use this workout when you are limited!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>If you want to take out the guesswork.. let us do the heavy lifting for you!</strong></em><br />

<h2>5-Move Leg Day Regimen | Hardcore Full Leg Workout Routine</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>1. Barbell Squats</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-5256 size-full" src="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Barbell-Squats-full-leg-workout.jpg?resize=625%2C349&#038;ssl=1" alt="Barbell Squats | V Shred's Ultimate Full Leg Workout" width="625" height="349" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Barbell-Squats-full-leg-workout.jpg?w=625&amp;ssl=1 625w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Barbell-Squats-full-leg-workout.jpg?resize=300%2C168&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><strong>Reps</strong>: 20</p>
<p><strong>Sets:</strong> 3</p>
<p><strong>Muscles Worked:</strong> Quads, glutes</p>
<p>Our full leg workout routine starts off with some <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/how-to-do-squats-exercises-for-knee-pain/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">barbell squats</a>. They’re a strength-training movement that works the whole body with an emphasis on your quads and glutes.</p>
<p>The number one thing to remember when squatting is proper form. Remember: the quality of your reps will always outweigh the volume or quantity.</p>
<ul>
<li>Place a loaded bar across your traps, position your feet shoulder-width apart, point your toes forward, and arch your hips out. This will be your starting position.</li>
<li>With your hips coming down first, lower your body until your knees bend at a 90-degree angle. Remember to keep all the weight on your heels and to push your chest out as your body descends.</li>
<li>From here, push your body back up using your leg muscles. This counts as one rep.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> You don’t necessarily need to go ass to grass when squatting. Going further than a 90-degree bend will put an unnecessary strain on your back.</p>
<h3>2. Leg Press</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-5257 size-full" src="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Leg-Press-full-leg-workout.jpg?resize=625%2C349&#038;ssl=1" alt="Leg Press | V Shred's Ultimate Full Leg Workout" width="625" height="349" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Leg-Press-full-leg-workout.jpg?w=625&amp;ssl=1 625w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Leg-Press-full-leg-workout.jpg?resize=300%2C168&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><strong>Reps:</strong> 20 to 30</p>
<p><strong>Sets:</strong> 5</p>
<p><strong>Muscles Worked:</strong> Outer quads, hamstrings</p>
<p>When doing leg presses, your goal should be to achieve a pump in your leg muscles. Do multiple reps of a weight you’re comfortable with to distribute sufficient blood and oxygen to the right muscle groups.</p>
<ul>
<li>Sit down on the leg press machine and prop your feet up on the platform in front of you. This is the optimal foot placement to target your outer quads.</li>
<li>Push the platform up using your legs. Remember not to fully straighten your legs. They should slightly bend to avoid leg injury.</li>
<li>Next, lower the weight down until your knees bend at a 90-degree angle. During this part, you’ll feel your outer quads and hamstrings contract.</li>
<li>Push the weight back up using your legs. Again, remember to not overextend your legs or lock them at the knees. This counts as one rep.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> Similar to barbell squats, you don’t necessarily need to go all the way down. Stop when your knees bend at a 90-degree angle to avoid straining your lower back.</p>
<h3>3. Walking Lunges</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-5258 size-full" src="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Walking-Lunges-full-leg-workout.jpg?resize=625%2C351&#038;ssl=1" alt="Walking Lunges | V Shred's Ultimate Full Leg Workout" width="625" height="351" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Walking-Lunges-full-leg-workout.jpg?w=625&amp;ssl=1 625w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Walking-Lunges-full-leg-workout.jpg?resize=300%2C168&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><strong>Reps:</strong> 10 each leg</p>
<p><strong>Sets:</strong> 5</p>
<p><strong>Muscles Worked:</strong> Quads</p>
<p>Walking lunges are a great addition to our killer leg workout routine. It’s a dynamic exercise that targets your quads every step of the way –literally.</p>
<ul>
<li>Place the bar across your traps, place your feet shoulder-width apart, and balance your entire weight on your heels. This will be your starting position.</li>
<li>Take a step forward with your left foot then lower your torso until your right knee almost touches the ground and your left thigh is parallel to the ground.</li>
<li>Lift yourself up by driving your heel to the ground then do the same with your other leg.</li>
<li>While doing walking lunges, keep the weight at the back, not the front. Also, push your chest out as you’re lunging.</li>
</ul>
<h3>4. Romanian Deadlifts</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-5259 size-full" src="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Romanian-Deadlifts-full-leg-workout.jpg?resize=625%2C353&#038;ssl=1" alt="Romanian Deadlifts | V Shred's Ultimate Full Leg Workout" width="625" height="353" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Romanian-Deadlifts-full-leg-workout.jpg?w=625&amp;ssl=1 625w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Romanian-Deadlifts-full-leg-workout.jpg?resize=300%2C169&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><strong>Reps:</strong> 15 to 20</p>
<p><strong>Sets:</strong> 3</p>
<p><strong>Muscles Worked:</strong> Hamstrings, glutes</p>
<p>Romanian deadlifts are great exercises to <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/hamstring-workouts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">strengthen your hamstrings</a>. You should feel the movement from the bottom of your legs to your glutes.</p>
<ul>
<li>Stand upright with a loaded barbell in front of you, arms at the sides, and feet shoulder-width apart.</li>
<li>Lift the weight up with a shoulder-width-apart grip and let it hang just below your pelvis. Next, slowly lower the weight down while keeping your legs stiff.</li>
<li>As you lower the weight, push your butt back as far as you can. The key here is to make full-range movements. Go all the way down and extend all the way up.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> Form is very important. Keep your hips in and chest out. Get one of them wrong and you might pull a muscle and injure yourself.</p>
<h3>5. Calves</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-5260 size-full" src="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Calves-full-leg-workout.jpg?resize=625%2C349&#038;ssl=1" alt="Calves | V Shred's Ultimate Full Leg Workout" width="625" height="349" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Calves-full-leg-workout.jpg?w=625&amp;ssl=1 625w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Calves-full-leg-workout.jpg?resize=300%2C168&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><strong>Reps:</strong> 20 to 40</p>
<p><strong>Sets:</strong>  3 to 5</p>
<p><strong>Muscles Worked:</strong> Calves</p>
<p>The main trick to growing your calf muscles is to do enough high-quality reps. That’s why we want to perform three to five sets of 20 to 40 reps per leg day.</p>
<ul>
<li>Sit down on the leg press machine and place your feet on the bottom part of the platform.</li>
<li>Only the balls of your feet should press against it. Your heels should be hanging off of it.</li>
<li>Push the weight up as if you are tiptoeing, using the balls of your feet, while keeping your legs straight in front of you. Lower it back down using the same muscles. This counts as one rep.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Tip</strong>: You can also do these leg workouts with dumbbells. Make sure that you feel the contraction in your calf muscles. In fact, it’s not about the weight, it’s more about muscle contraction.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When I’m specifically trying to gain strength or size through my entire body, I rotate through this 5-day workout routine.</p>
<p>In this article:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="#chest">Day 1: Chest</a></li>
<li><a href="#back">Day 2: Back</a></li>
<li><a href="#legs">Day 3: Legs</a></li>
<li><a href="#arms">Day 4: Arms</a></li>
<li><a href="#shoulders">Day 5: Shoulders</a></li>
</ol>
<h2>5 Day Weekly Workout Routine</h2>
<p>When I prescribe workouts for my clients, I always make sure I’ve done each and every one of the exercises as well as the routine itself to make sure it works the muscles I want to be working, to make sure it’s set at the proper difficulty, and to make sure I’ve done a run through for when questions arise. I do change up my workout routines from time to time, but in general, my <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/weight-training-beginners/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">weight training</a> stays relatively consistent.</p>
<p>Based on the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) guidelines for resistance training, if you’re trying to gain strength or size, it’s ideal to hit each major muscle group at least twice a week. <strong>Major muscle groups include chest, core, arms, shoulders, back, and legs.</strong> Because of these guidelines, I have a couple of different routines I go through. Below is one of my primary weekly routines.</p>
<div id="chest">

<p>In addition to my weekly routine of weight training, all of my lifting is followed up by at least 20 minutes of <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/full-cardio-workout-done-in-only-4-minutes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cardio</a>. I’ll generally do <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/hiit-workout-plan-burn-calories-in-4-minutes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HIIT training</a> if it’s only 20-25 minutes of cardio. Anything that hits 30 minutes of cardio generally entails more steady-state cardio. I aim to get at least 2 miles on the treadmill during my cardio sessions.</p>

<h2>Leg Exercises | 6 Good Reasons You Should Not Skip Them</h2>
<div id="leg" class="anchor"></div>
<h3><span style="color: #000080;">1. Leg Toning Exercises Will Boost Your Metabolism</span></h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-4248 size-full" src="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/sports-workout-legday-legs-leg-exercises-px.jpg?resize=625%2C400&#038;ssl=1" alt="Leg Toning Exercises Will Boost Your Metabolism | The Benefits Of Leg Exercises | Why You Shouldn’t Skip Leg Days" width="625" height="400" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/sports-workout-legday-legs-leg-exercises-px.jpg?w=625&amp;ssl=1 625w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/sports-workout-legday-legs-leg-exercises-px.jpg?resize=300%2C192&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>Leg exercises help <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/how-to-gain-muscle-mass/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">build muscles</a>. Bigger muscles require more energy to move around, so you burn more calories in the process.</p>
<p>In fact, if using calories is the goal, <a href=" https://vshred.com/blog/strength-training/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">strength training</a> is the way to go. It performs better than all the following when it comes to keeping your metabolism going:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rowing</li>
<li>Cycling</li>
<li>Running</li>
<li>Other cardio exercises</li>
</ul>
<p>Whether your goal is to build strength or lose weight, effective leg workouts will have a big impact on the success of your efforts.</p>
<div id="best" class="anchor"></div>
<h3><span style="color: #000080;">2. The Best Leg Exercises Can Relieve Low Back Pain</span></h3>
<p>Your entire workout routine may <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/what-causes-lower-back-pain-workout/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cause pain in the back</a>. It is often the result of weak stabilizing muscles.</p>
<p>Core and leg strengthening exercises are key to minimizing back pain due to exercise. The routines can work on the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://vshred.com/blog/glute-workouts-home-gym/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Glutes</a></li>
<li>Hip flexors</li>
<li>Quadriceps</li>
<li>Hamstrings</li>
</ul>
<p>Be warned, though. Failing to focus on proper form during leg-day exercises could result in greater risks of back pain or injuries.</p>
<p>Focus on your movements. Follow a healthy regimen of leg exercises at home or at the gym to reduce or prevent back pain.</p>
<p>Do these first before increasing your intensity or adding more weight to your workout routine.</p>
<div id="exercises" class="anchor"></div>
<h3><span style="color: #000080;">3. Leg Exercises Improve Overall Athleticism</span></h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-4249 size-full" src="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/football-clip-football-boots-soccer-leg-exercises-pb.jpg?resize=625%2C400&#038;ssl=1" alt="Leg Exercises Improve Overall Athleticism | The Benefits Of Leg Exercises | Why You Shouldn’t Skip Leg Days" width="625" height="400" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/football-clip-football-boots-soccer-leg-exercises-pb.jpg?w=625&amp;ssl=1 625w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/football-clip-football-boots-soccer-leg-exercises-pb.jpg?resize=300%2C192&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>If you want to be a better athlete, you must invest time, effort, and energy in good leg exercises. You can excel in many sports when you improve the strength of the lower half of your body.</p>
<p>These include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Soccer</li>
<li>Basketball</li>
<li>Football</li>
<li>Baseball</li>
<li>Hockey</li>
<li>Cross-country skiing</li>
<li>Track and field</li>
</ul>
<p>Leg exercises can enhance even gymnastics performances. Those leg-day workouts help build strength and endurance and allow you to run faster and jump higher.</p>
<div id="build" class="anchor"></div>
<h3><span style="color: #000080;">4. Build Better Balance with Leg Exercises</span></h3>
<p>Balance is important, and leg exercises can help improve it. Routines <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/deadlift-proper-form/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">such as deadlifts</a> and side lunges can maintain your stability and let you gain better control of your body.</p>
<div id="routines" class="anchor"></div>
<h3><span style="color: #000080;">5. Leg Routines Increase Production of Growth Hormone and Testosterone</span></h3>
<p><!-- instagram error: invalid instagram resource --></p>
<p>Science points out leg exercises such as deadlifts and squats can increase the production of testosterone and human growth hormones.</p>
<p>Testosterone can be instrumental in building muscles and fighting fat while human growth hormone offers a wealth of benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fighting aging</li>
<li>Reducing body fat</li>
<li>Increasing bone density</li>
<li>Improving endurance</li>
<li>Building muscle</li>
</ul>
<p>These make leg exercises a powerful tool to improve your health, maintain your youth and vitality, and enhance long-term health and performance.</p>
<div id="strengthening" class="anchor"></div>
<h3><span style="color: #333399;">6. Leg Strengthening Exercises Increase Running Performance</span></h3>
<p>Whether you run for sport, exercise, or as a hobby, leg strengthening exercises can improve your performance. You also get additional benefits.</p>
<p>When you strengthen the lower part of your body, you can also excel in cycling, swimming, and various other sports. Runtastic cites well-trained legs as essential tools for building a strong back and core, which improves running at all levels.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Many people tend to ignore hamstring workouts when exercising their legs. However, hamstrings are very important for knee flexion, lower back health, and overall explosive leg strength.</p>
<p>If you’ve been slacking off on working your hammies, then you’re missing out on a lot of gains! Check out these exercises for hamstrings you must work on right away.</p>
<h2>Leg Day Game Changer: Top 7 Hamstring Workouts</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span style="color: #000080;">1. Lying Leg Curls</span></h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2859" src="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/attractive-young-man-doing-lying-leg-hamstring-workouts-ss.jpg?resize=625%2C418&#038;ssl=1" alt="Lying Leg Curls | Hamstring Workouts To Strengthen Your Legs | exercises for hamstrings" width="625" height="418" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/attractive-young-man-doing-lying-leg-hamstring-workouts-ss.jpg?w=625&amp;ssl=1 625w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/attractive-young-man-doing-lying-leg-hamstring-workouts-ss.jpg?resize=300%2C201&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px" data-recalc-dims="1" /><br />
Lying leg curls are one of the most basic machine exercises for hamstrings. It’s very easy to do and every gym probably has this machine.</p>
<p><strong>How To:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Lie on the machine face down.</li>
<li>Press your calves against the foam of the curl machine.</li>
<li>Curl your knees upward towards your glutes.</li>
<li>Do 3 sets of 12 to 15 reps.</li>
</ul>
<h3><span style="color: #000080;">2. Romanian Deadlift</span></h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2899" src="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/young-shirtless-man-doing-deadlift-exercise-hamstring-workouts-ss.jpg?resize=625%2C417&#038;ssl=1" alt="Romanian Deadlift | Hamstring Workouts To Strengthen Your Legs | machine exercises for hamstrings" width="625" height="417" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/young-shirtless-man-doing-deadlift-exercise-hamstring-workouts-ss.jpg?w=625&amp;ssl=1 625w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/young-shirtless-man-doing-deadlift-exercise-hamstring-workouts-ss.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px" data-recalc-dims="1" /><br />
The main difference between a Romanian and stiff-legged deadlift is that your butt will move backward. With other deadlift variations, your body moves vertically.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, a Romanian deadlift makes your body move horizontally.</p>
<p><strong>How To:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Hold a bar at about hip level while standing. Keep your back arched and knees slightly bent. This will be the starting position.</li>
<li>Slowly move your butt as far back as you can as you lower the barbell. Make sure that you’re looking forward throughout the exercise. Not up or down.</li>
<li>Slowly go back to the starting position by pulling your hips back.</li>
<li>Do 3 sets of 12 to 15 reps.</li>
</ul>
<h3><span style="color: #000080;">3. Clean Deadlift</span></h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2900" src="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/deadlift-hamstring-workouts-us.jpg?resize=625%2C417&#038;ssl=1" alt="Clean Deadlift | Hamstring Workouts To Strengthen Your Legs | hammies " width="625" height="417" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/deadlift-hamstring-workouts-us.jpg?w=625&amp;ssl=1 625w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/deadlift-hamstring-workouts-us.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px" data-recalc-dims="1" /><br />
If done right, <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/deadlift-proper-form/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the clean deadlift</a> is a powerful exercise that works out all major lower body muscles. Make sure to have a trainer spot you during your first attempts at deadlifting.</p>
<p><strong>How To:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Place a barbell close to your shins.</li>
<li>Squat down and grip the bar with a hook grip or a double overhand grip.</li>
<li>Keep your eyes straight and back vertical as possible.</li>
<li>Pull the weight upward using your leg muscles. The force should be on your heels.</li>
<li>Once the bar is above the knees, you can either slowly return the weight back down or drop it if your gym has the proper matting.</li>
<li>Do 3 sets of 3 to 5 reps.</li>
</ul>
<h3><span style="color: #000080;">4. Sumo Deadlift</span></h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2902" src="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/muscular-fitness-man-doing-deadlift-barbell-hamstring-workouts-ss.jpg?resize=625%2C418&#038;ssl=1" alt="Sumo Deadlift | Hamstring Workouts To Strengthen Your Legs" width="625" height="418" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/muscular-fitness-man-doing-deadlift-barbell-hamstring-workouts-ss.jpg?w=625&amp;ssl=1 625w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/muscular-fitness-man-doing-deadlift-barbell-hamstring-workouts-ss.jpg?resize=300%2C201&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px" data-recalc-dims="1" /><br />
The sumo deadlift, or wide stance deadlift, allows you to exercise your hamstrings with heavy weights. This is a great powerlifting move that increases both lower body strength and mass.</p>
<p><strong>How To:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Place a loaded bar on the floor. Make sure your feet are far from each other.</li>
<li>Lower your body by bending at the hips to grip the bar. Your arms should be inside your legs.</li>
<li>Afterward, lower your hips then drive your heels through the floor to lift the weight up. Lean back as the bar passes the knees.</li>
<li>Slowly return the weight back on the ground.</li>
<li>Do 3 sets of 5 to 7 reps.</li>
</ul>
<h3><span style="color: #000080;">5. Glute Bridge</span></h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2861" src="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/fitness-man-doing-bodyweight-glute-floor-hamstring-workouts-ss.jpg?resize=625%2C417&#038;ssl=1" alt="Glute Bridge | Hamstring Workouts To Strengthen Your Legs" width="625" height="417" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/fitness-man-doing-bodyweight-glute-floor-hamstring-workouts-ss.jpg?w=625&amp;ssl=1 625w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/fitness-man-doing-bodyweight-glute-floor-hamstring-workouts-ss.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px" data-recalc-dims="1" /><br />
The glute bridge is an easy hamstring exercise that can be used for warm-ups or cool-downs. However, don’t underestimate it just because it looks simple.</p>
<p>After a few reps of these, your hammies will be on fire.</p>
<p><strong>How To:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Lie on the floor with your knees bent.</li>
<li>Press your feet into the ground as you raise your hips toward the ceiling.</li>
<li>Once your hips are at the top, hold and flex it for about two seconds.</li>
<li>Slowly lower your hips back to the starting position.</li>
<li>Do 3 sets of 12 to 15 reps.</li>
</ul>
<h3><span style="color: #000080;">6. Bulgarian Split Squat</span></h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2910" src="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/gym-gymnasium-weights-weightlifting-hamstring-workout-us.jpg?resize=625%2C625&#038;ssl=1" alt="Bulgarian Split Squat | Hamstring Workouts To Strengthen Your Legs" width="625" height="625" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/gym-gymnasium-weights-weightlifting-hamstring-workout-us.jpg?w=625&amp;ssl=1 625w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/gym-gymnasium-weights-weightlifting-hamstring-workout-us.jpg?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 150w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/gym-gymnasium-weights-weightlifting-hamstring-workout-us.jpg?resize=300%2C300&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/gym-gymnasium-weights-weightlifting-hamstring-workout-us.jpg?resize=60%2C60&amp;ssl=1 60w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px" data-recalc-dims="1" /><br />
The Bulgarian split squat is an advanced exercise favored by many strength-training coaches. This hamstring workout is a full combination of flexibility and strength.</p>
<p>If you’re new to this exercise, it’s best to practice the form without the weights first.</p>
<p><strong>How To:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Find a bench that’s about as high as your knee and place it behind you.</li>
<li>Rest a loaded bar on your shoulders.</li>
<li>Position yourself as if you are about to do a forward lunge with your right leg. Place your left leg on top of the bench.</li>
<li>Lower your body until your left thigh is almost horizontal.</li>
<li>Do 10 reps then use your other leg. This counts as one set.</li>
<li>Do 3 sets of 12 to 15 reps.</li>
</ul>
<h3><span style="color: #000080;">7. Barbell Back Squat</span></h3>
<p><!-- instagram error: invalid instagram resource --></p>
<p>While it mainly targets your quads, <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/how-to-do-squats-exercises-for-knee-pain/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the squat</a> is an exercise that targets all major lower body muscle groups. No leg day workout will be complete without it.</p>
<p><strong>How To:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart with a barbell resting on your shoulders.</li>
<li>Lower your torso by bending your knees. Keep your head straight. Don’t look up or down. Also, remember to let your back arch a bit as your lower your body.</li>
<li>Lift your torso back up to the starting position.</li>
<li>Do 3 sets of 12 to 15 reps.</li>
</ul>

<iframe src="//youtube.com/embed/luffPlJiTHI" class="embed-responsive-item box-shadow-wide" width="100%" height="500" scrolling="yes" frameborder="0"></iframe>
</div>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://vshred.com/sp/survey/survey-aka1?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=post&amp;utm_campaign=v-shred&amp;utm_content=leg-day-workout-done-at-home-bodyweight-only&amp;utm_term=4" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>But after you do this workout, you need to make sure the rest of your workouts and your diet are taken care of. Use this free body type quiz to find out exactly how to get in shape faster and easier!</strong></a></p>
<p class="p1">Leg workouts are far from hard to find. But the best leg workout can be a little more difficult to figure out.</p>
<p class="p1">This one is a bunch of bodyweight exercises that maintain optimal tension on your muscles. Also, this is extremely effective for getting the right amount of volume that your legs need to get stronger and firmer!</p>
<h2 class="p1">The Best Leg Day Workout</h2>
<p class="p1">This leg day workout will consist of 5 different exercises. Each exercise will be performed for 3 sets of 15 reps with a one minute rest in between each set.</p>
<h3 class="p1">The Exercises</h3>
<h4 class="p1">Squat Rocks</h4>
<p class="p1">For this first exercise, you will start down in the bottom position of a squat. From there, you will remain as low as you can, while going forward and up on your toes. This should work your calves nicely. Then lower your heels back down to the ground. After your heels are back down, remain down in the squat position and shift your weight back on your heels and lift your toes off the ground. Then return your toes back to the ground and rock back and forth like this 15 times both ways. Then you will rest for one minute and repeat for 3 sets.</p>
<h4 class="p1">3 Point Lunges</h4>
<p class="p1">Here, you will be doing a series of lunges in 3 different directions. So starting by standing up straight, you will first lunge forward.. Then bring your foot back in, without touching it back on the ground, you will immediately go into a side lunge with that same leg. Then bring it back in and without touching it to the ground, immediately go into a back lunge. Then witch legs and do this with the opposite leg. After you have worked your way all the way around, that will be one rep. Repeat for 15 reps total and rest for a minute. Then do it twice more and move into the next exercise.</p>
<h4 class="p1">Frog Pumps</h4>
<p class="p1">This is a great exercise for the glutes and are very similar to glute bridges. You will start by laying on your back, then bring your feet in closer so your knees are similar to sit-up position. After that, you’ll bring your heels together so they are touching each other. Then drive your heels into the ground with your knees wider than your feet and bridge up as high as you can. Return your back back to about an inch off the ground and repeat for 15 reps.</p>
<h4 class="p1">4 Way Squat Hops</h4>
<p class="p1">For this exercise, you are going to be doing squat hops in four directions. So standing up straight, you will go down into a squat, then hop up off the ground to your left side. Then immediately go into a squat and hop up and jump back to where you just came from. Then squat down and hop to the right. Squat down hop back to the middle again. Then rather than going back to the left, you will squat down and hop forward. Then squat down again and hop back to the middle. Then as the last direction, you’ll squat down and hop backwards. Then squat down and hop back to the middle again. This will equal one rep. Repeat this left, right, forward and backward method for 15 total reps then rest for a minute. Repeat two more times and move into the final exercise.</p>
<h4 class="p1">Alternating Single Leg RDL Hops</h4>
<p class="p1">For the last exercise, you will start out by doing a single leg RDL. So starting off by balancing on one leg, you will bend forward, keeping a soft bend in your leg that on the ground, then bring your opposite leg going out behind you. Then tap your fingers to the ground and explode through your glutes and hamstrings to drive your back leg up and hop off the ground. Then after landing back on the ground, switch legs and do the exact same to the other side. Repeat for 15 reps with each leg. After you’ve done 15 reps, rest for a minute and repeat 2 more times.</p>
<p class="p1">Once all exercises are completed for 3 sets of 15 reps, you are done with the workout!</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Legs workouts need to include a variety of exercises because of the different muscles in your legs. Your leg exercises at home may not be working as well as you hope.</p>
<p>It may be time to try working those legs out at the gym. Include these gym exercises in your <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/ultimate-leg-day-workout/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">leg workout routine</a> to make the most out of your gym time.</p>
<h2>Make the Most Out of Your Legs Workouts</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span style="color: #000080;">Pre-Workout Supplement</span></h3>
<p>A pre-workout supplement goes great with your pre-workout meal to boost your performance at the gym. If you’re worried about staying up all night because of pre-workout stimulants, try<strong><a href="https://sculptnation.com/product/burn-pm/"> BurnPM</a>.</strong></p>
<p>It has a nitric oxide blend without any caffeine. It’ll help your circulation throughout the workout but will not affect your sleep.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #000080;">Warm-Up Your Leg Muscles</span></h3>
<p>When you get to the gym, spend the first 15 minutes warming up your leg muscles. Do 5 minutes of LISS cardio, then warm up your knees and stretch your hip flexors. This will help <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/muscles-cramping/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">prevent injury and cramps</a> by boosting the blood regulation into the muscles.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Exercises You Need in Your Legs Workouts</strong></span></h3>
<h3><span style="color: #000080;">1. Barbell Squats</span></h3>
<p><a href="https://gph.is/2JzudFG"><img src="https://i0.wp.com/media.giphy.com/media/5598GoyWiWsNRvSlDy/giphy.gif?resize=480%2C270&#038;ssl=1" alt="Animated GIF - Find &amp; Share on GIPHY" width="480" height="270" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><br />
<a href="https://vshred.com/blog/how-to-do-squats-exercises-for-knee-pain/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Squats are one of the essential</a> leg workout exercises for your knees and hamstrings. Place your shoulders under the barbell and lift it up off the rack.</p>
<p>Then slowly go down, careful not to let your knees go past your toes. This is to make sure you’re targeting your hamstrings instead of your knees. Do 4 sets of 12-15 reps each set.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #000080;">2. Barbell Reverse Squats</span></h3>
<p><a href="https://gph.is/2l5weLc"><img src="https://i1.wp.com/media.giphy.com/media/521QKG9KQayWXivr4B/giphy.gif?resize=480%2C270&#038;ssl=1" alt="Animated GIF - Find &amp; Share on GIPHY" width="480" height="270" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><br />
Barbell reverse squats are similar to normal barbell squats. But instead of squatting down, you step back with one foot and do a lunge. Do 4 sets for each leg with 10-15 reps in each set.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #000080;">3. Prone Hamstring Curls</span></h3>
<p><a href="https://gph.is/2Mnnj4e"><img src="https://i2.wp.com/media.giphy.com/media/555HcZbLGawJpnjHNl/giphy.gif?resize=480%2C270&#038;ssl=1" alt="Animated GIF - Find &amp; Share on GIPHY" width="480" height="270" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><br />
Lie down on the machine and make sure the weights are on the soleus muscle of your legs. To do this exercise in proper form, keep your toes pointed out and your chest down. Do 4 sets with 10-15 reps in each set.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #000080;">4. Seated Leg Extensions</span></h3>
<p><a href="https://gph.is/2t4pMrv"><img src="https://i0.wp.com/media.giphy.com/media/5zhgbZ5867VogA4b8I/giphy.gif?resize=480%2C270&#038;ssl=1" alt="Animated GIF - Find &amp; Share on GIPHY" width="480" height="270" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><br />
Seated leg extensions focus on the quads of your legs. To target your outer quad muscles, keep your feet wider apart than your knees, and keep them close to target the inner quad muscles. Do 4 sets with 10-15 reps in each set.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #000080;">5. Seated Straight Leg Calf Raises</span></h3>
<p><a href="https://gph.is/2y8TT6T"><img src="https://i2.wp.com/media.giphy.com/media/3IEfeCCodCt6zTpd5q/giphy.gif?resize=480%2C270&#038;ssl=1" alt="Animated GIF - Find &amp; Share on GIPHY" width="480" height="270" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><br />
Get on a seated calf machine for this exercise. Press your toes against the weight and press forward without using your knees. Make sure you stretch your calf during each rep. Do 4 sets with 10-15 reps in each set.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Watch the proper form for these exercises in this video from our youtube channel V Shred!</strong></p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='1170' height='659' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/cDKL94S51aM?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></p>
<p>You may have been working on your leg muscles for weeks now but barely see any significant results. This may be due to the wrong form or doing simple exercises which don&#8217;t engage the right leg muscles.</p>
<p>To make the most of your leg day workout, make sure you include these leg exercises to target different muscle groups in your legs. Most importantly, don’t forget to stretch in between every exercise and after your legs workouts to minimize the risk of fatigue or injury.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Your leg day workout is crucial in achieving a symmetrical, good looking physique. You don’t want to <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/types-muscles-bulk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">be a gym buff</a> with chicken legs, right? Follow this leg workout for mass building, and train your lower body like a champ!</p>
<h2>7-Part Leg Day Workout Routine for Increased Overall Leg Mass</h2>
<h3><strong><span style="color: #000080;">The Leg Mass Building Rule</span></strong></h3>
<p>Successful leg mass building relies on a 4-point rule. First, you must start the workout with the most <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/full-lower-body-6-pack-abs-workout-bodyweight-exercises-only/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">strenuous exercises</a> and the heaviest weights. Second, you have to hit the thighs from different angles. Third and fourth, you need to keep every routine’s volume high and train to muscle failure.</p>
<p><a href="https://vshred.com/sp/survey/survey-aka1" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4806" src="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/inline-5.png?resize=800%2C250&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="800" height="250" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/inline-5.png?w=800&amp;ssl=1 800w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/inline-5.png?resize=300%2C94&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/inline-5.png?resize=768%2C240&amp;ssl=1 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>This is a reverse-pyramid program to let you take more sets to muscle failure. We’ll be hitting four muscle groups — quads, calves, hamstrings, and glutes — in this mass-building workout. Ready to build and toughen up those chicken legs?</p>
<h3><span style="color: #000080;">1. Barbell Squat</span></h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-1575 size-full" src="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/squats.jpg?resize=625%2C417&#038;ssl=1" alt="Barbell Squat | Ultimate Leg Day Workout | No Chicken Legs! | leg workout" width="625" height="417" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/squats.jpg?w=625&amp;ssl=1 625w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/squats.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>(4 sets of 6-10 reps, lighten the load after the first 2 sets)</p>
<p>Make a hip-width stance with your toes facing slightly outward. Support the barbell on the top of your trap muscles, chest up, and head facing forward.</p>
<p>Bend your knees slowly, while driving them outward and keeping your back straightened. <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/how-to-do-squats-exercises-for-knee-pain/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hinge your hips</a> and your knees will move forward. Make sure the bar moves in a straight line up and down.</p>
<p>Slowly keep the weight on your heels and push up to go back to your initial position.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #000080;">2. Leg Press</span></h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-1576 size-full" src="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/leg-press.jpg?resize=625%2C417&#038;ssl=1" alt="Leg Press | Ultimate Leg Day Workout | No Chicken Legs! | leg workout for mass" width="625" height="417" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/leg-press.jpg?w=625&amp;ssl=1 625w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/leg-press.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>(4 sets of 8-10 reps)</p>
<p>Set the weight then sit on the machine placing your feet (shoulder width) on the footplate in front of you. Make sure to press your back firmly against the backrest.</p>
<p>To start, lower the footplate’s safety bar and press all the way up so that your legs are fully extended creating a 90-degree with your torso and legs. Remember to keep the knees bent slightly when extended to avoid injuries or accidents.</p>
<p>Slowly lower the footplate as you inhale to make a 90-degree angle with your upper and lower legs. Place the weight on your heels and push the plate back to your starting position. Finish your reps, and don’t forget to lock the safety pins after.</p>
<p>Tip: Put your feet up higher on the footplate to work your hams and glutes. Make sure your hands are always on the safety bars for your own protection.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #000080;">3. Dumbbell Walking Lunge</span></h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-1577 size-full" src="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/lunges-with-barbells.jpg?resize=625%2C417&#038;ssl=1" alt="Dumbbell Walking Lunge | Ultimate Leg Day Workout | No Chicken Legs! | leg workout routine" width="625" height="417" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/lunges-with-barbells.jpg?w=625&amp;ssl=1 625w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/lunges-with-barbells.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>(3 sets of 10-14 steps each side)</p>
<p>Begin with a hip-width stance holding a dumbbell in each hand.</p>
<p>Put one leg forward, bending your knees to lower your hips. Dip until your back knee nearly meets the floor. Keep an upright posture, and avoid moving your front knee past your toes to avoid injury.</p>
<p>Put your weight on your front foot’s heel and ascend from the lunge. Switch sides and repeat.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #000080;">4. Leg Extensions</span></h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-1578 size-full" src="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Leg-Extensions.jpg?resize=625%2C417&#038;ssl=1" alt="Leg Extensions | Ultimate Leg Day Workout | No Chicken Legs! | leg toning workouts" width="625" height="417" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Leg-Extensions.jpg?w=625&amp;ssl=1 625w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Leg-Extensions.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>(3 sets, 8-12 reps)</p>
<p>Set the load, sit on the machine keeping your legs hooked under the foot pads, and put your hands on the sidebars. Make sure that your upper and lower legs form a perfect 90-degree to avoid undue stress on your knees. Always keep your knees aligned with your toes.</p>
<p><a href="https://vshred.com/sp/survey/survey-aka1" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4810" src="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/inline-3.png?resize=800%2C250&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="800" height="250" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/inline-3.png?w=800&amp;ssl=1 800w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/inline-3.png?resize=300%2C94&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/inline-3.png?resize=768%2C240&amp;ssl=1 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>As you exhale, extend your legs fully using your quads. Keep your back flat on the padded seat during the movement. Pause and squeeze for a moment and then slowly retreat to your original position.</p>
<p>Repeat until you finish the set.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #000080;">5. Romanian Deadlift</span></h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-1579 size-full" src="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/dead-lift.jpg?resize=625%2C417&#038;ssl=1" alt="Romanian Deadlift | Ultimate Leg Day Workout | No Chicken Legs! | leg workouts at the gym" width="625" height="417" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/dead-lift.jpg?w=625&amp;ssl=1 625w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/dead-lift.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px" data-recalc-dims="1" /><br />
(3 sets, 8-12 reps)</p>
<p>Assume a shoulder-width stance while holding a bar with your palms facing down at a hip level. Arch your back, keep your shoulders back, and your knees bent slightly.</p>
<p>Move your buttocks back as far as you can as you lower the bar. Maintain the bar’s distance to your body while keeping your shoulders back, chest out and your head looking forward. Lower the bar down to about knee level, then drive the hips forward, and return to your initial position.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #000080;">6. Lying Leg Curls</span></h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-1580 size-full" src="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/laying-leg-curl.jpg?resize=625%2C417&#038;ssl=1" alt="Lying Leg Curls | Ultimate Leg Day Workout | No Chicken Legs! | leg workouts for men" width="625" height="417" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/laying-leg-curl.jpg?w=625&amp;ssl=1 625w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/laying-leg-curl.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>(3 sets 8-12 reps)</p>
<p>Lie face down on the machine and place your feet under the foot pad — a few inches below the calves. Grab the machine&#8217;s handle, keep your torso flat, and stretch your legs fully.</p>
<p>Keeping your upper legs on the pad, curl your legs as far as you can while you exhale. Pause for a second after fully curling your legs. Go back to the original position as you inhale.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #000080;">7. Standing Calf Raises</span></h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-1581 size-full" src="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/calf-raises.jpg?resize=625%2C405&#038;ssl=1" alt="Standing Calf Raises | Ultimate Leg Day Workout | No Chicken Legs! | killer leg workout" width="625" height="405" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/calf-raises.jpg?w=625&amp;ssl=1 625w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/calf-raises.jpg?resize=300%2C194&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>(4 set, 14-20 reps)</p>
<p>Set the calf raise machine to your height. Stand on the machine with your toes facing forward and your shoulders rested under the machine’s pads. Plant the balls of your feet firmly on the step with your heels extending over the edge.</p>
<p>As you exhale, raise your heels as high as you can, feeling your calves flex. Pause for a second and lower your heels to return to your initial position.</p>
<p><strong>Watch this video below for a leg day warm up to go perfectly with this workout: </strong><br />
<iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='1170' height='659' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/YJ63qDPcOZE?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></p>
