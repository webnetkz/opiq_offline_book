								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When I’m specifically trying to gain strength or size through my entire body, I rotate through this 5-day workout routine.</p>
<p>In this article:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="#chest">Day 1: Chest</a></li>
<li><a href="#back">Day 2: Back</a></li>
<li><a href="#legs">Day 3: Legs</a></li>
<li><a href="#arms">Day 4: Arms</a></li>
<li><a href="#shoulders">Day 5: Shoulders</a></li>
</ol>
<h2>5 Day Weekly Workout Routine</h2>
<p>When I prescribe workouts for my clients, I always make sure I’ve done each and every one of the exercises as well as the routine itself to make sure it works the muscles I want to be working, to make sure it’s set at the proper difficulty, and to make sure I’ve done a run through for when questions arise. I do change up my workout routines from time to time, but in general, my <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/weight-training-beginners/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">weight training</a> stays relatively consistent.</p>
<p>Based on the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) guidelines for resistance training, if you’re trying to gain strength or size, it’s ideal to hit each major muscle group at least twice a week. <strong>Major muscle groups include chest, core, arms, shoulders, back, and legs.</strong> Because of these guidelines, I have a couple of different routines I go through. Below is one of my primary weekly routines.</p>
<div id="chest">

<p>In addition to my weekly routine of weight training, all of my lifting is followed up by at least 20 minutes of <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/full-cardio-workout-done-in-only-4-minutes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cardio</a>. I’ll generally do <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/hiit-workout-plan-burn-calories-in-4-minutes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HIIT training</a> if it’s only 20-25 minutes of cardio. Anything that hits 30 minutes of cardio generally entails more steady-state cardio. I aim to get at least 2 miles on the treadmill during my cardio sessions.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you&#8217;re having a hard time building your traps, these two workouts should make your collar muscles bigger and stronger.</p>
<p>Every serious fitness buff knows that thick and strong trapezius muscles are important for strength, function, and aesthetic. So, here&#8217;s everything you need to know about the best collar muscle workouts.</p>
<h2>Top Two Traps Workout Moves for Thicker, Stronger Shoulders</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Why Are Trap Muscles Important?</h3>
<p>The secret to creating a well-proportioned upper body is to exercise each muscle group individually. For example, many shoulder exercises hit your traps, but they’re not nearly enough to build thick trapezius muscles.</p>
<p>That’s why you need to incorporate isolation exercises that work your traps specifically. Here are two of the best traps exercises for you to do:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>1. Dumbbell Shrugs</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-4577 size-full" src="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Dumbbell-Shrugs-traps-workout.jpg?resize=625%2C352&#038;ssl=1" alt="Dumbbell Shrugs | V Shred's Favorite Trap Workouts" width="625" height="352" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Dumbbell-Shrugs-traps-workout.jpg?w=625&amp;ssl=1 625w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Dumbbell-Shrugs-traps-workout.jpg?resize=300%2C169&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>Dumbbell shrugs are simple isolation exercises that solely work your trapezius muscle group. However, take note that this collar exercise with dumbbells will only be effective if you contract and squeeze your trap muscles tightly to the back, not the front.</p>
<ul>
<li>First, grab a pair of dumbbells and let them hang at your sides. Also, make sure to relax your arms. This will be your starting position.</li>
<li>Next, keeping your elbows at your sides, slide the dumbbells up by shrugging your shoulders. Contract your traps at the top and squeeze all the muscles behind your neck, then slowly let the dumbbells down to the starting position.</li>
<li>Do 4 sets of 15 reps.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> You want to pick a weight you can freely control. The most important parts of this exercise are the full stretch at the bottom and the tight squeeze at the top.</p>
<h3>2. Machine Face Pulls</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-4578 size-full" src="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Machine-Face-Pulls-traps-workout.jpg?resize=625%2C348&#038;ssl=1" alt="Machine Face Pulls | V Shred's Favorite Trap Workouts" width="625" height="348" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Machine-Face-Pulls-traps-workout.jpg?w=625&amp;ssl=1 625w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Machine-Face-Pulls-traps-workout.jpg?resize=300%2C167&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>Machine face pulls are great shoulder collar exercises for beginners that allow isolation of the traps. The idea is to stand in front of a high-pulley cable machine with a rope attached to it and to pull it using your traps.</p>
<ul>
<li>Roll the shoulders up, point your elbows out, pull the cable directly toward your nose, and squeeze all your muscles at the back of your neck.</li>
<li>Contract your muscles for one count before slowly releasing the weight back down. Remember: do not allow the cable to pull your arms along with it.</li>
<li>Do 5 sets of 20 reps.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> If lower back problems are stopping you from doing dumbbell shrugs, then machine face pulls are perfect for you. They work your traps without putting any tension on your hips, legs, or waist.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>When Should You Do Your Traps Workout Routine?</h3>
<p>Just like any muscle group, aim to work your traps at least three times a week. You may opt to perform these exercises along with your shoulder or <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/back-exercises-with-dumbbells/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">back workout routines</a>.</p>
<p>Also, make sure to <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/how-to-meal-prep-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">eat the right nutrients</a> for muscle growth. All these exercises won’t give you the traps you want if you’re not consuming the right foods for muscle growth. Ditch the junk and switch to healthier options instead. Your body will thank you for it!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The most important thing to remember when doing these traps workout moves is to create a smooth, controlled flow between contracting and stretching your muscles — do not let the weight carry you. That’s why you need to use weights you can properly control.</p>
<p>Overall, mixing <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/5-deltoid-exercises-to-strengthen-and-sculpt-your-shoulders/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shoulder, traps, and collar</a> muscle workout exercises is the best way to build a strong neck. Incorporate them into your regular workout routine to start seeing results as soon as possible.</p>

<p>When it comes to <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/one-back-exercise-superset-to-thicken-widen-your-lats/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">building an impressive back</a>, you must make sure you are performing exercises for width and thickness.

<p>It&#8217;s important to perform <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/lower-back-pain-exercises-relief/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lower back pain exercises</a> before any type of workout, and certain exercises can help reduce or eliminate back pain, which is commonly associated with an anterior tilt of the pelvis due to long periods of sitting.</p>

<p>If you think you have tried a lot of exercises for lower back pain relief but still cannot find the right remedy, then you probably are doing something wrong.</p>

]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Back workouts increase your core strength, give your body that sculpted v-shape so many fitness buffs strive for, and help give your body an overall toned look. Some of the most common back exercises include cable rows, barbell rows, and of course, pull ups.</p>
<p>However, some gym rats may not be seeing the development with their back muscles that they hoped for. This may be because of some common back training mistakes.</p>
<p>If you want to make the most out of your back workouts, then you definitely need to know the biggest back training mistake we’ve seen so you&#8217;ll know what to avoid, and which activities are a waste of your time.</p>
<h2>The Worst Mistake You Can Make When Doing Back Workouts</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>What’s the Biggest Mistake You Can Make During a Back Workout?</h3>
<p><!-- instagram error: invalid instagram resource --></p>
<p>The worst mistake anyone can make while doing back strengthening exercises is failing to target their back muscles. It may seem silly, but it’s a very common mistake we see all the time in the gym.</p>
<p>The root of the problem here is that many fitness buffs don’t know what the muscles of the back are and how to work them. In fact, many gym-goers mindlessly hop on a cable machine and start pulling with terrible form.</p>
<h3>What Are the Back Muscles?</h3>
<p>If you want to <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/10-best-back-exercises-to-build-muscle/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">build a wider back</a>, you need to know exactly what muscles are being targeted with each exercise. Back workouts must target your traps, lats, teres major and minor, rhomboids, and the upper and lower back muscles.</p>
<h3>Back Muscles and Their Workouts</h3>
<p><!-- instagram error: invalid instagram resource --></p>
<p><strong>Lower Back Muscles:</strong> The best lower back exercises <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/deadlift-proper-form/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">include deadlifts</a>, hyperextensions, Atlas stones, rack pulls, and good mornings. These lower back workouts are important for strengthening your lumbar and fixing your posture.</p>
<p><strong>Upper Back Muscles:</strong> If you’re aiming for a perfect V-shaped body, you can’t afford to skimp out on doing upper back exercises. These include chest-supported rows, wide grip rows, lat pulldowns, close-grip lat pulldowns and straight arm pulldowns.</p>
<p><strong>Lats:</strong> The lats or latissimus dorsi are the largest muscles in the back. They form a triangle from your shoulders down to your hips. Some of the best lat exercises include pull-ups, lat pulldowns, seated rows, and bent-over rows.</p>
<h3>What’s the Most Important Back Muscle?</h3>
<p>While all back muscles are important to create a well-balanced physique, the lats play, perhaps, the largest role in giving you that V-shaped body you want. Some common lat exercises include seated rows, dumbbell rows, and barbell rows. Basically, any exercise that involves rows, whether they’re machines or <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/back-exercises-with-dumbbells/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">free weights</a>, most likely targets your lats.</p>
<h3>The Most Common Back Workout Mistake</h3>
<p><!-- instagram error: invalid instagram resource --></p>
<p>Sadly, the biggest back workout mistake happens on cable row machines. The main issue is that most people who use the machine pull the cable too high. They bring their elbows up and end up targeting their traps and rear delts rather than their traps.</p>
<h3>How to Fix This Mistake?</h3>
<p>Fixing it is actually pretty simple, instead of bringing your elbows up, keep them down as you pull the cable. Also, instead of pulling the bar up to your chest, pull it toward your belly button.</p>
<p>Remember to contract your lat muscles as you’re doing the exercise.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Here&#8217;s the biggest back workout mistake you can commit:</strong></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A lot of rear delt exercises are done with the wrong form. You may see people working on their delts at the gym by creating momentum and taking tension away from the muscle (which is incorrect). Keep reading to learn how to do a proper machine and dumbbell reverse fly exercise!</p>
<h2>Rear Delt Exercises and Their Proper Form</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>What is the Rear Delt Muscle</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-3074 size-full" src="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/thrust-dumbbells-slope-rear-deltoid-3d-tricep-exercises-ss.jpg?resize=625%2C298&#038;ssl=1" alt="What is the Rear Delt Muscle | Killer Rear Delt Exercises (Fix Your Form!) | Deltoid workout" width="625" height="298" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/thrust-dumbbells-slope-rear-deltoid-3d-tricep-exercises-ss.jpg?w=625&amp;ssl=1 625w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/thrust-dumbbells-slope-rear-deltoid-3d-tricep-exercises-ss.jpg?resize=300%2C143&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>To effectively target your rear deltoid muscle, you need to know where it is. It’s the muscle on the back of your shoulder, that runs along the scapula and inserts into the humerus, or upper arm bone.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #000080;">1. Single-Arm Cable Reverse Fly</span></h3>
<p><iframe class="giphy-embed" src="https://giphy.com/embed/oFMurfrzWnW7DjPVIW" width="480" height="270" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/oFMurfrzWnW7DjPVIW">via GIPHY</a></p>
<p>The unilateral cable reverse fly will teach you how to evenly stimulate the rear delt muscles as you&#8217;re working out each shoulder. This exercise targets a single arm at a time, which is perfect for people whose <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/bicep-workout-bigger-arms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">arms aren’t evenly strong</a> or built. It’ll help stimulate one rear deltoid to catch up with the other.</p>
<p><strong>How to:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Grab the cable with your arm stretched out across your chest.</li>
<li>Bring out the cable while keeping your arm straight and shoulders rolled forward.</li>
<li>Stop when your arm is parallel to the body.</li>
<li>Then bring the cable back across the chest.</li>
<li>Do 4 sets of 12 reps for each arm.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Tip: </strong>Avoid shrugging the shoulders to keep the focus on the rear delts rather than the traps.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #000080;">2. Reverse Machine Fly</span></h3>
<p><iframe class="giphy-embed" src="https://giphy.com/embed/8hYOMlm3RDsTze54TV" width="480" height="270" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/8hYOMlm3RDsTze54TV">via GIPHY</a></p>
<p>This second reverse fly exercise will help you to consistently stimulate both rear deltoid muscles at the same time. The machine requires both arms to move at the same time, which helps workout both arms simultaneously with the same amount of weight.</p>
<p><strong>How to:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Roll your shoulders forward when grabbing the weight in front of you.</li>
<li>Then bring out the bars to the side until they’re parallel to the shoulders.</li>
<li>Bring them back together but don&#8217;t let them rest.</li>
<li>Do 4 sets of 12 reps.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Tip: </strong>Always keep your shoulders rolled forward to really keep the tension on the rear deltoids.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #000080;">3. Chest-Supported Dumbbell Reverse Fly</span></h3>
<p><iframe class="giphy-embed" src="https://giphy.com/embed/BNaWxw1mXMQtdv8Jkr" width="480" height="270" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/BNaWxw1mXMQtdv8Jkr">via GIPHY</a></p>
<p>A chest-supported dumbbell reverse fly will stimulate both rear delts muscles without creating momentum with your legs. This is great for anybody looking to get strict with their form. Which is necessary to build muscle!</p>
<p><strong>How to:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Lie down on the bench on your chest with a dumbbell in each hand.</li>
<li>Then roll your shoulders forward and lift the dumbbells to the side almost to parallel to the shoulders.</li>
<li>Bring it back down until they’re a foot apart to avoid a cheated rest.</li>
<li>Do 4 sets of 12 reps.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Tip: </strong>Don’t let your arms hang straight down to keep the tension on your deltoid muscles.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #000080;">4. Bent Over Reverse Dumbbell Fly</span></h3>
<p><iframe class="giphy-embed" src="https://giphy.com/embed/1isg0ew2ApJVuaiTJa" width="480" height="270" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/1isg0ew2ApJVuaiTJa">via GIPHY</a></p>
<p>This reverse dumbbell fly will use all of the stimulation techniques from the other reverse fly exercises.</p>
<p><strong>How to:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Sit down on a bench with a dumbbell in each hand.</li>
<li>Bend over until your chest is just above your knees and roll your shoulders forward.</li>
<li>Push the weight outwards and stop when your arms are parallel with your body.</li>
<li>Bring it back down with the dumbbells just a foot apart.</li>
<li>Do 4 sets of 12 reps.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Tip: </strong>Always roll your shoulders forward throughout the whole movement. Avoid creating momentum with your legs and don’t push out too far because you’ll lose tension in the muscles.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Back exercises with dumbbells help strengthen and tone the upper and lower lats and lower back muscles. These dumbbell workouts will help your back stay in top condition.</p>
<p>Here are seven back exercises you can start with.</p>
<h2>Back Exercises With Dumbbells | Get Buff in No Time</h2>
<h3><span style="color: #000080;">1. Deadlift</span></h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-1788 size-full" src="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/person-holding-black-dumbbells-back-exercises-with-dumbbells-px.jpg?resize=625%2C417&#038;ssl=1" alt="Deadlift | Try These Back Exercises With Dumbbells To Build Those Back Muscles | lower back workout" width="625" height="417" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/person-holding-black-dumbbells-back-exercises-with-dumbbells-px.jpg?w=625&amp;ssl=1 625w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/person-holding-black-dumbbells-back-exercises-with-dumbbells-px.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px" data-recalc-dims="1" /><br />
The dumbbell deadlift is arguably the most effective back exercise for every gym-goer today. Hold on to a dumbbell with each hand and stand straight.</p>
<p>Lean forward, then bend your knees and hips to lower the dumbbells down to your ankles and return to initial position after a short pause. Please note that this workout may be dangerous if done wrong as it can damage your spine, so maintaining proper form is vital.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #000080;">2. Bent-Over Row</span></h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-2771 size-full" src="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/bent-over-two-dumbbell-back-exercises-with-dumbbells-ss.jpg?resize=625%2C417&#038;ssl=1" alt="Bent-Over Row | Try These Back Exercises With Dumbbells To Build Those Back Muscles | lower back dumbbell exercises" width="625" height="417" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/bent-over-two-dumbbell-back-exercises-with-dumbbells-ss.jpg?w=625&amp;ssl=1 625w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/bent-over-two-dumbbell-back-exercises-with-dumbbells-ss.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>Hold two dumbbells while standing up and start to reach down by slightly bending your knees. Lift the dumbbells up while keeping the elbows close to the body, then return to the initial position after a short pause.</p>
<p>Do your best to keep your back straight while doing this. To really maximize the movement, make sure you squeeze the back muscles as you reach the peak before you release.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #000080;">3. Bent-Over Reverse Fly</span></h3>
<p><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/bent-over-reverse-fly-2kOdq9IqjU33qRHx7v"><img src="https://i0.wp.com/media.giphy.com/media/2kOdq9IqjU33qRHx7v/giphy.gif?resize=480%2C270&#038;ssl=1" alt="Bent-Over Reverse Fly GIF - Find &amp; Share on GIPHY" width="480" height="270" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><br />
Start in a standing position with your feet shoulder-width apart. Bend over with your arms hanging in front of you.</p>
<p>You can also do this with your elbows bent. Lift your arms sidewards at an angle of about 90 degrees to the body.</p>
<p>Squeeze your shoulder blades together at the top briefly and slowly bring the weights down in front of you.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #000080;">4. Kneeling One-Arm Row</span></h3>
<p><!-- instagram error: invalid instagram resource --></p>
<p>You need a bench to keep your knee and hand on as you do this workout. This workout depends on which side you&#8217;re going to start off with.</p>
<p>Assuming you start lifting using your left hand, keep your left leg straight and planted to the ground, with your right hand and leg securely on the bench. Maintain a neutral position with your spine then start pulling the dumbbell towards your rib cage.</p>
<p>Refrain from moving and twisting your torso as you do this exercise. Lower the dumbbell back down and pause briefly.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #000080;">5.</span><span style="color: #000080;">Dumbbell Lateral Pullover</span></h3>
<p><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/dumbbell-lateral-pullover-iOscWKqmkZaZHGoyzV"><img src="https://i0.wp.com/media.giphy.com/media/iOscWKqmkZaZHGoyzV/giphy.gif?resize=480%2C270&#038;ssl=1" alt="Dumbbell Lateral Pullover GIF - Find &amp; Share on GIPHY" width="480" height="270" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>The Dumbbell Lat Pullover is an effective workout for more than just your back, when done properly it also strengthens the arms, core, chest, and shoulders too.</p>
<p>Lie on a bench, weights lifted overhead. Bend the elbows back until your arms are in line with your body, Keep your core engaged and your spine aligned, do not overextend the back.</p>

<p>Grab two dumbbells and get into position with your feet shoulder-width apart. Twist to the right side and reach down to the right foot while keeping your back straight and knees slightly bent.</p>
<p>Get back to an upright position and do the same to the other side. Keep in mind to not rush through this exercise. Focus on slowly achieving the full range of motion to hit the right muscles and not injure yourself.</p>

<div class="embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9 mb-5">

</div>
<p class="p1">Remember, a single workout will only get you so far when trying to get in shape. You need to make sure you’re following an all around plan that matches your body type.. And then the results will come much faster! <a href="https://vshred.com/sp/survey/survey-aka1?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=post&amp;utm_campaign=v-shred&amp;utm_content=10-best-back-exercises-to-build-muscle&amp;utm_term=4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Click here to use our free body type quiz and learn exactly what to do to get in shape fast!</a></p>
<p class="p1">Building a back that you’re proud of can be difficult. But it becomes much easier when you’re doing exercises that will actually work it properly.</p>
<p class="p1">Here are 10 of the best back exercises for building muscle and strength!</p>
<h2 class="p1">The Best Back Exercises</h2>
<h3 class="p1">Rack Pulls</h3>
<p class="p1">These are one of the best exercises there are for building mass. Due to the short range of motion, you are able to go much heavier than you could on a regular deadlift. Also, this will focus more heavily on your back than your legs as well.</p>
<p class="p1">You want to set the bar up at about knee height. From there you will step up to the bar, with it touching your knees. Sit back on your heels, retract your scapula and drive your hips forward as you slide the bar across your thighs. From there, you can either drop the weight or return it back down slowly.</p>
<h3 class="p1">Barbell Rows</h3>
<p class="p1">This is one of the best compound back exercises there are due to it hitting so many different muscles, while focusing on your back the most. For these, you will pick the bar up, sit back on your heels, and bend over as you lower the bar in front of you away from your body. Then you will take your elbows and drive them back and out at a 45 degree angle and control it on the way back down.</p>
<h3 class="p1">Deadlifts</h3>
<p class="p1">Commonly referred to as the best compound exercise ever, these have an outstanding effect on the back muscles as well. Starting with the bar on the ground.. You will step up to the bar with your feet shoulder width and shins nearly touching the bar. Then you will grab the bar just outside of your shins and roll your shoulders back and press them down.. This will help pull the “slack” out of the bar. Then you will lift the bar up, sliding it<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>up your legs and once the bar is above your knees, drive your hips forward and stand straight up. Also, don’t forget to lock out your glutes at the top.</p>
<h3 class="p1">Weighted Pull-ups</h3>
<p class="p1">These are a great advanced variation to a regular pull-up. Starting with your hands outside of shoulder width, you will grab the pull up bar and hang. From there, without kicking, start to pull yourself up and act like you’re pulling your elbows in towards your side. Once at the top, return yourself back down in a controlled manner.</p>
<h3 class="p1">Weighted Chin-ups</h3>
<p class="p1">Very similar to weighted pull-ups but you will start with your palms facing you and hands much closer. From there you will pull yourself up, without kicking, and drive your elbows down and back until your chin is at the bar. Then return yourself back down in a controlled manner as well.</p>
<h3 class="p1">Straight Arm Pushdowns</h3>
<p class="p1">A great exercise for the “sweep” of the lats. You will use a cable attachment of your choice and put it to the top. From there you will grab it and feel a stretch in your lats at the top. Then, with a soft bend in your elbows, drive your arms down and back until the attachment is near your belly button. Then return back to the top and the stretch in your lats again.</p>
<h3 class="p1">Dumbbell Rows</h3>
<p class="p1">One of the best dumbbell back exercises. You will take a dumbbell in one hand with the other hand supporting your body. Then you will, first, bring the dumbbell backward and then row the weight up. This will help you feel it in your lat more. Then return back down the same way. Don’t forget to do both arms.</p>
<h3 class="p1">Cable Rows</h3>
<p class="p1">These are a staple in most back workouts and for good reason. For these, you can use any attachment you like. You just want to get your body in a strong position with your knees slightly bent and your back slightly leaning back. Then you will, again, drive your arms down and back towards your belly button. Then return the same way. Try to feel a stretch at the bottom of the exercise as well.</p>
<h3 class="p1">Lat Pulldowns</h3>
<p class="p1">These are a great exercise no matter your goal. You will get in a lat pulldown machine and grab the bar just outside of shoulder width. From there, you will take your elbows and drive them down and into your sides, feeling a squeeze on your lats. Then control it on the way back up and feel the stretch at the top.</p>
<h3 class="p1">Close Grip Lat Pulldowns</h3>
<p class="p1">Very similar to regular lat pulldowns but you will use an attachment that allows for a close grip. From there, you want to aim to feel a stretch at the top. Then drive your elbows down in front of you and squeeze them back. And return the weight back in a controlled manner.</p>
<p class="p1">You can pick from these exercises the next time you’re going to do a back workout. Aim for 4 of these for 4 sets each and you will have a great back workout!</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">If you’re looking for the best upper body workouts, this one will keep you coming back for more!</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='1170' height='659' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/4YVT_SveWo4?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></p>
<p class="p1">But in order to build lean muscle, you need to know what body type you are. <a href="https://vshred.com/sp/survey/survey-aka1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Take this free body type quiz that tells you exactly what to do to get in shape fast!</a></p>
<p class="p1">Truth is, there are tons of upper body workouts scattering the internet. So how are you supposed to know which ones will actually work?</p>
<p class="p1">Whether an upper body workout is effective or not will come down to three things:</p>
<ol>
<li class="p1">Does it hit all the different muscle groups in your upper body?</li>
<li class="p1">Do you have proper form?</li>
<li class="p1">Is it an easy workout to do?</li>
</ol>
<p class="p1">Meaning, you need to hit your back, chest, shoulders, biceps and triceps all in one. You need to do all the exercises correctly. And you need to be able to do the workout without spending hours and hours in the gym.</p>
<p class="p1">That’s why this is better than the other upper body workouts that you’ve tried. It does all three and more!</p>
<p class="p1">This upper body workout will be three supersets (two exercises performed back to back), targeting all the different muscles groups. And it will only consist of resistance band exercises. Which makes it possible to do at home or even while traveling!</p>
<h2 class="p1">The Upper Body Workouts Layout</h2>
<ul>
<li class="p1">3 supersets</li>
<li class="p1">4 sets</li>
<li class="p1">10-12 reps per set</li>
<li class="p1">1 minute of rest between each set</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="p1">The Exercises:</h3>
<h4 class="p1">Low Banded Row Superset &amp; Banded Bicep Curls</h4>
<p class="p1">Start off by sitting on the ground with your feet straight out in front of you. From there, you will hook the band in the arch of your foot. Then grab the band near your feet and sit back into a 90 degree position with your arms straight out in front of you. You will then focus on driving your elbows back in-line with your belly button and return back to starting position. Repeat for 10-12 reps and go straight into your curls.</p>
<p class="p1">After that, you will get up and stand on the band. Grabbing the handles you will place your feet width depending on how difficult you want the curl to be. Then, keeping your elbows in the same position throughout, curl the weight all the weight up, and return back down slowly. Repeat for 10-12 reps and then rest for a minute. Then do 3 more sets.</p>
<h4 class="p1">Banded Pushup Superset &amp; Overhead Tricep Extensions</h4>
<p class="p1">Here, you will wrap the band around your back and grab it wherever is best fit for your capabilities. After picking your arm width, you will get into push-up position with your hands pressing down on top of the bands. Keeping the band wrapped around your lower shoulders, go down and do a regular pushup. Keep your shoulders rolled back and focus on driving your elbows together to engage your chest. Repeat for 10-12 reps and go straight into tricep extensions.</p>
<p class="p1">For the tricep extensions, you will sit on the band and lift it up over your head. Grab it wherever is best fit for your capabilities and elevate your elbows. From there, keeping your elbows in the same spot, drive your hands up, squeezing your triceps. Once your arms are straight, lower your hands until you are just past a 90 degree angle and go into the next rep. Repeat for 10-12 reps and rest for a minute. Then do 3 more sets and move into the final superset.</p>
<h4 class="p1">Shoulder Press Superset &amp; Lateral Raises</h4>
<p class="p1">For this exercise, you will start standing with the band under your feet. You will want to keep your feet together so that the exercise is not too difficult to perform properly. From there, you want to slightly bring your elbows forward, then push the handles up and together at the top. Then lower your arms until your elbows are just past 90 degrees and go into your next rep. Repeat for 10-12 reps and go straight into lateral raises.</p>
<p class="p1">For this exercise you will continue to stand on the resistance band. But instead of pressing the handles up, we are going to start with our arms down by our side and press the handles outward. By focusing on pressing outward, rather than raising up, you will engage less of your trap muscle to help with better isolation of the delt. Raise until your hands are shoulders level and return your arms back down to your side. Repeat for 10-12 reps, do 3 more sets and you’re done with the workout!</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A back and bicep workout for mass isn’t just about heavy lifting and endurance. When doing any type of back and bicep exercise, the most important aspect you need to be mindful of is the correct form. Proper form is what makes your back and bicep workout for beginners integral to achieving your fitness goals. Find out which exercises you need to add to your workout and how to properly execute them!</p>
<h2>Back and Bicep Workout Exercises and Proper Form</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Back Workout Exercises</strong></span></h3>
<h3><span style="color: #000080;">1. Pull-ups</span></h3>
<p><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/9xcCsQwMW5vrbY0yV2"><img src="https://i1.wp.com/media.giphy.com/media/9xcCsQwMW5vrbY0yV2/giphy.gif?resize=480%2C270&#038;ssl=1" alt="Animated GIF - Find &amp; Share on GIPHY" width="480" height="270" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>Pull-ups are one of the best back exercises, and it’s a great way to warm up all of the muscles on your back. To do this correctly, make sure to lead with your shoulders and squeeze your elbows into your side. Avoid swinging and kicking your legs to keep the focus on your back muscles. Do 3 sets of 10 reps.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #000080;">2. Bent-Over Barbell Rows</span></h3>
<p><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/82nGufnqg96hYzPzkc"><img src="https://i0.wp.com/media.giphy.com/media/82nGufnqg96hYzPzkc/giphy.gif?resize=480%2C270&#038;ssl=1" alt="Animated GIF - Find &amp; Share on GIPHY" width="480" height="270" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>Bent-over barbell rows are popular in a lot of back workout routines, especially for bulking up. This compound exercise works multiple muscles on your back simultaneously. Do 4 sets, decreasing your reps with each set.</p>
<h3>3. Straight Arm Lat Pulldown</h3>
<p><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/PO8h1h4BOgdl7q5Qak"><img src="https://i0.wp.com/media.giphy.com/media/PO8h1h4BOgdl7q5Qak/giphy.gif?resize=480%2C270&#038;ssl=1" alt="Animated GIF - Find &amp; Share on GIPHY" width="480" height="270" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>This exercise is great for your lat muscles. Try to keep weight at a minimum to keep the focus on the lat muscle instead of the triceps. Make sure to keep elbows slight bent and keep your chest out. Do 4 sets with decreasing reps with each set.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #000080;">4. Seated Cable Row Neutral Grip</span></h3>
<p><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/KyGGBFUu7OUwKjAla8"><img src="https://i2.wp.com/media.giphy.com/media/KyGGBFUu7OUwKjAla8/giphy.gif?resize=480%2C270&#038;ssl=1" alt="Animated GIF - Find &amp; Share on GIPHY" width="480" height="270" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>For this back exercise, make sure to keep your chest pushed out while pulling back on the cable. Pull back with your elbows by your side instead of flaring them up and out. Do 4 sets of 10-12 reps.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #000080;">Mid-Workout Supplements</span></h3>
<p><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/zrdVOmq13KvkdDTxmB"><img src="https://i1.wp.com/media.giphy.com/media/zrdVOmq13KvkdDTxmB/giphy.gif?resize=480%2C270&#038;ssl=1" alt="Animated GIF - Find &amp; Share on GIPHY" width="480" height="270" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>One tip you may not hear often is a mid-workout supplement. Halfway through your back and bicep workout, take some BCAA. These are building blocks of protein and will instantly help with muscle recovery, fuel your energy, and hydrate you with a boost of electrolytes. For BCAA supplements, we recommend <a href="http://vshred.fit/BlueStarBCAA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Aminofast Blue Star BCAA,</a> which is easy to digest and keeps you going for the rest of your workout.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong><span style="color: #000080;">Bicep Workout Exercises</span></strong></h3>
<h3><span style="color: #000080;">1. Preacher Curls</span></h3>
<p><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/3s6GUItP1Cz0Z21guB"><img src="https://i1.wp.com/media.giphy.com/media/3s6GUItP1Cz0Z21guB/giphy.gif?resize=480%2C270&#038;ssl=1" alt="Animated GIF - Find &amp; Share on GIPHY" width="480" height="270" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>Preacher curls are a great exercise for <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/5-bicep-exercises-for-bigger-arms-10-minute-bicep-workout/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">working out both heads of the bicep</a>, but it does put more emphasis on the short head of the biceps and improve the thickness of your biceps. Remember to squeeze your biceps when you’ve pulled the bar to the top. Do 4 sets of 10-12 reps.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #000080;">2. Alternating Dumbbell Curls</span></h3>
<p><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/lznwP2pcGiM93CUOq5"><img src="https://i1.wp.com/media.giphy.com/media/lznwP2pcGiM93CUOq5/giphy.gif?resize=480%2C270&#038;ssl=1" alt="Animated GIF - Find &amp; Share on GIPHY" width="480" height="270" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>Alternating dumbbell curl is a <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/best-arm-workouts-with-dumbbells-for-bigger-arms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">great arm exercise</a> which also targets both heads of the bicep. With this exercise, don’t lift dumbbells beyond your capacity. You will have a harder time maintaining proper form. Do 4 sets of 10 reps for this exercise.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>For a demonstration on the proper form of each of the exercises in this back and bicep workout, watch this video from our YouTube channel V Shred!</strong></p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='1170' height='659' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/Nq4G4zuqQOc?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></p>
<p>Your biceps are the secondary movers in your back exercises, which makes it easy to target both back muscles and biceps for this workout. In every workout, you need to be mindful of the <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/types-muscles-bulk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">muscle groups</a> you’re targeting to achieve your muscle mass goals.

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This low back pain exercise routine is a <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/lower-back-pain-exercises-relief/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">great back pain exercise</a>: it can help relieve pain and boost your performance during your workout. Low back pain is usually caused by muscle imbalances, like tight quad muscles, a weakened diaphragm or underdeveloped glute muscles.</p>
<p>You can do these quick lower back exercises at the gym or at home to warm up your hamstrings and roll out your quads. Check out our lower back pain workout plan below:</p>
<h2>Low Back Pain Exercise Routine to Do Anywhere</h2>
<h3><strong><span style="color: #000080;">Tips to Remember Before Starting</span></strong></h3>
<h3><span style="color: #000080;">Weakened Diaphragm</span></h3>
<p>Your diaphragm is a horizontal muscle in your body at the bottom of your rib cage. It is responsible for filling your lungs with air and allowing you to breathe. It helps your rib cage expand and compress the lungs.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #000080;">Diaphragmatic Breathing</span></h3>
<p>You need to inhale deep into your belly instead of your chest. Breathing from your chest causes shortness in breath and bad posture because you&#8217;re not inhaling and exhaling deeply and completely.</p>
<p>Breathe in through your nose and fill your belly with air instead of your chest. Focus on bringing the air down. Breathe out through your mouth and make sure to let out every last bit of air.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #000080;">Foam Roll Your Quads</span></h3>
<p>Foam-roll your quads to loosen them up. Make sure to target all four muscles in your quads. Roll them out nice and deep to <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/muscles-cramping/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">loosen up the tight muscles</a> and release some stress in the pelvis.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #000080;">Pre-Stimulate Glute Muscles</span></h3>
<p>Pre-stimulating your glute muscles will strengthen them and allow you to stimulate them more easily when doing exercises such as squats. This will also help your glute muscles become more dominant than your quads.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong><span style="color: #000080;">Low Back Pain Exercise Routine</span></strong></h3>
<h3><span style="color: #000080;">1. Child Pose</span></h3>
<div id="attachment_2248" style="width: 635px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2248" class="wp-image-2248 size-full" src="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/child-pose-low-back-pain-exercise.jpg?resize=625%2C347&#038;ssl=1" alt="Child Pose | Low Back Pain Exercise: Best Exercises For Low Back Pain | single best exercise for back pain" width="625" height="347" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/child-pose-low-back-pain-exercise.jpg?w=625&amp;ssl=1 625w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/child-pose-low-back-pain-exercise.jpg?resize=300%2C167&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px" data-recalc-dims="1" /><p id="caption-attachment-2248" class="wp-caption-text">Image CHILD POSE by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raSV4DR3QFc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">V Shred</a></p></div>
<p>Touch your hands to the ground, fingers spread out. Externally rotate your shoulders and then drop back to your feet into a child pose. Take your fingers as far away from your feet as possible.</p>
<p>Breathe in through your nose, and breathe out through your mouth. You&#8217;ll feel a contraction around your abs, which will loosen up your lower back muscles. Do 5 sets of 5 breaths each.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #000080;">2. Tabletop Position</span></h3>
<p><img src="https://i1.wp.com/j.gifs.com/gLOBq3.gif?w=1170&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>From the child pose, come into a tabletop position and do cat-cows with diaphragmatic breathing. Make sure your hands are directly below your shoulders and your knees are directly below your hips, both shoulder-width apart.</p>
<p>Externally rotate shoulders and keep back in a neutral position, tucking your belly button in. When you inhale, bring your stomach up, and when you exhale, bring it back down. Do 5 breaths.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #000080;">3. Bring Your Elbow Outwards</span></h3>
<p><img src="https://i2.wp.com/j.gifs.com/86nwnL.gif?w=1170&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>Stay in the previous neutral position. Bring your hand up to your head, elbow down, then inhale. When you exhale through your mouth, turn your body to the side, bringing your elbow upward as much as you can. Make sure your hips stay neutral throughout the exercise.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #000080;">4. Hip Thrusts</span></h3>
<p><img src="https://i0.wp.com/j.gifs.com/nr0MqR.gif?w=1170&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>Lie down on your back with your knees bent and slightly apart. Then, keeping your heels on the ground, thrust your hips up into the air.</p>
<p>Contract your glute muscles while your hips are raised up, and then slowly bring them back down to the ground. Do 10 reps of this exercise.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #000080;">5. Single-Leg Glute Bridge</span></h3>
<p><img src="https://i0.wp.com/j.gifs.com/PZk2ow.gif?w=1170&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>Stay in the same position but keep one leg raised while thrusting your hips upward. Make sure to continue to squeeze the glute muscle connected to the foot planted on the ground. Do 10 reps for each leg.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #000080;">6. Fire Hydrants</span></h3>
<p><img src="https://i2.wp.com/j.gifs.com/Oyj1xN.gif?w=1170&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>From the single-leg glute bridge, flip over into a tabletop position and do fire hydrants. With your knee bent at a 90-degree angle, bring it out to the side to contract the glute muscle. You can also do this exercise at the gym using an abductor machine.</p>
