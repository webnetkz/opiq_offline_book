								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When I’m specifically trying to gain strength or size through my entire body, I rotate through this 5-day workout routine.</p>
<p>In this article:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="#chest">Day 1: Chest</a></li>
<li><a href="#back">Day 2: Back</a></li>
<li><a href="#legs">Day 3: Legs</a></li>
<li><a href="#arms">Day 4: Arms</a></li>
<li><a href="#shoulders">Day 5: Shoulders</a></li>
</ol>
<h2>5 Day Weekly Workout Routine</h2>
<p>When I prescribe workouts for my clients, I always make sure I’ve done each and every one of the exercises as well as the routine itself to make sure it works the muscles I want to be working, to make sure it’s set at the proper difficulty, and to make sure I’ve done a run through for when questions arise. I do change up my workout routines from time to time, but in general, my <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/weight-training-beginners/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">weight training</a> stays relatively consistent.</p>
<p>Based on the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) guidelines for resistance training, if you’re trying to gain strength or size, it’s ideal to hit each major muscle group at least twice a week. <strong>Major muscle groups include chest, core, arms, shoulders, back, and legs.</strong> Because of these guidelines, I have a couple of different routines I go through. Below is one of my primary weekly routines.</p>
<div id="chest">

<p>In addition to my weekly routine of weight training, all of my lifting is followed up by at least 20 minutes of <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/full-cardio-workout-done-in-only-4-minutes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cardio</a>. I’ll generally do <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/hiit-workout-plan-burn-calories-in-4-minutes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HIIT training</a> if it’s only 20-25 minutes of cardio. Anything that hits 30 minutes of cardio generally entails more steady-state cardio. I aim to get at least 2 miles on the treadmill during my cardio sessions.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you&#8217;re having a hard time building your traps, these two workouts should make your collar muscles bigger and stronger.</p>
<p>Every serious fitness buff knows that thick and strong trapezius muscles are important for strength, function, and aesthetic. So, here&#8217;s everything you need to know about the best collar muscle workouts.</p>
<h2>Top Two Traps Workout Moves for Thicker, Stronger Shoulders</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Why Are Trap Muscles Important?</h3>
<p>The secret to creating a well-proportioned upper body is to exercise each muscle group individually. For example, many shoulder exercises hit your traps, but they’re not nearly enough to build thick trapezius muscles.</p>
<p>That’s why you need to incorporate isolation exercises that work your traps specifically. Here are two of the best traps exercises for you to do:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>1. Dumbbell Shrugs</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-4577 size-full" src="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Dumbbell-Shrugs-traps-workout.jpg?resize=625%2C352&#038;ssl=1" alt="Dumbbell Shrugs | V Shred's Favorite Trap Workouts" width="625" height="352" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Dumbbell-Shrugs-traps-workout.jpg?w=625&amp;ssl=1 625w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Dumbbell-Shrugs-traps-workout.jpg?resize=300%2C169&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>Dumbbell shrugs are simple isolation exercises that solely work your trapezius muscle group. However, take note that this collar exercise with dumbbells will only be effective if you contract and squeeze your trap muscles tightly to the back, not the front.</p>
<ul>
<li>First, grab a pair of dumbbells and let them hang at your sides. Also, make sure to relax your arms. This will be your starting position.</li>
<li>Next, keeping your elbows at your sides, slide the dumbbells up by shrugging your shoulders. Contract your traps at the top and squeeze all the muscles behind your neck, then slowly let the dumbbells down to the starting position.</li>
<li>Do 4 sets of 15 reps.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> You want to pick a weight you can freely control. The most important parts of this exercise are the full stretch at the bottom and the tight squeeze at the top.</p>
<h3>2. Machine Face Pulls</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-4578 size-full" src="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Machine-Face-Pulls-traps-workout.jpg?resize=625%2C348&#038;ssl=1" alt="Machine Face Pulls | V Shred's Favorite Trap Workouts" width="625" height="348" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Machine-Face-Pulls-traps-workout.jpg?w=625&amp;ssl=1 625w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Machine-Face-Pulls-traps-workout.jpg?resize=300%2C167&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>Machine face pulls are great shoulder collar exercises for beginners that allow isolation of the traps. The idea is to stand in front of a high-pulley cable machine with a rope attached to it and to pull it using your traps.</p>
<ul>
<li>Roll the shoulders up, point your elbows out, pull the cable directly toward your nose, and squeeze all your muscles at the back of your neck.</li>
<li>Contract your muscles for one count before slowly releasing the weight back down. Remember: do not allow the cable to pull your arms along with it.</li>
<li>Do 5 sets of 20 reps.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> If lower back problems are stopping you from doing dumbbell shrugs, then machine face pulls are perfect for you. They work your traps without putting any tension on your hips, legs, or waist.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>When Should You Do Your Traps Workout Routine?</h3>
<p>Just like any muscle group, aim to work your traps at least three times a week. You may opt to perform these exercises along with your shoulder or <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/back-exercises-with-dumbbells/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">back workout routines</a>.</p>
<p>Also, make sure to <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/how-to-meal-prep-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">eat the right nutrients</a> for muscle growth. All these exercises won’t give you the traps you want if you’re not consuming the right foods for muscle growth. Ditch the junk and switch to healthier options instead. Your body will thank you for it!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The most important thing to remember when doing these traps workout moves is to create a smooth, controlled flow between contracting and stretching your muscles — do not let the weight carry you. That’s why you need to use weights you can properly control.</p>
<p>Overall, mixing <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/5-deltoid-exercises-to-strengthen-and-sculpt-your-shoulders/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shoulder, traps, and collar</a> muscle workout exercises is the best way to build a strong neck. Incorporate them into your regular workout routine to start seeing results as soon as possible.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">If you’re looking to build your shoulders, you need to be doing the right deltoid exercises. Start doing some of these to skyrocket your results!</p>
<div class="embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9 mb-5">
<!-- iframe plugin v.4.4 wordpress.org/plugins/iframe/ -->
<iframe src="//youtube.com/embed/1_9hROfusVU" class="embed-responsive-item box-shadow-wide" width="100%" height="500" scrolling="yes" frameborder="0"></iframe>
</div>
<p class="p2">But these deltoid exercises are completely pointless without knowing your body type first! Once you know your body type, you speed up results with everything that you do in the gym or the kitchen.<a href="https://vshred.com/sp/survey/survey-aka1" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> If you want to find out which body type you are, take our free body type quiz before you do anything else!</a></p>
<p class="p2">Building your shoulders to become sculpted like you wish starts with doing exercises for the right part of the shoulder.</p>
<p class="p1">There are actually 3 main areas when talking about the “shoulder muscle”.</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">Front Delts</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">These are responsible for helping to create that “3D” appearance from the front. Also, these help to create a nice separation between your shoulder and your chest muscle.</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">Side Delts</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">There are responsible for giving your shoulders a wider appearance due to them being out “outer” head. These are the king of making your shoulders look better!</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">Rear Delts</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">These are responsible for not only helping posture by pulling your shoulders back. But these are also great for giving an even appearance to your shoulder muscles from behind or the side.</p>
<p class="p1">But today, we are focusing on the side deltoid exercises because we are going for wider shoulders!</p>
<h2 class="p1">5 Deltoid Exercises For Wider Shoulders</h2>
<h3 class="p1">Dumbbell Lateral Raises</h3>
<p class="p1">These are the most common of the deltoid exercises, but for good reason! Here, you will start by grabbing a light weight set of dumbbells. From there, you will stand straight up, take your arms and open them out to the side. Focusing on lifting your elbows slightly higher than your hands, you will raise your arms until they are level with your shoulders. Then you will lower them back down to your side.</p>
<h3 class="p1">45 Degree Raises</h3>
<p class="p1">These are similar to the lateral raises. But instead of raising your arms out to the side, you are going to lift them out and forward at a 45 degree angle. This is going to allow you to use slightly heavier weights and target your outer head really well with that additional weight. Remember to lead with your elbows so you don’t accidentally cheat with another muscle group.</p>
<h3 class="p1">Leaning Cable Lateral Raises</h3>
<p class="p1">Again, similar to the dumbbell lateral raises because most deltoid exercises are going to have something to do with raising weight laterally. But you will put the cable pulley to the bottom, grab the bar and lean out to the side. You want to have your body at an angle to the pulley. From there, you will push your arm down and out away from you, rather than raising it straight up. By pushing it out and away from you, you will engage more deltoid, rather than traps. Once you have raised your arm to just below parallel to the ground, you will lower your arm back down to perpendicular to the ground. NOT ALL THE WAY! This will allow constant tension on the muscle.</p>
<h3 class="p1">Side Lying Lateral Raises</h3>
<p class="p1">With an opposite lean of the cable raises, you will be on an incline bench. From there, you will, again, drive your arm down and out as you raise the weight up to the side. Once you have your arm in-line with your shoulders, lower it back down to your side. But do not rest it on your body. Remember to maintain tension as much as possible throughout.</p>
<h3 class="p1">EZ Bar Upright Rows</h3>
<p class="p1">Lastly, we have another common choice for deltoid exercises, but for great reason again. Here you will want to start out by grabbing an EZ bar. Grab it by the outer handles or whatever is most comfortable for you. Then take your elbows, and at a slight angle forward, drive them out as you raise the weight up. Once your elbows are level with your shoulders, lower the weight back down to starting position.</p>
<p class="p1">So there are 5 great deltoid exercises for sculpting your shoulders fast! If you like these exercises, make sure you share this with a friend so they can learn about these too!</p>
<p class="p1">Also, let us know down below what your favorite deltoid exercises are!</p>
