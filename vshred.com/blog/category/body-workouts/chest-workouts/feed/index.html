								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When I’m specifically trying to gain strength or size through my entire body, I rotate through this 5-day workout routine.</p>
<p>In this article:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="#chest">Day 1: Chest</a></li>
<li><a href="#back">Day 2: Back</a></li>
<li><a href="#legs">Day 3: Legs</a></li>
<li><a href="#arms">Day 4: Arms</a></li>
<li><a href="#shoulders">Day 5: Shoulders</a></li>
</ol>
<h2>5 Day Weekly Workout Routine</h2>
<p>When I prescribe workouts for my clients, I always make sure I’ve done each and every one of the exercises as well as the routine itself to make sure it works the muscles I want to be working, to make sure it’s set at the proper difficulty, and to make sure I’ve done a run through for when questions arise. I do change up my workout routines from time to time, but in general, my <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/weight-training-beginners/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">weight training</a> stays relatively consistent.</p>
<p>Based on the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) guidelines for resistance training, if you’re trying to gain strength or size, it’s ideal to hit each major muscle group at least twice a week. <strong>Major muscle groups include chest, core, arms, shoulders, back, and legs.</strong> Because of these guidelines, I have a couple of different routines I go through. Below is one of my primary weekly routines.</p>

<p>In addition to my weekly routine of weight training, all of my lifting is followed up by at least 20 minutes of <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/full-cardio-workout-done-in-only-4-minutes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cardio</a>. I’ll generally do <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/hiit-workout-plan-burn-calories-in-4-minutes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HIIT training</a> if it’s only 20-25 minutes of cardio. Anything that hits 30 minutes of cardio generally entails more steady-state cardio. I aim to get at least 2 miles on the treadmill during my cardio sessions.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">If you’re looking for the best upper body workouts, this one will keep you coming back for more!</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='1170' height='659' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/4YVT_SveWo4?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></p>
<p class="p1">But in order to build lean muscle, you need to know what body type you are. <a href="https://vshred.com/sp/survey/survey-aka1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Take this free body type quiz that tells you exactly what to do to get in shape fast!</a></p>
<p class="p1">Truth is, there are tons of upper body workouts scattering the internet. So how are you supposed to know which ones will actually work?</p>
<p class="p1">Whether an upper body workout is effective or not will come down to three things:</p>
<ol>
<li class="p1">Does it hit all the different muscle groups in your upper body?</li>
<li class="p1">Do you have proper form?</li>
<li class="p1">Is it an easy workout to do?</li>
</ol>
<p class="p1">Meaning, you need to hit your back, chest, shoulders, biceps and triceps all in one. You need to do all the exercises correctly. And you need to be able to do the workout without spending hours and hours in the gym.</p>
<p class="p1">That’s why this is better than the other upper body workouts that you’ve tried. It does all three and more!</p>
<p class="p1">This upper body workout will be three supersets (two exercises performed back to back), targeting all the different muscles groups. And it will only consist of resistance band exercises. Which makes it possible to do at home or even while traveling!</p>
<h2 class="p1">The Upper Body Workouts Layout</h2>
<ul>
<li class="p1">3 supersets</li>
<li class="p1">4 sets</li>
<li class="p1">10-12 reps per set</li>
<li class="p1">1 minute of rest between each set</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="p1">The Exercises:</h3>
<h4 class="p1">Low Banded Row Superset &amp; Banded Bicep Curls</h4>
<p class="p1">Start off by sitting on the ground with your feet straight out in front of you. From there, you will hook the band in the arch of your foot. Then grab the band near your feet and sit back into a 90 degree position with your arms straight out in front of you. You will then focus on driving your elbows back in-line with your belly button and return back to starting position. Repeat for 10-12 reps and go straight into your curls.</p>
<p class="p1">After that, you will get up and stand on the band. Grabbing the handles you will place your feet width depending on how difficult you want the curl to be. Then, keeping your elbows in the same position throughout, curl the weight all the weight up, and return back down slowly. Repeat for 10-12 reps and then rest for a minute. Then do 3 more sets.</p>
<h4 class="p1">Banded Pushup Superset &amp; Overhead Tricep Extensions</h4>
<p class="p1">Here, you will wrap the band around your back and grab it wherever is best fit for your capabilities. After picking your arm width, you will get into push-up position with your hands pressing down on top of the bands. Keeping the band wrapped around your lower shoulders, go down and do a regular pushup. Keep your shoulders rolled back and focus on driving your elbows together to engage your chest. Repeat for 10-12 reps and go straight into tricep extensions.</p>
<p class="p1">For the tricep extensions, you will sit on the band and lift it up over your head. Grab it wherever is best fit for your capabilities and elevate your elbows. From there, keeping your elbows in the same spot, drive your hands up, squeezing your triceps. Once your arms are straight, lower your hands until you are just past a 90 degree angle and go into the next rep. Repeat for 10-12 reps and rest for a minute. Then do 3 more sets and move into the final superset.</p>
<h4 class="p1">Shoulder Press Superset &amp; Lateral Raises</h4>
<p class="p1">For this exercise, you will start standing with the band under your feet. You will want to keep your feet together so that the exercise is not too difficult to perform properly. From there, you want to slightly bring your elbows forward, then push the handles up and together at the top. Then lower your arms until your elbows are just past 90 degrees and go into your next rep. Repeat for 10-12 reps and go straight into lateral raises.</p>
<p class="p1">For this exercise you will continue to stand on the resistance band. But instead of pressing the handles up, we are going to start with our arms down by our side and press the handles outward. By focusing on pressing outward, rather than raising up, you will engage less of your trap muscle to help with better isolation of the delt. Raise until your hands are shoulders level and return your arms back down to your side. Repeat for 10-12 reps, do 3 more sets and you’re done with the workout!</p>
<p class="p1">Next time you’re looking for upper body workouts to try out, give this one a shot and let us know how you like it down below!</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Chest flyes are one of the most important chest workouts you can do in the gym. This exercise targets the lower chest muscles to develop its size and strength. However, a lot of people in the gym tend to execute this workout the wrong way. If you&#8217;re unsure how to properly perform chest flyes, we&#8217;ll help you fix any flaws in your form to maximize your chest workout plan.</p>
<h2>Chest Workouts | Fixing the Chest Flyes</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span style="color: #000080;">Tip #1. Proper Scapular Retraction</span></h3>
<p><iframe class="giphy-embed" src="https://giphy.com/embed/3E4f9HLMY3DqZJfICz" width="480" height="270" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>How your shoulders roll back when doing a chest fly is very important. One of the most common mistakes people do when performing chest flyes is that their shoulders are too high.</p>
<p>Rolling the shoulders up affects a different muscle. Instead of developing your pecs, this incorrect way of performing chest flyes will develop the anterior deltoids. It&#8217;s a waste of time if your main target is the lower chest muscles.</p>
<p>Scapular retraction and depression must go together as you roll your shoulders. Focus on rolling your shoulders back and down as much as possible.</p>
<p>There should be a slight outward turn of your arm as you roll your shoulders down. You should automatically feel a tight squeeze on the serratus anterior or the big swing muscle if done properly.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #000080;">Tip #2. Make sure to squeeze your serratus anterior and lats</span></h3>
<p><iframe class="giphy-embed" src="https://giphy.com/embed/llJVtIYZgvEPVfaahU" width="480" height="270" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>When you press your shoulders back and down when doing chest flyes, you should feel a nice deep squeeze down your lats. The lats or <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/one-back-exercise-superset-to-thicken-widen-your-lats/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">latissimus dorsi</a> is one of the major back muscles.</p>
<p>This will create the strength to use your chest when executing a chest flye. If you feel a squeeze and pressure on the lats, it means your chest flye execution is done correctly.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #000080;">Tip #3. Focus on Arm Abduction and Adduction</span></h3>
<p><iframe class="giphy-embed" src="https://giphy.com/embed/5zvO6EIAHr2WqgoJTK" width="480" height="270" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>Working any muscle involves its shortening and lengthening, including chest workout routines. Doing chest flyes should focus on arm abduction and adduction.</p>
<p>Easy to say but a lot of people are doing it with an outward bend of their elbows, which is incorrect. To work your pectoral muscles, you have to squeeze <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/bicep-tricep-workout-8-arm-exercises-for-bigger-arms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">your biceps</a> together with the elbows pointed downwards.</p>
<p>Trying to get your biceps to touch in a chest flye will give you that nice peak contraction of your pecs. Arm abduction and adduction will maximize the shortening and lengthening of your chest muscles. Try to overemphasize the execution to get the right results in this chest workout.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>See how the actual way chest flyes are done in this video by V Shred:</strong><br />
<iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='1170' height='659' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/1SoJVttMI1w?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></p>
<p>These are the three common mistakes beginners make when doing chest flyes.</p>
<p>Bear in mind you have to retract your scapula in your initial position. This will put your chest in its most advantageous state.</p>
<p>Keep your lats as tight as possible then focus on squeezing your biceps together while keeping your shoulders rolled back and down. Remember these three tips, and you&#8217;re good to go with your chest fly workout.</p>

<p class="p1">This is a great chest fly variation for more chest muscle growth. For this exercise, you will actually be crossing your arms rather than stopping when they are together. This is effective because it over-ensures full range of motion.</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1"><strong>Chest Dips</strong></li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">Dips are a great exercise for the chest and triceps. But one way to make the chest the primary mover is to simply lean forward. As you go throughout the movement, try to keep your upper body as far leaning forward as possible and push through your palms to engage your chest.</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1"><strong>Dumbbell Chest Press</strong></li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">This is a great variation to the barbell bench press. These are good because your hands are not in a fixed position. Instead, they are free moving, allowing for better adduction and abduction of the elbows. This means bringing them outward to the side and in together for a full chest contraction.</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1"><strong>Hammer Strength Chest Press</strong></li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">Chest press machines are always great to change it up from doing barbell or dumbbell press. These allow the chest muscle to be hit from a slightly different angle. Just make sure you always keep your shoulders rolled back to engage your chest.</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1"><strong>Cable Fly Low to High</strong></li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">These are a great chest fly variation for the upper chest. For these, you really want to focus on keeping your chest puffed out at the top just as much as at the bottom. Also, focus on bringing your elbows together, rather than your hands.</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1"><strong>Cable Fly High to Low</strong></li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">These are very similar to the chest fly low to highs, except they target your lower chest. Here, you will focus on the same things.. chest out, shoulders back and bring your elbows together towards the bottom instead of your hands.</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1"><strong>Landmine Press</strong></li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">This exercise is a great way to switch things up and trick your chest muscles into new growth. By always having your hands in on the bar, you will be engaging in the peak contraction more than usual.. which may help the “inner chest” area of the muscle development. For these, continue to make sure you are puffing your chest out so you don’t engage your shoulders too much.</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1"><strong>Plate Press</strong></li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">Plate presses are very similar to the landmine press when talking chest development. This exercise is amazing for constant tension on the chest muscle. By holding two plates together out in front of you, you are always engaging your chest muscles. But due to your hands always being together, you must be careful of your shoulders rolling forward. I like to image that I am holding a pencil in-between my shoulder blades.</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1"><strong>Chest Pullovers</strong></li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">This exercise can be great for chest or lat development. For this reason, you want to be careful to engage your chest as much as possible. This is done by ensuring that you are always squeezing your arms together on the dumbbell. Another thing to be careful of is stretching back too far, as this will take the focus off the chest and put it on the back. Establish that mind-muscle connection and keep it the whole time.</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1"><strong>Hammer Strength Side Press</strong></li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">This is an effective chest press variation to change things up from the normal exercises. For these, you will turn to the side and focus on one side at a time. You want to make sure you’re never losing tension by going back too far with the weight. Then, keeping your shoulder rolled back, press the bar across your body and squeeze at the top. Make sure to count your reps so you do the same amount on both arms.</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1"><strong>Pec Deck Fly</strong></li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">The pec deck fly is a great exercise that has been used for years and years for chest development. Here, you will sit on a bench and bring the hands together out in front of you. When doing this exercise, you want to make sure you’re not letting your shoulders roll forward and your upper back to come off the pad. By keeping your shoulders rolled back, in the same place, you will increase your chest activation as much as possible.</p>
<p class="p1">One thing to be careful of is combining too many exercises together at once. Pick 4 exercises and stick with them for 4-6 weeks and then switch it up.</p>

<p class="p1"><a href="https://vshred.com/sp/survey/survey-aka1" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>If you’re looking to get in shape, you need to stop the one-size-fits-all approach.. and follow a plan for your body type. Take our free body type quiz now to find out the exact diet and training that’s right for you.</strong></a></p>
<p class="p1">If you want to build a bigger, more pronounced chest, upper chest training is a must. And while there are plenty of ways to do that, there are better ways than others.</p>
<p class="p1">Here is one quick and easy upper chest workout fix to help you get the best chest workout possible.</p>
<h2 class="p1">Best Chest Workout Fix</h2>
<p class="p1">This chest workout fix is going to be all about the incline cable flyes. Why? Because they are a fantastic exercise for the upper chest.</p>
<p class="p1">But while they are a great exercise, they are also executed incorrectly all the time. If you have ever done incline chest flyes and you have felt it more in your shoulders.. you’re not alone.</p>
<p class="p1">Truth is, all upper chest exercises are going to work your shoulders a little bit.. primarily, your front deltoid. This and not accentuating proper form, leads to targeting your shoulders more than your actual pectoral muscle.</p>
<p class="p1">So one way that has been found to help chest activation can be utilized by doing the following:</p>
<ol>
<li class="p1">Start out with your arms in-line with your body and down to the side, not behind you. This will allow less immediate stress on your shoulders.</li>
<li class="p1">Next, make sure your chest is puffed out and your scapula is retracted. (Act as if you are trying to pinch a pencil between your shoulder blades.)</li>
<li class="p1">Then, rather than bringing your hands together at the top.. you will focus on bringing your elbows together at the bottom.</li>
<li class="p1">From there, you will act as if you are trying to pinch a pencil between your shoulder blades AND your pecs. While doing this, you will raise your elbows up to shoulder level. (Make sure you continue to puff your chest out farther than your shoulders.)</li>
<li class="p1">Then, keeping your pecs squeezed together and puffed out, you will lower your elbows.. then allow them to separate back to starting position. This is one rep.</li>
</ol>
<p class="p1">Repeat this for as many reps and as many sets as your workout calls for. If done correctly, hopefully you will find your pectoral stimulation has increased and your shoulder stimulation has decreased.</p>
<h3 class="p1">Bonus:</h3>
<ul>
<li class="p1">These tips work for all chest exercises:</li>
<li class="p1">Rolling your shoulders back</li>
<li class="p1">Keeping your chest puffed out</li>
<li class="p1">Focusing on bringing your elbows together rather than your hands</li>
</ul>
