								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With all the workout plans for weight loss available online, how do you know which one to follow? It can be difficult to separate effective programs from scams. Luckily, we’ve narrowed the list down to our favorite VShred weight-loss programs backed by scientific evidence and actual results. Check out these workout plans below to see which one fits your goals.</p>
<h2>Top 7 Effective Workout Plans for Weight Loss</h2>
<h3>1. Fat Loss Extreme for Him</h3>
<p><!-- instagram error: invalid instagram resource --></p>
<p>This workout regimen is exactly what it sounds like. Fat Loss Extreme for Him is specifically designed for men who want to drop 20+ lbs. of excess fat as soon as possible.</p>
<p>This<a href="https://vshred.com/programs/fat-loss-extreme?ref=programs" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> step-by-step blueprint</a> is everything you need to finally shed fat and reveal your well-sculpted muscles. Plus, it’s very simple to follow!</p>
<p>It’s a plan tailored for men like you. Just lift what we tell you to lift and eat what we tell you to eat.</p>
<h3>2. Fat Loss Extreme for Her</h3>
<p>While other weight-loss plans designed for women tell you to starve yourself and spend countless hours on the treadmill, <a href="https://vshred.com/sp/fat-loss-extreme-f/sku_CKcwR4TEg54IeG?ref=programs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fat Loss Extreme for Her</a> is different. If you’re tired of back-breaking crunches, boring treadmill sessions, and expensive cleansing diets, then we have what you’re looking for.</p>
<p>This workout plan guides you every step of the way. It tells you what to eat, what to lift, and when to rest. Unlike other plans, we’re telling you right now that this plan won’t force you to buy expensive detox juices or run for two hours on the treadmill.</p>
<p>It consists of short, explosive workouts, that you can do from home, specifically designed to stimulate weight-loss among female athletes and fitness enthusiasts alike.</p>
<h3>3. Ripped in 90 Days</h3>
<p><!-- instagram error: invalid instagram resource --></p>
<p>If you’re bulking, you need to consume more calories and do heavy exercises. Meanwhile, athletes trying to cut down on weight should focus on light, high-repetition exercises while minimizing their calorie intake.</p>
<p>This is what makes it almost impossible to build a muscular body while shredding fat. Luckily, V Shred offers a program designed to help you lose fat while packing on muscle mass.</p>
<p><a href="https://vshred.com/sp/ripped-in-90-days/sku_AR6nTj3PTK3uu9?ref=programs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ripped in 90 Days</a> is a workout plan that tells you exactly what to eat and how many calories you need to consume.</p>
<p>At the same time, it tells you what exercises to do on a specific day of the week. All you need to do is commit to the program and you’ll start seeing results almost immediately.</p>
<h3>4. Toned in 90 Days</h3>
<p>The truth is, not everyone wants to pack on heavy muscle mass. Most women aim for a tight, lean body. Sadly, most workout plans that promise this are simply the same starvation diets slapped with a different brand.</p>
<p>If you’re looking for something different, then <a href="https://vshred.com/sp/toned-in-90-days/v1/?ref=programs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Toned in 90 Days</a> is perfect for you! It’s one of the best workout plans for weight loss that helps you lose fat without losing muscle.</p>
<p>It not only helps you lose weight, but it also makes you leaner and stronger.</p>
<h3>5. Six-Pack Shred</h3>
<p><!-- instagram error: invalid instagram resource --></p>
<p>Are you tired of the generic ab-workout programs that do nothing but force you to do thousands of back-breaking sit-ups? The truth is, all those crunches won’t do anything unless they&#8217;re combined with other strength-training exercises and proper nutrition.</p>
<p><a href="https://vshred.com/sp/six-pack-shred/v1/?ref=programs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Six-Pack Shred</a> is a program designed to help you shred enough fat to get visible abs in just 12 weeks if you follow this plan.</p>
<h3>6. Customized Diet and Training Plan for Her</h3>
<p>Personal trainers or nutritionists are there to help athletes achieve their dream body faster than they could on their own. They create specialized diet and workout plans for weight loss which you can use.</p>
<p>However, they charge hundreds of dollars per session and it’s not practical for the average female gym-goer to hire one. Luckily, you don’t need to spend thousands of dollars just to get your dream body.</p>
<p><a href="https://vshred.com/sp/custom-training-and-diet-plan-8-week-f/sku_BQR5AzD0pv4obg?ref=programs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Customized Diet and Training Plan for Her</a> is like a personal trainer that tells you exactly what you need to do every single day with unlimited support and weekly adjustments. The main difference is it doesn’t cost nearly as much as a personal trainer would.</p>
<h3>7. Customized Diet and Training Plan for Him</h3>
<p><!-- instagram error: invalid instagram resource --></p>
<p>If you want to make any real progress with your body, ditch the generic workout routines you previously bought. V Shred understands that different people have varying needs. This means that while a workout routine may be effective for us, it doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean they&#8217;re effective for you as well.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why we created the <a href="https://vshred.com/programs/custom-training-and-diet-plan-8-week?ref=programs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Customized Diet and Training Plan for Him</a>. It&#8217;s a customized nutrition and workout guide where we give you plans tailored especially for you. It&#8217;s loaded with all the workout routines and diet plans you need to follow for the next coming weeks.</p>
<p>Think of it as hiring a personal trainer you have access to 24/7. Except with us, you won&#8217;t be spending nearly as much as you would have with an actual trainer.</p>

<iframe src="//youtube.com/embed/luffPlJiTHI" class="embed-responsive-item box-shadow-wide" width="100%" height="500" scrolling="yes" frameborder="0"></iframe>
</div>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://vshred.com/sp/survey/survey-aka1?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=post&amp;utm_campaign=v-shred&amp;utm_content=leg-day-workout-done-at-home-bodyweight-only&amp;utm_term=4" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>But after you do this workout, you need to make sure the rest of your workouts and your diet are taken care of. Use this free body type quiz to find out exactly how to get in shape faster and easier!</strong></a></p>
<p class="p1">Leg workouts are far from hard to find. But the best leg workout can be a little more difficult to figure out.</p>
<p class="p1">This one is a bunch of bodyweight exercises that maintain optimal tension on your muscles. Also, this is extremely effective for getting the right amount of volume that your legs need to get stronger and firmer!</p>
<h2 class="p1">The Best Leg Day Workout</h2>
<p class="p1">This leg day workout will consist of 5 different exercises. Each exercise will be performed for 3 sets of 15 reps with a one minute rest in between each set.</p>
<h3 class="p1">The Exercises</h3>
<h4 class="p1">Squat Rocks</h4>
<p class="p1">For this first exercise, you will start down in the bottom position of a squat. From there, you will remain as low as you can, while going forward and up on your toes. This should work your calves nicely. Then lower your heels back down to the ground. After your heels are back down, remain down in the squat position and shift your weight back on your heels and lift your toes off the ground. Then return your toes back to the ground and rock back and forth like this 15 times both ways. Then you will rest for one minute and repeat for 3 sets.</p>
<h4 class="p1">3 Point Lunges</h4>
<p class="p1">Here, you will be doing a series of lunges in 3 different directions. So starting by standing up straight, you will first lunge forward.. Then bring your foot back in, without touching it back on the ground, you will immediately go into a side lunge with that same leg. Then bring it back in and without touching it to the ground, immediately go into a back lunge. Then witch legs and do this with the opposite leg. After you have worked your way all the way around, that will be one rep. Repeat for 15 reps total and rest for a minute. Then do it twice more and move into the next exercise.</p>
<h4 class="p1">Frog Pumps</h4>
<p class="p1">This is a great exercise for the glutes and are very similar to glute bridges. You will start by laying on your back, then bring your feet in closer so your knees are similar to sit-up position. After that, you’ll bring your heels together so they are touching each other. Then drive your heels into the ground with your knees wider than your feet and bridge up as high as you can. Return your back back to about an inch off the ground and repeat for 15 reps.</p>
<h4 class="p1">4 Way Squat Hops</h4>
<p class="p1">For this exercise, you are going to be doing squat hops in four directions. So standing up straight, you will go down into a squat, then hop up off the ground to your left side. Then immediately go into a squat and hop up and jump back to where you just came from. Then squat down and hop to the right. Squat down hop back to the middle again. Then rather than going back to the left, you will squat down and hop forward. Then squat down again and hop back to the middle. Then as the last direction, you’ll squat down and hop backwards. Then squat down and hop back to the middle again. This will equal one rep. Repeat this left, right, forward and backward method for 15 total reps then rest for a minute. Repeat two more times and move into the final exercise.</p>
<h4 class="p1">Alternating Single Leg RDL Hops</h4>
<p class="p1">For the last exercise, you will start out by doing a single leg RDL. So starting off by balancing on one leg, you will bend forward, keeping a soft bend in your leg that on the ground, then bring your opposite leg going out behind you. Then tap your fingers to the ground and explode through your glutes and hamstrings to drive your back leg up and hop off the ground. Then after landing back on the ground, switch legs and do the exact same to the other side. Repeat for 15 reps with each leg. After you’ve done 15 reps, rest for a minute and repeat 2 more times.</p>
<p class="p1">Once all exercises are completed for 3 sets of 15 reps, you are done with the workout!</p>

<p><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='1170' height='659' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/4YVT_SveWo4?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></p>
<p class="p1">But in order to build lean muscle, you need to know what body type you are. <a href="https://vshred.com/sp/survey/survey-aka1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Take this free body type quiz that tells you exactly what to do to get in shape fast!</a></p>
<p class="p1">Truth is, there are tons of upper body workouts scattering the internet. So how are you supposed to know which ones will actually work?</p>
<p class="p1">Whether an upper body workout is effective or not will come down to three things:</p>
<ol>
<li class="p1">Does it hit all the different muscle groups in your upper body?</li>
<li class="p1">Do you have proper form?</li>
<li class="p1">Is it an easy workout to do?</li>
</ol>
<p class="p1">Meaning, you need to hit your back, chest, shoulders, biceps and triceps all in one. You need to do all the exercises correctly. And you need to be able to do the workout without spending hours and hours in the gym.</p>
<p class="p1">That’s why this is better than the other upper body workouts that you’ve tried. It does all three and more!</p>
<p class="p1">This upper body workout will be three supersets (two exercises performed back to back), targeting all the different muscles groups. And it will only consist of resistance band exercises. Which makes it possible to do at home or even while traveling!</p>
<h2 class="p1">The Upper Body Workouts Layout</h2>
<ul>
<li class="p1">3 supersets</li>
<li class="p1">4 sets</li>
<li class="p1">10-12 reps per set</li>
<li class="p1">1 minute of rest between each set</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="p1">The Exercises:</h3>
<h4 class="p1">Low Banded Row Superset &amp; Banded Bicep Curls</h4>
<p class="p1">Start off by sitting on the ground with your feet straight out in front of you. From there, you will hook the band in the arch of your foot. Then grab the band near your feet and sit back into a 90 degree position with your arms straight out in front of you. You will then focus on driving your elbows back in-line with your belly button and return back to starting position. Repeat for 10-12 reps and go straight into your curls.</p>
<p class="p1">After that, you will get up and stand on the band. Grabbing the handles you will place your feet width depending on how difficult you want the curl to be. Then, keeping your elbows in the same position throughout, curl the weight all the weight up, and return back down slowly. Repeat for 10-12 reps and then rest for a minute. Then do 3 more sets.</p>
<h4 class="p1">Banded Pushup Superset &amp; Overhead Tricep Extensions</h4>
<p class="p1">Here, you will wrap the band around your back and grab it wherever is best fit for your capabilities. After picking your arm width, you will get into push-up position with your hands pressing down on top of the bands. Keeping the band wrapped around your lower shoulders, go down and do a regular pushup. Keep your shoulders rolled back and focus on driving your elbows together to engage your chest. Repeat for 10-12 reps and go straight into tricep extensions.</p>
<p class="p1">For the tricep extensions, you will sit on the band and lift it up over your head. Grab it wherever is best fit for your capabilities and elevate your elbows. From there, keeping your elbows in the same spot, drive your hands up, squeezing your triceps. Once your arms are straight, lower your hands until you are just past a 90 degree angle and go into the next rep. Repeat for 10-12 reps and rest for a minute. Then do 3 more sets and move into the final superset.</p>
<h4 class="p1">Shoulder Press Superset &amp; Lateral Raises</h4>
<p class="p1">For this exercise, you will start standing with the band under your feet. You will want to keep your feet together so that the exercise is not too difficult to perform properly. From there, you want to slightly bring your elbows forward, then push the handles up and together at the top. Then lower your arms until your elbows are just past 90 degrees and go into your next rep. Repeat for 10-12 reps and go straight into lateral raises.</p>
<p class="p1">For this exercise you will continue to stand on the resistance band. But instead of pressing the handles up, we are going to start with our arms down by our side and press the handles outward. By focusing on pressing outward, rather than raising up, you will engage less of your trap muscle to help with better isolation of the delt. Raise until your hands are shoulders level and return your arms back down to your side. Repeat for 10-12 reps, do 3 more sets and you’re done with the workout!</p>

<p class="p1"><a href="https://vshred.com/sp/survey/survey-aka1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Don’t forget.. If you’re trying to get in shape, the biggest mistake you can make it guessing what to do. If you’re ready to be told exactly how to diet and what workouts to do, click here to take our free body type quiz now!</strong></a></p>
<p class="p1">Well developed and toned shoulders is one of the most noticeable places on the body. Whether you have a shirt on or shirt off, shoulder muscle is something we all strive for.</p>
<p class="p1">But if you’re someone who likes working out from home, finding the best shoulder exercises can be difficult. Until now…</p>
<p class="p1">Pick 4 or 5 of these at-home shoulder exercises the next time you want to workout from home.</p>
<h2 class="p1">Best Shoulder Exercises</h2>
<h3 class="p1">Handstand Pushups</h3>
<p class="p1">These are the most difficult of the exercises listed but for good reason. Handstand pushups are amazing for targeting all areas of your shoulders.. while helping with strength and mobility. Make sure you have a sturdy wall to hold you up and maybe a pad under your head in case you fall!</p>
<h3 class="p1">Pike Pushups</h3>
<p class="p1">This exercise is a great beginner variation to the handstand pushups.. or just a great exercise in general. Starting in the pushup position, you will raise your butt up in the air and bring your hands closer to your feet. From there, you will lower yourself until your head is an inch off the ground and push back up.</p>
<h3 class="p1">Dive-bomber Pushups</h3>
<p class="p1">These are amazing for your shoulders as well as your arms. Starting in the same position as a pike pushup, you will dive down towards your hands… I like to act as if I’m trying to get my body under a fence. From there, you will continue the forward motion but you will push up and out into somewhat similar of a seal position. Then return back “under the fence” and push yourself back up like a pike pushup.</p>
<h3 class="p1">Pushback Pushups</h3>
<p class="p1">This exercise is a great explosive shoulder workout. For these you are going to start on your feet with your knees bent and hands out ready to catch you. From there, you will act as if you are going down into a quick pushup. But instead of doing a pushup, you will throw yourself back onto your feet. Focus on using your shoulder muscles as explosively as possible.</p>
<h3 class="p1">Floor Y-Raises</h3>
<p class="p1">These are great for shoulder toning as they do not require much strength but require a good contraction. You will start by lying on your belly with your feet together and your arms up in a “Y” position. From there, you will roll your shoulders back and lift your arms up off the ground as high as you can. Once at max height, squeeze and hold for one second and return them back to the floor.</p>
<h3 class="p1">Floor T-Raises</h3>
<p class="p1">These are very similar to the floor y-raises but instead of creating a “Y” with your body, you will create a “T”. So lay on your stomach with your feet together. Then put your arms directly out to the side. From there, you will again, roll your shoulders back… Then lift your arms up off the ground as high as you can, hold for one second, and return to the ground.</p>
<h3 class="p1">Floor Reverse Fly</h3>
<p class="p1">These are great for the shoulders and back. For this exercise, you will lay on your back with your arms out to the side and feet together. From there, you will focus on using your tailbone and your elbows as the point of contact with the ground. Then you will roll your shoulders back and focus on lifting your upper body off the ground, while driving through your elbows and keeping your lower back muscles tight.</p>
<p class="p1">Try 4 or 5 of these best shoulder exercises together for 3 sets of 10-15 each. Doing these will ensure you target all muscles of your shoulders and get a great workout!</p>

<p class="p1">When it comes to building an impressive back, you must make sure you are performing exercises for width and thickness.</p>
<p class="p1">Width is going to come from rowing exercises.</p>
<p class="p1">Thickness is going to come from pull down exercises.</p>
<p class="p1">Another really useful tool for performing exercises like these is supersets.</p>
<p class="p1">A superset is when you perform two exercises back to back and rest after, rather than resting after a single exercise.</p>
<p class="p1">Now, the issue with supersets is that when the gym is busy, it’s difficult to keep two machines at once.</p>
<p class="p1">So what’s awesome about this superset is that it only requires one cable row machine for both exercises.</p>
<p class="p1">So you will start with a wide grip seated row with the lat pulldown bar, and make sure you’re pulling through your elbows and pulling down toward your belly button to target your lats more.</p>
<p class="p1">Then, you will drop your legs behind the seat with your hips holding you in position and your chest on the pad. From here you will perform the movement as a lat pulldown.</p>
<p class="p1">With the lat pulldown, continue focusing on pulling down through your elbows so that you engage your lats as much as possible.</p>
<p class="p1">Perform as many sets and reps as you’d like, I recommend 3-4 sets of 10-12 reps of each and you should be good for this superset.</p>
<p class="p1">Let me know what you think down below!</p>

<p class="p1">A nice set of six pack abs is typically going to be found attractive to the majority of people.</p>
<p class="p1">But when trying to get six pack abs, the path can seem quite difficult..</p>
<p class="p1">Especially when you’re doing the wrong exercises.</p>
<p class="p1">In this video..</p>
<p class="p1">I show you the worst ab exercise that there is.</p>
<p class="p1">But to be clear..</p>
<p class="p1">I am not saying this is the worst ab exercises that there is for everybody.</p>
<p class="p1">This ab exercise is pretty much a waste of time for anyone who can hold it for longer than a minute.</p>
<p class="p1">It’s the <strong>plank</strong>!</p>
<p class="p1">Yes, the plank is being presented the award for the worst ab exercise due to it’s simplicity.</p>
<p class="p1">Now, I’m not saying simplicity isn’t amazing sometimes.</p>
<p class="p1">But there always comes a line when it’s time to change things up.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>And like I said..</strong></p>
<p class="p1">If you can hold a plank for longer than 60 seconds..</p>
<p class="p1">Stop. Doing. Them.</p>
<p class="p1">Why?</p>
<p class="p1">Well, planks are an isometric core strength exercise that require you to hold for long periods of time.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>But what happens is..</strong></p>
<p class="p1">When you get a little more experienced with the exercise..</p>
<p class="p1">And your core gets stronger..</p>
<p class="p1">The plank is not going to be a very challenging exercise.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>So that means..</strong></p>
<p class="p1">What will end up happening is after a minute of a plank..</p>
<p class="p1">Typically, your body will start emphasizing other body parts.</p>
<p class="p1">Like your shoulders..</p>
<p class="p1">Or your stick your butt in the air a little and pinch your low back muscles.</p>
<p class="p1">So unless you are focusing on engaging your core the entire time..</p>
<p class="p1">Try out the three plank variations in this video to take your planks up a notch!</p>
<p class="p1">Let me know what you think down below!</p>
