That is a scary number!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Good thing you found this article because </span><b><i>we aren’t going to let YOU be “most” people! </i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lower temps do not have to equal larger waistlines! You just have to have a plan! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this short read we will &#8230;</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Explain why winter weight gain happens. Knowing why is important if you want to prevent it and the reason is probably not what you think. In fact, it is partially not even your fault!</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tell you why fall/winter is actually the BEST time to start a diet and training plan.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Give you 7 easy pro tips that will help guide you through the next few months. </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You may believe winter weight gain happens because of the holidays. Those extra home cooked meals and holiday parties are certainly a factor. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But </span><b><i>there is a DAILY issue you need to be prepared to fight </i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">if you want to avoid packing on winter pounds.</span></p>
<p><b>WHY YOU REALLY PACK ON POUNDS AFTER LABOR DAY</b></p>
<p><img class="size-large wp-image-7471" src="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_130930953.jpeg?resize=1024%2C512&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="512" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_130930953.jpeg?resize=1024%2C512&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_130930953.jpeg?resize=300%2C150&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_130930953.jpeg?resize=768%2C384&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_130930953.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_130930953.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the spring and summer months, you are given what we call a</span><b> fitness freebie. </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You get a </span><b><i>seasonal motivation boost</i></b> <span style="font-weight: 400;">that doesn’t happen when temperatures start to drop, and you begin to pull out the chunky sweaters and comfy leggings. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not only is the sun shining (which makes you happier because of Vitamin D), you are wearing LESS clothing in the summer months. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I don’t know about you, but knowing I’m going to be exposing more skin makes walking in the gym a little easier. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Covering up in layers, no doubt leads to the temptation to slack on body goals! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Knowing your arms, legs, and abs will be less exposed can easily be an excuse to slack. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, being layered up often means you don’t SEE the extra pounds, so they are easier to ignore.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But there is more to it than being bundled up….</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-7477" src="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_236518834.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_236518834.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_236518834.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_236518834.jpeg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_236518834.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_236518834.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span>The #1 reason you slack on health and fitness goals in colder months ISN’T EVEN YOUR FAULT!!</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, you have a part to play in all of this, but</span><b><i> there is actually a scientific reason why you have less desire to train and eat healthy when the sunshine of summer fades.</i></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We will explain why a little further down. But ya know what really stinks? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The scientific reason why we all experience these motivation slumps in the winter only adds to an even bigger issue with motivation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span>It doesn’t matter what season it is motivation ALWAYS comes and goes!</p>
<p>Spring, Summer, Fall, or Winter &#8211; you can NEVER rely on it!</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, what can you do when lack of sunshine and warm temps leave you even more tempted to hit snooze and reach for comfort foods? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You certainly don’t throw your hands up in the air and wait until January to make a resolution to crash diet to get your body ready for spring. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Believe it or not, RIGHT NOW is actually the IDEAL time to get started! </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you </span><b><i>START NOW, </i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">you will develop discipline and a routine heading into the holidays. This will put you in a great place mentally and physically to relax and “indulge” a little more at all those holiday gatherings! </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><b><i>Look at it this way ..<br />
</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Would you rather head into the holiday season already making progress toward your goals and be in a great spot <em>(where it would be okay even if you did gain an extra pound or two?)</em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Or would you rather put it off and only add more fat on top of what you want to lose?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The answer is clear— the solution to getting the motivation needed to make it happen, not so much.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But don’t worry! We’ve got ya covered</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (no pun intended)</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with a few easy motivation hacks!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><b>7 TIPS TO STAY MOTIVATED AS SEASONS CHANGE</b></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><b><br />
</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the number one questions we always get is … “<em>I am just not motivated. How can I motivate myself to train and eat better?”</em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As we mentioned earlier, it doesn&#8217;t matter what season it is, </span><b><i>you can’t always rely on motivation. </i></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you have it, great! You should certainly take advantage of it! But you have to know that it is totally normal to not have much of it. Even professional athletes lack motivation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You have to develop other daily habits that create discipline if you want to succeed long term!</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are a few of our pro tips that we use with our clients, specifically when temperatures drop, and motivation seems to be at its lowest! </span></p>
<p><b>TIP #1: Switch To An At Home Training Program</b></p>
<p><img class="size-large wp-image-7448" src="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_185038762.jpeg?resize=1024%2C647&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="647" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_185038762.jpeg?resize=1024%2C647&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_185038762.jpeg?resize=300%2C189&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_185038762.jpeg?resize=768%2C485&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_185038762.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_185038762.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you know that getting out of bed and stepping into the winter elements is going to be an excuse trigger, make a plan to train at home during cooler months! Some of the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">most effective and challenging workouts </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">only require your body weight and </span><b><i>maybe</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a set of dumbbells or some resistance bands.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A good fat-blasting, muscle-building sweat session can 100% be achieved from the comfort of your home!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adjustable dumbbells, ankle weights, resistance bands, a jump rope, etc., are all things that are inexpensive and can easily be stored in a closet or under your bed and pulled out anytime you don’t feel like leaving the house.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But if you have </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">the right training program</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><b><i>you don’t need any of that. </i></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our favorite </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">at-home bodyweight-only program</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is called</span><b> MOVE. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was designed to help you achieve your fitness goals without a single piece of equipment, and each workout is under 20 minutes! </span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Learn more about MOVE by watching the video below!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you need </span><b>a little extra “nudge”</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to get up and get moving, another </span><b>pro-tip we use</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is keeping some </span><a href="https://sculptnation.com/products/pre-workout" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><b>PRE WORKOUT </b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">on your bedside table. Have it already blended up and chug it as soon as your alarm goes off!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By the time you have brushed your teeth and put on your workout clothes, you will have a nice little jolt of energy and</span><b><i> tons of motivation</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to get going before you have a chance to come up with an excuse! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the bottom of this article, we will tell you about a big end of summer sale happening so that you can stock up on our </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">favorite </span><a href="https://sculptnation.com/products/pre-workout" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><b>PRE WORKOUT</b></a><strong> for 40% off when you use code: LABORDAY40 at checkout! </strong></p>
<p><b>TIP #2: Make Your Workouts Seasonal</b></p>
<p><img class="size-large wp-image-7452" src="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_65703942.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_65703942.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_65703942.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_65703942.jpeg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_65703942.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_65703942.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Embrace the change of seasons and take advantage of activities that you can only do in fall or winter! </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Go on a fall hike and view all the gorgeous foliage.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Try rock climbing.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Walk around a corn maze or pumpkin patch with your family. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you live in a snowy climate, go skiing, sledding, build snowmen with your kids, etc.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Go ice skating.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lace-up your sneakers, go for a walk or run at night, and admire all the Christmas lights and decorations.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are some things you can only do and see during specific times of the year. So instead of missing sunshine and water sports, focus on all the positive things that only come about with cooler temps!</span></p>
<p><b>TIP #3: Try Something Totally New</b></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-7454" src="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_361152601.jpeg?resize=1024%2C514&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="514" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_361152601.jpeg?resize=1024%2C514&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_361152601.jpeg?resize=300%2C151&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_361152601.jpeg?resize=768%2C386&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_361152601.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_361152601.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sometimes a change of routine is all you need to boost motivation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you have been doing all your gym lifts alone, recruit a gym buddy! Try switching up your cardio by skipping your solo runs and joining a group fitness class instead. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another option is to </span><b><i>allow yourself to slow down!</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> If you have been crushing it all spring and summer with intense training and hardcore workouts, </span><b><i>it may actually be time to take it down a notch. </i></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Going full force 365 can cause your stress hormone cortisol to increase. This can lead to a host of drawbacks, including weight gain, muscle loss, poor moods, fatigue, and occasional issues sleeping! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We aren’t saying you should become lazy! But if you have been crushing it 24/7 all spring and summer, your body (and mind) may need to slow down.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Use the next few months to embrace a slower routine. </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Commit to daily yoga.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Focus on becoming more flexible.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Switch to low or moderate-intensity cardio, instead of HIIT.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Try out some bodyweight workouts instead of heavy lifting.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Giving your body a couple of months to recover might even make you more responsive when you decide to kick things up again come spring/summer!</span></p>
<p><b>TIP #4: Stay Accountable</b></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-7457" src="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_266584820.jpeg?resize=1024%2C768&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="768" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_266584820.jpeg?resize=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_266584820.jpeg?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_266584820.jpeg?resize=768%2C576&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_266584820.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_266584820.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><b><br />
</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">The best way to stick to a plan is to have someone that you report back to. This could be a friend, family member, a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">social media community</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, or even a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">coach. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Including someone else, or even just telling someone else about your health and fitness goals and asking them to check in with you to make sure you are sticking to the plan, is a great way to keep the promises you make to yourself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you prefer to fly solo, it helps to create visuals. Make a vision board, create a daily checklist you can mark off after each workout, or keep an accomplishment journal.</span></p>
<p><b>TIP #5: Set A Spring Goal</b></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-7458" src="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_47332240.jpeg?resize=1024%2C680&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="680" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_47332240.jpeg?resize=1024%2C680&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_47332240.jpeg?resize=300%2C199&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_47332240.jpeg?resize=768%2C510&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_47332240.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_47332240.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">March may seem like a long time away, but it will be back before you know it, and 6 months is a long time to make significant changes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Setting a goal is a great way to encourage yourself to push past discomforts and temptation, but there is a science to goal setting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The key to creating goals that stick .. </span><b><i>be REALISTIC and SPECIFIC!</i></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s start with </span><b><i>reality. </i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">You should always focus on one goal at a time and make sure you are being honest with yourself if that goal is really attainable.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you know that your schedule will never allow you to work out 6 days a week, why would you choose a program that requires you to do that?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you know it’s not healthy to attempt to lose 10 pounds a week, why would you aim that high?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you love carbs, why would you go on a KETO diet? </span></p>
<p><b><i>Doing these things will essentially set yourself up for failure.</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Set attainable goals that fit YOUR lifestyle. You can always bump things up if your schedule allows, or you notice you aren’t pushing yourself hard enough. Just keep in mind that being realistic isn’t the same as not believing in yourself or making excuses. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moving on to being </span><b><i>specific.</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The more specific you are about your goals, the more likely you will be to reach them. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It may seem like it’s good enough to say things like .. I want to look good, lose weight, or get ripped! </span><b><i>But you have to dig deeper than that!! </i></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wanting to “lose weight,” for example, is an excellent place to start. But ask yourself what that means to you?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you expand on that and say &#8212; “I want to lose 10 pounds of fat. I will do this by not eating any sweets and doing the V Shred </span><a href="https://vshred.com/sp/move/soc-all/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><b>MOVE </b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">program for 30 consecutive days. I am doing this because I want to have better self-esteem and a head start on bikini season.” &#8212; that makes your goal more specific.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The more specific (and attainable) your goals are, the more likely you will be to not give up!</span></p>
<p><b>TIP #6: Reward Yourself</b></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-7459" src="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/vin_sant_32048508_366936073798151_433609263865135104_n.jpg?resize=882%2C1024&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="882" height="1024" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/vin_sant_32048508_366936073798151_433609263865135104_n.jpg?resize=882%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 882w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/vin_sant_32048508_366936073798151_433609263865135104_n.jpg?resize=258%2C300&amp;ssl=1 258w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/vin_sant_32048508_366936073798151_433609263865135104_n.jpg?resize=768%2C892&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/vin_sant_32048508_366936073798151_433609263865135104_n.jpg?w=1080&amp;ssl=1 1080w" sizes="(max-width: 882px) 100vw, 882px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you have checked a “mini goal” off your list, treat yourself. Knowing that you have a reward coming to celebrate your efforts will make you want to achieve it even more. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It may be tempting to make your reward one of your favorite “forbidden foods” but we never suggest that you reward yourself this way.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You aren’t a dog. You should never reward “good behavior” with food. Having this mentality can create a really unhealthy relationship with food.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You need to eat healthy MOST of the time, control your portions, and see food as fuel. But if you are craving something that isn’t quite as healthy as your grilled chicken and rice, never feel like you need to lose 20 pounds to “deserve” a bite of cake, or nice dinner out with your family. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instead of rewarding yourself with food, buy yourself something you have been wanting. Maybe some new workout clothes, a massage, or an extra $20 bucks in your vacation fund! </span></p>

<p><b>TIP #7: Make Mental Health Top Priority</b></p>
<p><img class="size-large wp-image-7460" src="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_255894146.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_255894146.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_255894146.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_255894146.jpeg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_255894146.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_255894146.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Earlier, we mentioned that cold weather motivation dips may not be your fault.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’m sure you have heard of winter blues. Well, it’s a real thing. Less natural light can cause dips in serotonin, the neurotransmitter that regulates mood.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The dark and dreary days of winter can also cause your body to produce more of the sleep hormone melatonin. This shift can disrupt your body and impact your sleep patterns and overall mood.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are a few ways that you can focus on improving your mental health.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Invest in a light therapy box that simulates natural daylight.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Make sure you are supplementing with or eating plenty of foods with Vitamin D.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Start journaling. There is a lot of scientific evidence that supports putting your thoughts on paper provides a long list of benefits, including stress management, self-confidence, and goal setting. </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Suppose you still find yourself struggling with negative seasonal motivation shifts. In that case, you may need to experiment with taking</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> naturally sourced herbs</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to help support brain health and a positive mood.</span></p>
<p><b><i>Here are a few with some great scientific backing to help boost mood.</i></b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>EnXtra: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">A natural caffeine-free patent-pending botanical ingredient that has been shown to help increase dopamine levels.**It is also one of the first and only natural caffeine-free patent-pending botanical ingredients shown to boost mental alertness &amp; acuity for hours or ending in a huge caffeine energy crash.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Piper Nigrum Fruit Extract:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> A very specific type of black pepper that has been shown to help increase both serotonin and dopamine.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>L-Theanine:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> A powerful amino acid that is believed to help reduce occasional anxiety brought on by stressful situations.</span></li>
</ul>

<p><b><i>BOTTOM LINE IF YOU WANT TO STAY MOTIVATED YEAR ROUND</i></b><b><i><br />
</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you put away the shorts and swimsuits and shift out of bikini season, it’s common for motivation to “fall back” with the clocks. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The seasons have to change (unless you live near the equator) &#8211; so you have to figure out ways to</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">not let your fitness goals go into hibernation mode!</span><b><i> </i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pumpkin spice lattes are only here for a limited time, but getting into shape isn’t seasonal! </span><i>It&#8217;s a year-round commitment!!</i><i> </i></p>

<p>It is that time of year!! 4th of July is upon us!!</p>
<p>Burgers on the grill … fireworks in the sky … and for many .. an excuse to skip the gym and eat thousands of calories .. in one sitting!</p>
<p>It can be tempting to throw your diet and training mindset out the window when holidays come around. But you must treat holidays just like you would any other day.</p>
<p>Have fun .. enjoy the time with family … and even enjoy all the food .. but keep your goals in mind. One of the best things you can do .. is still get in a solid workout!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>We’ve got the perfect 4th of July PRE PARTY PUMP!</strong></em></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-7322" src="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_8006.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_8006.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_8006.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_8006.jpeg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_8006.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>The workout we&#8217;re giving you below will not only burn a ton of calories .. the endorphins released from this short HIIT workout will boost your mood .. which will help you keep your healthy food habits in mind when it’s time to fire up the grill!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>We will never tell you that you need to “earn” your calories .. that is not the kind of relationship with food we promote here at V Shred &amp; Sculpt Nation.</strong></em></p>
<p>Food should never be seen as “the enemy” or “a reward” .. and exercise should never be viewed as punishment.</p>
<p>Diet culture makes us feel bad about having a nice dinner with friends, and it makes us fall into the mind trap that holidays will make us gain weight.</p>
<p><em><strong>What happens next?</strong></em></p>
<p><img class="size-large wp-image-7158" src="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_215638387.jpeg?resize=1024%2C684&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="684" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_215638387.jpeg?resize=1024%2C684&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_215638387.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_215638387.jpeg?resize=768%2C513&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_215638387.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_215638387.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>We feel guilt .. and view exercise as “punishment” we “have” to get up and do the next day .. or as justification that if we burn a ton of calories pre-feast .. it’s okay to eat that extra serving of ice cream or calorie-filled cocktail.</p>
<p>Once you get this mentality, you will begin an endless (and very unhealthy) relationship with food. You will start to believe you ALWAYS have to earn food .. and will only feel okay about enjoying yourself .. if you have exercised.</p>
<p>Instead, look at your patriotic pump as a FREEDOM that you are blessed to have! You have an able body that GETS to move!!!</p>
<p>And view all that 4th of July food as FUEL! Getting in a workout before a big meal is a great way to rev up your metabolism and prepare your body to USE (instead of store) any extra calories you may consume!</p>
<p>Don’t fall into this food guilt trap<em>..</em>But also don’t go to the totally opposite end of the spectrum and make the holidays an excuse to be lazy and throw all your food mindfulness out the window! Use the short 15-minute workout  below and then ENJOY your day!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>Alright .. let’s get our PATRIOTIC PUMP ON!!</strong></em></p>
<p>Here is a quick fat blasting FOLLOW-ALONG cardio workout that won’t interfere with your day full of fun with friends and family!</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='1170' height='659' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/HzkBonK4kPQ?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The video above is a FOLLOW ALONG! Just press play and get to work! This fat-blasting workout consists of only 5 exercises. You will do each exercise for 40 seconds and take a quick 20-second break before moving on to the next exercise.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Explosive Squat with Calf Raises &#8211; 40 Seconds</strong><br />
<strong>Speed Skaters &#8211; 40 Seconds</strong><br />
<strong>High Knees &#8211; 40 Seconds</strong><br />
<strong>Alternating Toe Taps &#8211; 40 Seconds</strong><br />
<strong>Bicycles &#8211; 40 Seconds</strong></p>
<p>It only takes 15 minutes and can be done from home with NO EQUIPMENT! You don’t even need a mat or a timer! Since it’s a follow-along .. we’ve got everything taken care of for you!</p>
<p>Fill up your shaker with some <a href="https://sculptnation.com/products/pre-workout">Sculpt Nation PRE Workout</a> , and let’s get our Independence Day sweat on together… more calories burned means more BBQ to enjoy later, right?</p>

But like it or not, it is necessary for not only fat loss, but for overall health.</p>
<p><strong>WHAT IF</strong>…we told you that there is a way to make cardio SHORTER and at the same time MORE BENEFICIAL? Not only that but you do NOT need to spend endless hours pounding away on a treadmill to blast fat and help your heart? <strong>Sounds too good to be true … BUT IT’S NO</strong>T!</p>
<p>There really is a specific type of cardio that will get you in and out of the gym in 10-15 min tops and <strong>burns more calories than endless amounts of steady-state</strong>.</p>
<p>It’s called High-Intensity Interval Training or HIIT. Basically, you are doing cycles of short bursts of all-out intense exercise followed by short recovery periods.</p>
<p>The reason it works so well is that it not only burns calories while you are doing it, you experience something called the AFTERBURN EFFECT (EPOC.) In scientific terms, this is because of something called Excess Post Oxygen Consumption. To keep it simple for you, this basically just means your body continues to burn calories at an accelerated rate even after your workout is over.</p>
<p>How long will you continue to have that revved up metabolism resulting in more significant fat burn? Research is conflicting on this. Some say the afterburn effect lasts for up to 24 hours, while others believe that it only lasts for 2-3 hours. Either way, science seems to lean more toward HIIT when it comes to the afterburn effect because it requires more EPOC than a lower intensity steady state session. Some studies have calculated that this results in <strong>up to 15 percent more calories burned than traditional moderate-intensity exercises.</strong></p>
<p><strong>1 hour or 24 hours … if it helps us blast more fat in a shorter amount of time, we will take it!</strong></p>
<p>There are many ways you can create your own HIIT workouts. But if you don’t want to put much thought into it, one foolproof (and very effective) HIIT workout is simply hopping on a treadmill or a bike.</p>
<p><img class="size-large wp-image-6454" src="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/AdobeStock_205513720.jpeg?resize=1024%2C684&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="684" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/AdobeStock_205513720.jpeg?resize=1024%2C684&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/AdobeStock_205513720.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/AdobeStock_205513720.jpeg?resize=768%2C513&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/AdobeStock_205513720.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/AdobeStock_205513720.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" />Typically, you will work in cycles of short bursts of ALL OUT MAX EFFORT (80-90% of max heart rate) followed by short periods of rest (until your heart rate drops to between 40- 50% of your max heart rate.)<br />
If you are doing the high intervals at the right pace, you will NEED every second of recovery that follows.</p>
<p><strong>The keyword to remember with this type of cardio … ALL OUT.</strong></p>
<p>You can not give this type of cardio half effort and see optimal results. If you are not giving those HIGH INTERVALS your all (we are talking 80-90% of your max heart rate ) then you probably are better off sticking with steady-state.</p>
<p><strong>HOW DO YOU KNOW YOUR MAX HEART RATE?!</strong><br />
Here is an easy formula to calculate your personal Max Heart Rate.<br />
<strong>220 &#8211; your age = your max heart rate</strong><br />
<em>*For example, that means if you’re 35 years old, you subtract 35 from 220 to arrive at the fastest your heart should beat: 185 beats per minute. This can vary slightly from person to person based on their fitness level*</em></p>
<p>There are many different high/low cycles that you can use for HIIT. Depending on your fitness level and what exercises you choose to do, you may need to lower the duration of your HIGH interval times and/or lengthen the REST times.</p>
<p><strong>Some examples of interval cycle times could be:</strong><br />
10 seconds on &#8211; 20 seconds off<br />
20 seconds on &#8211; 20-40 seconds off<br />
30 seconds on &#8211; 30-90 seconds off</p>
<p>Anything longer than 30 seconds for the HIGH interval and you likely will not be going ALL OUT, which will make it more of a MIIT workout (moderate intensity interval training.)</p>
<p>To give you an idea of how HIIT is done, Vince did a video showing us his favorite HIIT workout. He also shows us a different method for determining your HIGH INTERVAL speed that doesn’t involve calculating heart rate.</p>
<p>The bottom line with HIIT … <strong>WORK HARD when it’s time to work and RECOVER when it’s time to rest.</strong> In this video, Vince is going to show you the BEST cardio workout for fat loss. This workout is great for anyone looking to lose weight, reduce stomach fat, or get absolutely shredded.</p>
<p>Following this routine style will make your cardio routine only 10-15 minutes max and burn more calories than standard steady-state ever could! For this workout, we&#8217;re going to need a treadmill and a bike, and we&#8217;ll be doing 5 rounds on each. Get ready to sweat!</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='1170' height='659' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/EYCmu3UtJno?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></p>
<p><strong>Exercise #1: Treadmill</strong><br />
20 Second MAX Intensity<br />
Rest 20 Seconds<br />
Repeat 5 Rounds</p>
<p><strong>Exercise #2: Bike</strong><br />
30 Second MAX Intensity<br />
Slow Pace for 30 Seconds<br />
Repeat 5 Rounds</p>
<p>As with any workout, you want to maximize your time. <strong>Don’t just train harder, train smarter!!</strong> Want to make the metabolic disruption caused by your workouts last all day long?</p>
<p>Imagine how much faster you’d burn fat if you could spike your metabolism and keep your body’s fat-burning potential going near non-stop. You can, but you need high-powered thermogenic help. <strong><a href="https://sculptnation.com/burn-lf/">BURN</a></strong> <strong>to the rescue (the belly-fat buster) <a href="https://sculptnation.com/burn-lf/">Click Here to hunt down and destroy every last belly fat cell.</a></strong></p>

<p>Make sure you are picking exercises from this list that CHALLENGE YOU! If you discover that your heart-rate doesn’t get as high with one exercise vs. another, try a different one the next time!</p>
<p><strong>If you aren’t sure how to perform some of these movements, we have a video demonstrating proper form and describing each one in detail!</strong></p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='1170' height='659' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/st9RSk7K3YM?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></p>
<p>Are HIIT workouts easy … <strong>NO!</strong></p>
<p>Are they effective … <strong>YES!</strong></p>
<p>If you have never done HIIT, you may see how hard they are, and be tempted to go back to those boring steady-state sessions, but we challenge you to create your own program and give it a go! As time passes, you will still be gasping for air, but it will become more familiar!</p>
<p><strong>In case you need some more reasons why HIIT may be your new GO-TO CARDIO?!</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>NO EQUIPMENT OR GYM NEEDED:<br />
</strong>If you don’t have gym access or any equipment on hand, as we showed you in the workout examples abo e, there are DOZENS of bodyweight-only exercises you can do from anywhere.</li>
<li><strong>TIME EFFICIENT:</strong><br />
These workouts take a FRACTION of the time that steady-state takes. HIIT typically lasts NO MORE than 20-30 min, and most typically 10-15 min. Some researchers have found that you can make more progress doing only 15 minutes of HIIT vs. pounding the pavement for an hour.</li>
<li><strong>BURN MORE CALORIES:</strong><br />
In addition to blasting calories while your cardio is in session, because of something called EPOC (Excess Post Oxygen Consumption) &#8211; your body burns fat for HOURS after interval training.</li>
<li><strong>BURN FAT NOT MUSCLE:</strong><br />
Studies show that both HIIT CARDIO can preserve muscle mass while still ridding the body of excess fat.</li>
<li><strong>INCREASED METABOLISM:</strong><br />
Some studies have found that HIIT stimulates the production of Human Growth Hormone (HGH) by up to 450 percent during the 24 hours after you finish HIIT.</li>
<li><strong>IT IS NOT TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE</strong><br />
You can burn more fat and calories when you work out for less time instead of more. The only trade-off is that you do have to work as hard as you possibly can during the HIGH interval periods, or you won’t get the results you’re looking for.</li>
</ul>
<p>There is a way to super-potentiate the power of your HIIT workouts and drive your metabolic rate through the roof all day long. In fact, in less than 30-seconds a day, you can prime your body to burn more calories, <strong>pull fat from your cells, then torch it before it has a chance to resettle somewhere else on your body.</strong> This is how you get rapid results… and keep them forever. <a href="https://sculptnation.com/burn/"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Click Here to Discover How (results guaranteed)</strong></span></a></p>

<h3><strong>Gym Gear</strong></h3>

<h3>16. Yoga Mat</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-5768 size-full" src="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/person-rolling-green-gym-mat-gift-ideas-px.jpg?resize=625%2C400&#038;ssl=1" alt="Yoga Mat | Cool Gift Ideas for Fitness Enthusiast" width="625" height="400" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/person-rolling-green-gym-mat-gift-ideas-px.jpg?w=625&amp;ssl=1 625w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/person-rolling-green-gym-mat-gift-ideas-px.jpg?resize=300%2C192&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>

<h3>18. Face Towel Set</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-5769 size-full" src="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Morning-exercises-and-refreshment-concept-gift-ideas-ss.jpg?resize=625%2C400&#038;ssl=1" alt="Face Towel Set | Cool Gift Ideas for Fitness Enthusiast" width="625" height="400" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Morning-exercises-and-refreshment-concept-gift-ideas-ss.jpg?w=625&amp;ssl=1 625w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Morning-exercises-and-refreshment-concept-gift-ideas-ss.jpg?resize=300%2C192&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>Sometimes the best fitness gifts to give are the simple yet practical items your friend can use on a daily basis.</p>
<p>For example, a set of face towels is affordable yet very useful. Your friend will surely appreciate functional workout gifts like these.</p>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> To add more sentimental value to it, you can personalize the towels by having a tailor stitch your friend’s name on it.</p>
<p>Also, choose a set that contains an array of colors. Imagine how boring it’d be if you gave your friend a 10-piece face towel set that all have the same colors.</p>

<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-5771 size-full" src="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Man-tying-jogging-shoes-gift-ideas-ss.jpg?resize=625%2C400&#038;ssl=1" alt="Running Shoes | Cool Gift Ideas for Fitness Enthusiast" width="625" height="400" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Man-tying-jogging-shoes-gift-ideas-ss.jpg?w=625&amp;ssl=1 625w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Man-tying-jogging-shoes-gift-ideas-ss.jpg?resize=300%2C192&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>Is your pal an avid runner? Then one of the best workout gift ideas would be a new pair of running shoes.</p>
<p>Get a sturdy pair made especially for running. Your friend will definitely appreciate the soft bounce and light feeling of a good pair of running shoes.</p>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> Sprinters and marathoners use different pairs. Make sure to determine beforehand which one they are.</p>
<h3>23. Dri-Fit Shirt</h3>
<p>One struggle gym-goers have is not having enough workout clothes to wear. Laundry day just can’t keep up with the amount of workouts gym buffs have in a single week.</p>
<p>One of the coolest gifts for fitness freaks would be a few pairs of sweat-repelling dri-fit shirts. Grab a few in different colors and give them to your workout buddy.</p>
<p>That way, they won’t have to worry about not having enough workout clothes for the week.</p>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> These types of gifts don’t necessarily have to be expensive. It’s more practical to buy multiple pairs of affordable shirts than a single expensive one.</p>
<h3>24. Fruit Blender</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-5772 size-full" src="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Mid-section-of-a-woman-preparing-fruit-smoothie-in-blender-gift-ideas-ss.jpg?resize=625%2C400&#038;ssl=1" alt="Fruit Blender | Cool Gift Ideas for Fitness Enthusiast" width="625" height="400" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Mid-section-of-a-woman-preparing-fruit-smoothie-in-blender-gift-ideas-ss.jpg?w=625&amp;ssl=1 625w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Mid-section-of-a-woman-preparing-fruit-smoothie-in-blender-gift-ideas-ss.jpg?resize=300%2C192&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>This coming holiday season, give your loved ones the gifts of health –a fruit blender. It’s a simple kitchen appliance fitness buffs can use to create their pre- and post-workout shakes.</p>
<p>Plus, it might be the motivation they need to cut out sugary drinks from their diet. Instead of opening a can of soda, your friends can use the blender you gave them to pulse a <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/healthy-protein-shake-recipes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">delicious, healthy fruit smoothie</a>.</p>
<h3>25. Stopwatch</h3>
<p>Gym-goers know how frustrating it is to keep checking the phone every time you clock a workout. But with a stopwatch, they can focus on performing their workout routine without having to consistently check the time.</p>
<p>It’s one of the perfect active gift ideas for fitness buffs who do running, circuit training, and calisthenics, among others.</p>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> If you’re hosting a party this holiday season, a stopwatch should definitely be one of the fitness prizes you give away. It’s both affordable and practical.</p>
<h3>26. Jump Rope</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-5773 size-full" src="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/man-and-woman-skipping-with-jump-rope-outdoors-gift-ideas-ss.jpg?resize=625%2C400&#038;ssl=1" alt="Jump Rope | Cool Gift Ideas for Fitness Enthusiast" width="625" height="400" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/man-and-woman-skipping-with-jump-rope-outdoors-gift-ideas-ss.jpg?w=625&amp;ssl=1 625w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/man-and-woman-skipping-with-jump-rope-outdoors-gift-ideas-ss.jpg?resize=300%2C192&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>Give your workout buddy the ability to do HIIT exercises wherever they are. Jump rope exercises are great workouts that help lower your overall body fat.</p>
<p>Plus, it doesn’t take up too much luggage space. As such, your friend can take it with them wherever they go.</p>
<h3>27. Adjustable Dumbbells</h3>
<p>The main struggle with gifting dumbbells is the user may outgrow them in just a few months. At the same time, it’s not really practical to buy your friend multiple pairs of dumbbells.</p>
<p>Luckily, you only need to buy a single pair of adjustable dumbbells your gym buddy can use forever.</p>
<p>These are space-saving dumbbells you can adjust to match the weight you want. Most systems can go from 5lbs. to 50lbs. with just one click.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Get ripped in 90 days! Watch the video below:</strong></p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='1170' height='659' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/VgYyT5iir4w?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></p>
<p>These are just some of the best holiday presents for your fellow fitness enthusiasts. Don’t be afraid to think outside the box when coming up with gift ideas. Take time to analyze exactly what your buddy needs. Think of something they can use all year round. The last thing you’d want to give is a seasonal item that provides no functional use.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you wanna lose that belly fat and get ripped six pack abs, you don&#8217;t need to hire an expensive personal trainer or go to the gym. All you need to do is get a dumbbell and follow these workout routines!</p>
<h2>Weighted Ab Workout For A Ripped Six Pack Abs</h2>
<h3></h3>
<h3>Start With Your Gut</h3>
<p><!-- instagram error: invalid instagram resource --></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">When it comes to getting ripped six pack abs, there’s one thing you should not overlook. Diet. So before you try this workout, if you’re not sure <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/healthy-eating-mistakes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">what you should be eating</a> in order to really chisel your abs, take my free body type quiz to learn the 3 most important things to do to see results.</span></p>
<div>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://vshred.com/sp/survey/survey-aka1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="s1">Click Here To Take The Free Body Type Quiz!</span></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Once your <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/healthy-eating-mistakes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">dietary concerns</a> are out of the way, it’s time to train those abs! Abs are just like any other muscle group, but smaller than most. That means you need to train them and let them recover just like any other muscle. So we recommend doing this weighted ab workout no more than every other day making sure to allow your abdominal muscles to recover completely.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">All you will need for this workout is a single dumbbell. You may pick the weight of your choice or use no weight at all (this depends on your physical capability) and do as follows:</span></p>
<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1">The Workout</span></h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There are four total exercises and for each exercise, you will do 4 sets of 10-15 reps with only 20 seconds of rest in-between. If you cannot handle this layout, you may extend your rest period slightly or break the sets into “mini sets” but make sure to complete the same total number of reps.</span></p>
<h3><span class="s1">Dumbbell Straight-Arm Crunches</span></h3>
<p><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/3ksxlaN8sLsKFMri0P"><img src="https://i0.wp.com/media.giphy.com/media/3ksxlaN8sLsKFMri0P/giphy.gif?resize=480%2C270&#038;ssl=1" alt="Animated GIF - Find &amp; Share on GIPHY" width="480" height="270" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In this abs routine, you’re going to lay flat on your back with your knees bent. Hold the dumbbell out straight above you and continue to push the dumbbell straight towards the ceiling as you crunch.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">4 sets of 10-15 reps. </span></p>
<h3><span class="s1">Dumbbell Reverse Crunches</span></h3>
<p><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/B1SY1kmjV1yVAJcbpJ"><img src="https://i2.wp.com/media.giphy.com/media/B1SY1kmjV1yVAJcbpJ/giphy.gif?resize=480%2C270&#038;ssl=1" alt="Animated GIF - Find &amp; Share on GIPHY" width="480" height="270" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Lay flat on your back again for this one but this time, place a dumbbell between your feet with your knees completely bent and thighs pointing straight up. Hold on to the dumbbell with your feet and bring your legs up toward your chest making sure your lower back gets off the ground. Focus on using your abs to pull your legs up and not getting momentum from your knees or feet. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">4 sets of 10-15 reps.</span></p>
<h3><span class="s1">Rotating Mountain Climbers</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For this one, get into a regular push-up position. Now, similar to mountain climbers, you will be driving your knees upward but will also do a twist as you do so. So you drive your knees to your opposite elbow as you twist your core.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">4 sets of 10-15 reps each way.</span></p>
<h3><span class="s1">Dumbbell Woodchops</span></h3>
<p><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/uANrWMqcPO9s62VFoZ"><img src="https://i0.wp.com/media.giphy.com/media/uANrWMqcPO9s62VFoZ/giphy.gif?resize=480%2C270&#038;ssl=1" alt="Animated GIF - Find &amp; Share on GIPHY" width="480" height="270" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Stand with a single dumbbell held by both hands and start off by turning your shoulders completely to one side, keeping the dumbbell low. Rotate your shoulders to the opposite side as you raise the dumbbell up high above your head in the process. Focus on engaging your core with the twists.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">4 sets of 10-15 each way.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">These core exercises, </span>as well as other <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/workout-plans-weight-loss/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">fat burning workouts</a>,<span style="font-size: 1rem;">will h</span>elp you get six pack abs and lead a healthier, more active life.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Get rid of belly fat fast with these practical and effective tips you can follow today.</p>
<h2>17 Effective Tips to Get Rid of Belly Fat Fast</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>1. Do More HIIT Exercises</h3>
<p><!-- instagram error: invalid instagram resource --></p>
<p>Does running burn belly fat? The answer: yes. Running and other cardiovascular activities are great exercises to burn belly fat.</p>
<p>One of the best ways how to burn belly fat is to incorporate some cardio routines into your workout plan. But keep in mind not every cardio movement is ideal for bodybuilding purposes.</p>
<p>Instead of running 5 km/h on a treadmill, opt to do quick, explosive sprints. High-intensity interval exercises tend to burn both fat and muscle mass.</p>
<p>If you want to maintain a fit, strong, and sexy body, you need to do quick, explosive <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/hiit-workout-plan-burn-calories-in-4-minutes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HIIT workouts</a> that burn stubborn belly fat and build lean muscle mass at the same time.</p>
<h3>2. Ditch the Junk</h3>
<p>Potato chips, fries, chocolate bars, and fizzy drinks are just some of the junk you need to cut out from your diet if you want to burn belly fat fast.</p>
<p>These junk foods are high in calories and offer zero nutritional value. There’s no way to reduce belly fat without at least cutting back on these junk.</p>
<p>But if you can’t completely remove these foods from your diet, don’t worry! The next best way to lose stomach fat is to replace these snacks with healthier options.</p>
<p>For example, instead of eating a bag of potato crisps, make your own zucchini chips instead. Search for healthy food options you can use to replace your common daily snacks.</p>
<h3>3. Drink More Water</h3>
<p>Whether your goal is to lose belly fat, build muscle, or improve athletic strength, it’s very important to stay hydrated 24/7.</p>
<p>Drinking water is a solid way to remove toxins from your body. If these toxins pile up in your body, losing belly fat will be the least of your problems.</p>
<p>Too many toxins in the body may lead to constipation, bloating, and even certain diseases. Aim to drink 8 to 10 glasses of water for optimal performance.</p>
<h3>4. Make Healthier Food Choices</h3>
<p>Doing the best exercises to burn belly fat is not enough to trim down your waistline. Remember: you sculpt muscles in the gym and lose fat in the kitchen.</p>
<p>The best way to burn belly fat is to combine regular core exercises with a healthy, well-balanced diet. All your hard work at the gym won’t mean anything if you don’t feed your muscles with the right nutrients.</p>
<p>Some of the foods that burn belly fat include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Almonds</li>
<li>Berries</li>
<li>Fatty Fish</li>
<li>Eggs</li>
<li>Chili Peppers</li>
<li>Veggies</li>
<li>Oranges</li>
<li>Avocado</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> These are just some of the belly-fat-burners men and women can eat. Feel free to explore other natural food choices. Overall, it’s best to avoid artificially sourced snacks and foods. Stick to natural, healthy, and nutritious options.</p>
<h3>5. Cut Back on Carbs</h3>
<p>Many seasoned fitness buffs swear that the best way to burn belly fat is to cut back on carbs –and it’s true!</p>
<p>The body only burns about 6% to 8% of calories per gram of carbs. Meanwhile, the body burns 25% to 30% of calories per gram of protein.</p>
<p>That means you cut back on around 41 grams of calories if you eat 50 grams of protein instead of carbs. Keep this in mind while you’re making your personal diet plan to follow.</p>
<p>Opt to source your energy from alternative nutrients such as healthy fats, minerals, and of course, protein.</p>
<p><strong>Important:</strong> You don&#8217;t have to completely cut carbs from your diet. In fact, you need to know the best times of the day to <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/best-times-eat-carbs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">eat your carbs</a>.</p>
<h3>6. Start Meal Prepping</h3>
<p><!-- instagram error: invalid instagram resource --></p>
<p>One reason people forego eating healthy is because organic products usually cost more than artificially sourced foods do. That’s because organic food choices have a much shorter shelf life.</p>
<p>As a result, companies can’t produce too much stock since a lot of it might simply go to waste. However, there is a way to eat healthy, natural choices without denting your pocket: <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/how-to-meal-prep-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">meal prepping</a>.</p>
<p>It’s the best way to lose belly fat through healthy dieting without spending too much money on natural and organic food brands. The main point is to prepare your meals hours or even days ahead of time.</p>
<p>Do your grocery shopping, set aside a few hours to cook your meals, and then refrigerate them. This’ll also force you to forego eating junk food since you already have your packed meals with you.</p>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> Don’t worry if you don’t have a knack for cooking. Opt to follow V Shred’s <a href="https://vshred.com/sp/recipe-guide/v1/?ref=programs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">healthy recipe guide</a>. It consists of multiple delicious, healthy, easy-to-follow recipes any fitness buff can follow.</p>
<h3>7. Lay Off the Booze</h3>
<p>It’s no secret that an effective way how to burn belly fat for men and women is to cut back on alcoholic drinks.</p>
<p>A single bottle of beer already has around 150 calories. Count how many bottles you chug on a typical Friday night and multiply it by 150; that’s how many calories you consume during a night out.</p>
<p>You don’t have to completely abstain from booze. In fact, some studies suggest that a few occasional drinks may even be good for the health.</p>
<p>But what you should do is stop binge drinking every single weekend. It adds inches to your waist and kills your gains.</p>
<h3>8. Ditch the Salad Dressing</h3>
<p>Plenty of fitness buffs who want to get rid of belly fat choose to eat salads. But keep in mind that this healthy choice means nothing if you’re topping it with calorie-filled pre-packaged salad dressings.</p>
<p>The best way how to lose belly fat fast with salads is to top it off with vinaigrette dressing instead. Apart from having lesser calories, acidic fluids stimulate the fat-burning process.</p>
<p>Plus, they help remove water weight, constipation, and bloating. If you want to achieve a lean, shredded six-pack try to include vinegar into your diet.</p>
<h3>9. Start Keeping Track of Your Calories</h3>
<p>We cannot stress how important it is to keep track of your calories when dieting. To lose some pounds, you need to start calculating exactly how much you eat.</p>
<p>If you want to get rid of belly fat fast, you have to decrease your daily calorie intake. At the same time, you need to increase the number of calories you burn every day.</p>
<p>The average male needs to eat 1,500 calories if they want to drop their body fat percentage. Meanwhile, women can only consume 1,000 calories per day if they want to trim a few inches off their waist.</p>
<h3>10. Do Various Abdominal Exercises</h3>
<p>Crunches are good ab exercises, but they’re not the only workouts you need to do. Your ab-sculpting regimen should consist of different moves that hit your torso from all different angles.</p>
<p>Try to incorporate exercises that hit your lower, middle, and upper abs respectively. For example, if you’re looking for moves on how to lose fat in your<a href="https://vshred.com/blog/how-to-lose-lower-belly-fat/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> lower abs</a>, you can opt to bust out some hanging leg raises.</p>
<p>Overall, what’s important is to create a complete abs workout with different moves and exercises to sculpt your torso from all angles.</p>
<h3>11. Start Lifting Weights</h3>
<p>Running on your gym’s treadmill for hours on end is not the best way how to burn belly fat. If you want to sculpt a strong, solid core, you need to start doing some resistance training.</p>
<p>It’s very important to include <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/strength-training/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">compound strength-training moves</a> such as the bench press, deadlift, and squat into your regimen.</p>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> Even if your main goal is to get rid of belly fat, it’s not practical to do ab exercises every single day of the week. Like any other muscle group, you only need to work your abs out around two to three times a week.</p>
<h3>12. Lower Your Stress Levels</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-5445 size-full" src="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/man-doing-yoga-on-mat-near-glass-balcony-fence-get-rid-of-belly-fat-px.jpg?resize=625%2C400&#038;ssl=1" alt="Lower Your Stress Levels | The Most Effective Ways to Get Rid of Belly Fat Fast" width="625" height="400" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/man-doing-yoga-on-mat-near-glass-balcony-fence-get-rid-of-belly-fat-px.jpg?w=625&amp;ssl=1 625w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/man-doing-yoga-on-mat-near-glass-balcony-fence-get-rid-of-belly-fat-px.jpg?resize=300%2C192&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>If you want to get rid of belly fat, make sure to be mindful of the stress you put on yourself.</p>
<p>You may not notice it, but stress has a negative effect on both your mind and body. Apart from the strain it places on your mental health, it also promotes the production of the stress hormone, cortisol.</p>
<p>High cortisol levels tend to increase your appetite and stimulate the storage of fat in your abdomen. Women should especially be careful of their stress levels since they already have high amounts of cortisol.</p>
<p>To reduce your stress, try engaging in mentally and spiritually relaxing activities such as yoga, stretching, and meditation. Doing these simple, short activities are a great way to lower your stress levels.</p>
<h3>13. Move Around More Often</h3>
<p>Simple movements such as taking the stairs, walking around the office, and stretching every few hours can go a long way in helping you get rid of belly fat.</p>
<p>Sedentary people tend to accumulate more fat in their belly. Plus, their muscles don’t get sufficient blood and oxygen to recover properly.</p>
<p>What you can do is to stand up from your desk for a few minutes after every couple of hours of work. If you have the time, you can try to squeeze in some <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/abs-workout-home/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">quick abdominal workouts</a> during your lunch break.</p>
<p>Remember: the key here is to get the blood flowing and muscles moving as much as you can. It doesn’t matter when or where.</p>
<h3>14. Start Keeping Track of Your Record</h3>
<p>A solid way how to lose belly fat is to force yourself beyond your comfort zone. You can do this by keeping track of your personal record when performing different exercises to burn belly fat.</p>
<p>For example, if you usually cover five kilometers in 30 minutes, try to ramp it up by challenging yourself to cover the same distance faster. Similarly, you can opt to increase the reps of your burpees, crunches, or sit-ups every month or so.</p>
<p>This is effective because the body naturally adapts to the level of stress we put on it. After a few weeks, it won’t be as difficult to bust out 20 burpees anymore.</p>
<p>Variation ensures your body doesn’t adapt too quickly to the exercises you regularly perform. This means you’re constantly challenging your body to work harder and stronger every time you work out.</p>
<h3>15. Do Resistance Training Before Cardio</h3>
<p>Many fitness buffs struggle whether they should perform cardio before or after a workout. If your goal is to get rid of belly fat fast, then opt to perform it after you do resistance training.</p>
<p>This’ll help you focus all your strength on lifting more sets of heavy weights. At the same time, your body will have a harder time doing your cardio routine since you’re already tired.</p>
<p>Doing so will force your body to work twice as hard during your cardio session even if you’re doing your regular routine.</p>
<h3>16. Follow a Scientifically Proven Plan</h3>
<p>Remember that there’s no one-size-fits-all plan on how to <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/get-six-pack/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reduce belly fat</a>.</p>
<p>You can opt to create your own abs regimen by gathering the different core exercises online. Similarly, you can subscribe to a brand that offers a fitness plan consisting of the most effective tips and exercises on how to lose stomach fat.</p>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> If you want to know the secret how to burn belly fat fast, get V Shred’s <a href="https://vshred.com/sp/six-pack-shred/v1/?ref=programs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Six-Pack Shred</a> program. It’s a scientifically proven fitness plan that helps dedicated gym-goers sculpt a strong, shredded six-pack in just a few weeks.</p>
<h3>17. Just Do It</h3>

<h2>5-Move Leg Day Regimen | Hardcore Full Leg Workout Routine</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>1. Barbell Squats</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-5256 size-full" src="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Barbell-Squats-full-leg-workout.jpg?resize=625%2C349&#038;ssl=1" alt="Barbell Squats | V Shred's Ultimate Full Leg Workout" width="625" height="349" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Barbell-Squats-full-leg-workout.jpg?w=625&amp;ssl=1 625w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Barbell-Squats-full-leg-workout.jpg?resize=300%2C168&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><strong>Reps</strong>: 20</p>
<p><strong>Sets:</strong> 3</p>
<p><strong>Muscles Worked:</strong> Quads, glutes</p>
<p>Our full leg workout routine starts off with some <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/how-to-do-squats-exercises-for-knee-pain/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">barbell squats</a>. They’re a strength-training movement that works the whole body with an emphasis on your quads and glutes.</p>
<p>The number one thing to remember when squatting is proper form. Remember: the quality of your reps will always outweigh the volume or quantity.</p>
<ul>
<li>Place a loaded bar across your traps, position your feet shoulder-width apart, point your toes forward, and arch your hips out. This will be your starting position.</li>
<li>With your hips coming down first, lower your body until your knees bend at a 90-degree angle. Remember to keep all the weight on your heels and to push your chest out as your body descends.</li>
<li>From here, push your body back up using your leg muscles. This counts as one rep.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> You don’t necessarily need to go ass to grass when squatting. Going further than a 90-degree bend will put an unnecessary strain on your back.</p>
<h3>2. Leg Press</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-5257 size-full" src="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Leg-Press-full-leg-workout.jpg?resize=625%2C349&#038;ssl=1" alt="Leg Press | V Shred's Ultimate Full Leg Workout" width="625" height="349" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Leg-Press-full-leg-workout.jpg?w=625&amp;ssl=1 625w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Leg-Press-full-leg-workout.jpg?resize=300%2C168&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><strong>Reps:</strong> 20 to 30</p>
<p><strong>Sets:</strong> 5</p>
<p><strong>Muscles Worked:</strong> Outer quads, hamstrings</p>
<p>When doing leg presses, your goal should be to achieve a pump in your leg muscles. Do multiple reps of a weight you’re comfortable with to distribute sufficient blood and oxygen to the right muscle groups.</p>
<ul>
<li>Sit down on the leg press machine and prop your feet up on the platform in front of you. This is the optimal foot placement to target your outer quads.</li>
<li>Push the platform up using your legs. Remember not to fully straighten your legs. They should slightly bend to avoid leg injury.</li>
<li>Next, lower the weight down until your knees bend at a 90-degree angle. During this part, you’ll feel your outer quads and hamstrings contract.</li>
<li>Push the weight back up using your legs. Again, remember to not overextend your legs or lock them at the knees. This counts as one rep.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> Similar to barbell squats, you don’t necessarily need to go all the way down. Stop when your knees bend at a 90-degree angle to avoid straining your lower back.</p>
<h3>3. Walking Lunges</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-5258 size-full" src="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Walking-Lunges-full-leg-workout.jpg?resize=625%2C351&#038;ssl=1" alt="Walking Lunges | V Shred's Ultimate Full Leg Workout" width="625" height="351" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Walking-Lunges-full-leg-workout.jpg?w=625&amp;ssl=1 625w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Walking-Lunges-full-leg-workout.jpg?resize=300%2C168&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><strong>Reps:</strong> 10 each leg</p>
<p><strong>Sets:</strong> 5</p>
<p><strong>Muscles Worked:</strong> Quads</p>
<p>Walking lunges are a great addition to our killer leg workout routine. It’s a dynamic exercise that targets your quads every step of the way –literally.</p>
<ul>
<li>Place the bar across your traps, place your feet shoulder-width apart, and balance your entire weight on your heels. This will be your starting position.</li>
<li>Take a step forward with your left foot then lower your torso until your right knee almost touches the ground and your left thigh is parallel to the ground.</li>
<li>Lift yourself up by driving your heel to the ground then do the same with your other leg.</li>
<li>While doing walking lunges, keep the weight at the back, not the front. Also, push your chest out as you’re lunging.</li>
</ul>
<h3>4. Romanian Deadlifts</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-5259 size-full" src="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Romanian-Deadlifts-full-leg-workout.jpg?resize=625%2C353&#038;ssl=1" alt="Romanian Deadlifts | V Shred's Ultimate Full Leg Workout" width="625" height="353" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Romanian-Deadlifts-full-leg-workout.jpg?w=625&amp;ssl=1 625w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Romanian-Deadlifts-full-leg-workout.jpg?resize=300%2C169&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><strong>Reps:</strong> 15 to 20</p>
<p><strong>Sets:</strong> 3</p>
<p><strong>Muscles Worked:</strong> Hamstrings, glutes</p>
<p>Romanian deadlifts are great exercises to <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/hamstring-workouts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">strengthen your hamstrings</a>. You should feel the movement from the bottom of your legs to your glutes.</p>
<ul>
<li>Stand upright with a loaded barbell in front of you, arms at the sides, and feet shoulder-width apart.</li>
<li>Lift the weight up with a shoulder-width-apart grip and let it hang just below your pelvis. Next, slowly lower the weight down while keeping your legs stiff.</li>
<li>As you lower the weight, push your butt back as far as you can. The key here is to make full-range movements. Go all the way down and extend all the way up.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> Form is very important. Keep your hips in and chest out. Get one of them wrong and you might pull a muscle and injure yourself.</p>
<h3>5. Calves</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-5260 size-full" src="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Calves-full-leg-workout.jpg?resize=625%2C349&#038;ssl=1" alt="Calves | V Shred's Ultimate Full Leg Workout" width="625" height="349" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Calves-full-leg-workout.jpg?w=625&amp;ssl=1 625w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Calves-full-leg-workout.jpg?resize=300%2C168&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><strong>Reps:</strong> 20 to 40</p>
<p><strong>Sets:</strong>  3 to 5</p>
<p><strong>Muscles Worked:</strong> Calves</p>
<p>The main trick to growing your calf muscles is to do enough high-quality reps. That’s why we want to perform three to five sets of 20 to 40 reps per leg day.</p>
<ul>
<li>Sit down on the leg press machine and place your feet on the bottom part of the platform.</li>
<li>Only the balls of your feet should press against it. Your heels should be hanging off of it.</li>
<li>Push the weight up as if you are tiptoeing, using the balls of your feet, while keeping your legs straight in front of you. Lower it back down using the same muscles. This counts as one rep.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Tip</strong>: You can also do these leg workouts with dumbbells. Make sure that you feel the contraction in your calf muscles. In fact, it’s not about the weight, it’s more about muscle contraction.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Try this no-equipment workout plan to shed the fat from Thanksgiving&#8217;s feast.</p>
<h2>Complete Thanksgiving Day No-Equipment Workout Plan</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Step 1: Warm Up Your Muscles</h3>
<p><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/dty6dNBSDmVeAESCA5"><img src="https://i2.wp.com/media.giphy.com/media/dty6dNBSDmVeAESCA5/giphy.gif?resize=480%2C270&#038;ssl=1" alt="Animated GIF - Find &amp; Share on GIPHY" width="480" height="270" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>After a night of heavy eating and drinking, you’re bound to feel too lazy to move. But that’s nothing a little dynamic warm-up activity can’t fix.</p>
<p>First, jog in place for a few seconds to get your heart rate up. Next, do some jumping jacks for one minute. Then cap it off with some 45-second vertical jumps.</p>
<p>Do these three exercises three times before moving on to the workout. This will help warm your body up to prevent injuries and ensure peak athletic performance.</p>
<p>After warming up, take a few seconds to catch your breath. You’ll perform the next seven exercises continuously without resting.</p>
<h3>Step 2: Drop Some Squats</h3>
<p><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/OjY3mPQsw1lzPkGwSo"><img src="https://i1.wp.com/media.giphy.com/media/OjY3mPQsw1lzPkGwSo/giphy.gif?resize=480%2C270&#038;ssl=1" alt="Animated GIF - Find &amp; Share on GIPHY" width="480" height="270" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Reps:</strong> 15 to 30</p>
<p>The bodyweight squat is a great full-body workout that targets your quads and glutes. During this exercise, remember to distribute your bodyweight evenly to your heels.</p>
<p>Stand upright with your feet shoulder-width apart and arms straight in front of you. Push your butt back then lower your torso until your knees are parallel to the floor.</p>
<p>Squeeze your glutes for half a count then push your body back up by driving your heels to the ground. This counts as one rep.</p>
<h3>Step 3: Bust Out Some Push-Ups</h3>
<p><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/2jMD8FKw29bA9VWtUu"><img src="https://i0.wp.com/media.giphy.com/media/2jMD8FKw29bA9VWtUu/giphy.gif?resize=480%2C270&#038;ssl=1" alt="Animated GIF - Find &amp; Share on GIPHY" width="480" height="270" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Reps:</strong> 15 to 30</p>
<p>Push-ups are great exercises that promote overall upper body strength. They mainly work your pecs.</p>
<p>Go down to a full plank position. Place your hands slightly wider than your shoulders’ width. This will be your starting position.</p>
<p>Keeping your back straight, lower your body until your chest is only one to two inches away from the floor. Drive your hands to the ground to push your body back up. This counts as one rep.</p>
<h3>Step 4: Lunge Your Way to Better Legs</h3>
<p><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/1ncs4PsbrTdoKPdbQM"><img src="https://i0.wp.com/media.giphy.com/media/1ncs4PsbrTdoKPdbQM/giphy.gif?resize=480%2C270&#038;ssl=1" alt="Animated GIF - Find &amp; Share on GIPHY" width="480" height="270" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Reps:</strong> 15 to 30 each leg</p>
<p>Doing lunges is a great way to blast thigh fat and replace it with strong, lean leg muscles. Plus, it’ll help <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/glute-workouts-home-gym/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shape your butt</a>.</p>
<p>First, stand upright with your feet hip-width apart, arms at the sides, and eyes locked forward. Take a step forward with your left foot then bend both knees to lower your body.</p>
<p>Your right leg should almost touch the ground and your left knee should bend at 90 degrees. Push your body back up. This counts as one rep.</p>
<p>After one set, do it all over again with your other leg.</p>
<h3>Step 5: Balance Your Body With Single-Leg Deadlifts</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-5236 size-full" src="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Side-view-of-woman-runner-stretching-warm-up-with-single-leg-deadlift-no-equipment-workout-plan-ss.jpg?resize=625%2C400&#038;ssl=1" alt="Balance Your Body With Single-Leg Deadlifts | Workout Plan To Burn Off Those Thanksgiving Calories (Thanksgiving Day Workout Plan)" width="625" height="400" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Side-view-of-woman-runner-stretching-warm-up-with-single-leg-deadlift-no-equipment-workout-plan-ss.jpg?w=625&amp;ssl=1 625w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Side-view-of-woman-runner-stretching-warm-up-with-single-leg-deadlift-no-equipment-workout-plan-ss.jpg?resize=300%2C192&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><strong>Reps</strong>: 15 to 30</p>
<p>Doing this full body workout without weights is a solid way to exercise your leg muscles and abdominal stabilizer muscles at the same time.</p>
<p>Stand upright with your feet together and arms at the sides. Pull your left leg up behind you and balance yourself. This will be your starting position.</p>
<p>Lower your body by bending your right knee until your right hand touches the ground. Lift your body back up by driving your heel to the floor.</p>
<p>This counts as one rep. Perform 15 to 30 reps then do the same with your other leg.</p>
<h3>Step 6: Do the Shoulder Sculptor for Lean Arms</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-5237 size-full" src="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/biceps-triceps-fit-fitness-muscle-no-equipment-workout-plan-pb.jpg?resize=625%2C400&#038;ssl=1" alt="Do the Shoulder Sculptor for Lean Arms | Workout Plan To Burn Off Those Thanksgiving Calories (Thanksgiving Day Workout Plan)" width="625" height="400" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/biceps-triceps-fit-fitness-muscle-no-equipment-workout-plan-pb.jpg?w=625&amp;ssl=1 625w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/biceps-triceps-fit-fitness-muscle-no-equipment-workout-plan-pb.jpg?resize=300%2C192&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><strong>Reps:</strong> 15 to 30</p>
<p>The shoulder sculptor is an isolation exercise that <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/5-deltoid-exercises-to-strengthen-and-sculpt-your-shoulders/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">targets your deltoids</a>.</p>
<p>Stand upright and lift your arms straight in front of you parallel to the floor.</p>
<p>Next, pull your arms to the sides and bend your elbows at a 90-degree angle, about the same level as the top of your head.</p>
<p>From here, push your hands up toward the sky. This counts as one rep. Repeat everything in reverse.</p>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> To make this more challenging, use two cans of soups as your dumbbells. Make sure the two cans have the same weight.</p>
<h3>Step 7: Wall Sits for Stronger Legs</h3>

<p><strong>Reps:</strong> Hold for 1 minute</p>
<p>A great way to squat heavier is to strengthen your leg muscles through other exercises.</p>
<p>Wall sits are like planks for your leg muscles. You won’t be able to last long if you have a weak core and lower body.</p>
<p>Go into a squat position with your back pressing against the wall. Make sure your thighs are parallel to the floor. Hold this position for one minute.</p>
<h3>Step 8: Strengthen Your Triceps With Chair Dips</h3>

<p><strong>Reps:</strong> 15 to 30</p>
<p>The last exercise in our Thanksgiving Day workout circuit is the triceps chair dip. They’re essential to <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/bicep-workout-bigger-arms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">building solid, lean arms</a>.</p>
<p>Sit on the floor with a chair behind you. Lift your body up a bit then grab the edge of the chair with both your hands.</p>
<p>Extend your legs balancing yourself on your heels. Lift your body up by straightening your arms. This will be your starting position.</p>
<p>Lower your body by bending your elbows until they hit 90 degrees. Push down on the chair to lift your body back up to the starting position. This counts as one rep.</p>
<h3>Step 9: Active Rest</h3>
<p>After this, take three minutes of active rest –light jogging or brisk walking. Aim to go through the circuit three to four times.</p>
