That is a scary number!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Good thing you found this article because </span><b><i>we aren’t going to let YOU be “most” people! </i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lower temps do not have to equal larger waistlines! You just have to have a plan! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this short read we will &#8230;</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Explain why winter weight gain happens. Knowing why is important if you want to prevent it and the reason is probably not what you think. In fact, it is partially not even your fault!</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tell you why fall/winter is actually the BEST time to start a diet and training plan.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Give you 7 easy pro tips that will help guide you through the next few months. </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You may believe winter weight gain happens because of the holidays. Those extra home cooked meals and holiday parties are certainly a factor. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But </span><b><i>there is a DAILY issue you need to be prepared to fight </i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">if you want to avoid packing on winter pounds.</span></p>
<p><b>WHY YOU REALLY PACK ON POUNDS AFTER LABOR DAY</b></p>
<p><img class="size-large wp-image-7471" src="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_130930953.jpeg?resize=1024%2C512&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="512" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_130930953.jpeg?resize=1024%2C512&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_130930953.jpeg?resize=300%2C150&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_130930953.jpeg?resize=768%2C384&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_130930953.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_130930953.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the spring and summer months, you are given what we call a</span><b> fitness freebie. </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You get a </span><b><i>seasonal motivation boost</i></b> <span style="font-weight: 400;">that doesn’t happen when temperatures start to drop, and you begin to pull out the chunky sweaters and comfy leggings. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not only is the sun shining (which makes you happier because of Vitamin D), you are wearing LESS clothing in the summer months. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I don’t know about you, but knowing I’m going to be exposing more skin makes walking in the gym a little easier. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Covering up in layers, no doubt leads to the temptation to slack on body goals! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Knowing your arms, legs, and abs will be less exposed can easily be an excuse to slack. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, being layered up often means you don’t SEE the extra pounds, so they are easier to ignore.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But there is more to it than being bundled up….</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-7477" src="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_236518834.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_236518834.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_236518834.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_236518834.jpeg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_236518834.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_236518834.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span>The #1 reason you slack on health and fitness goals in colder months ISN’T EVEN YOUR FAULT!!</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, you have a part to play in all of this, but</span><b><i> there is actually a scientific reason why you have less desire to train and eat healthy when the sunshine of summer fades.</i></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We will explain why a little further down. But ya know what really stinks? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The scientific reason why we all experience these motivation slumps in the winter only adds to an even bigger issue with motivation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span>It doesn’t matter what season it is motivation ALWAYS comes and goes!</p>
<p>Spring, Summer, Fall, or Winter &#8211; you can NEVER rely on it!</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, what can you do when lack of sunshine and warm temps leave you even more tempted to hit snooze and reach for comfort foods? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You certainly don’t throw your hands up in the air and wait until January to make a resolution to crash diet to get your body ready for spring. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Believe it or not, RIGHT NOW is actually the IDEAL time to get started! </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you </span><b><i>START NOW, </i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">you will develop discipline and a routine heading into the holidays. This will put you in a great place mentally and physically to relax and “indulge” a little more at all those holiday gatherings! </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><b><i>Look at it this way ..<br />
</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Would you rather head into the holiday season already making progress toward your goals and be in a great spot <em>(where it would be okay even if you did gain an extra pound or two?)</em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Or would you rather put it off and only add more fat on top of what you want to lose?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The answer is clear— the solution to getting the motivation needed to make it happen, not so much.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But don’t worry! We’ve got ya covered</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (no pun intended)</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with a few easy motivation hacks!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><b>7 TIPS TO STAY MOTIVATED AS SEASONS CHANGE</b></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><b><br />
</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the number one questions we always get is … “<em>I am just not motivated. How can I motivate myself to train and eat better?”</em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As we mentioned earlier, it doesn&#8217;t matter what season it is, </span><b><i>you can’t always rely on motivation. </i></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you have it, great! You should certainly take advantage of it! But you have to know that it is totally normal to not have much of it. Even professional athletes lack motivation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You have to develop other daily habits that create discipline if you want to succeed long term!</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are a few of our pro tips that we use with our clients, specifically when temperatures drop, and motivation seems to be at its lowest! </span></p>
<p><b>TIP #1: Switch To An At Home Training Program</b></p>
<p><img class="size-large wp-image-7448" src="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_185038762.jpeg?resize=1024%2C647&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="647" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_185038762.jpeg?resize=1024%2C647&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_185038762.jpeg?resize=300%2C189&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_185038762.jpeg?resize=768%2C485&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_185038762.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_185038762.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you know that getting out of bed and stepping into the winter elements is going to be an excuse trigger, make a plan to train at home during cooler months! Some of the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">most effective and challenging workouts </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">only require your body weight and </span><b><i>maybe</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a set of dumbbells or some resistance bands.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A good fat-blasting, muscle-building sweat session can 100% be achieved from the comfort of your home!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adjustable dumbbells, ankle weights, resistance bands, a jump rope, etc., are all things that are inexpensive and can easily be stored in a closet or under your bed and pulled out anytime you don’t feel like leaving the house.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But if you have </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">the right training program</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><b><i>you don’t need any of that. </i></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our favorite </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">at-home bodyweight-only program</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is called</span><b> MOVE. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was designed to help you achieve your fitness goals without a single piece of equipment, and each workout is under 20 minutes! </span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Learn more about MOVE by watching the video below!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you need </span><b>a little extra “nudge”</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to get up and get moving, another </span><b>pro-tip we use</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is keeping some </span><a href="https://sculptnation.com/products/pre-workout" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><b>PRE WORKOUT </b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">on your bedside table. Have it already blended up and chug it as soon as your alarm goes off!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By the time you have brushed your teeth and put on your workout clothes, you will have a nice little jolt of energy and</span><b><i> tons of motivation</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to get going before you have a chance to come up with an excuse! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the bottom of this article, we will tell you about a big end of summer sale happening so that you can stock up on our </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">favorite </span><a href="https://sculptnation.com/products/pre-workout" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><b>PRE WORKOUT</b></a><strong> for 40% off when you use code: LABORDAY40 at checkout! </strong></p>
<p><b>TIP #2: Make Your Workouts Seasonal</b></p>
<p><img class="size-large wp-image-7452" src="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_65703942.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_65703942.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_65703942.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_65703942.jpeg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_65703942.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_65703942.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Embrace the change of seasons and take advantage of activities that you can only do in fall or winter! </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Go on a fall hike and view all the gorgeous foliage.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Try rock climbing.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Walk around a corn maze or pumpkin patch with your family. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you live in a snowy climate, go skiing, sledding, build snowmen with your kids, etc.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Go ice skating.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lace-up your sneakers, go for a walk or run at night, and admire all the Christmas lights and decorations.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are some things you can only do and see during specific times of the year. So instead of missing sunshine and water sports, focus on all the positive things that only come about with cooler temps!</span></p>
<p><b>TIP #3: Try Something Totally New</b></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-7454" src="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_361152601.jpeg?resize=1024%2C514&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="514" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_361152601.jpeg?resize=1024%2C514&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_361152601.jpeg?resize=300%2C151&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_361152601.jpeg?resize=768%2C386&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_361152601.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_361152601.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sometimes a change of routine is all you need to boost motivation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you have been doing all your gym lifts alone, recruit a gym buddy! Try switching up your cardio by skipping your solo runs and joining a group fitness class instead. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another option is to </span><b><i>allow yourself to slow down!</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> If you have been crushing it all spring and summer with intense training and hardcore workouts, </span><b><i>it may actually be time to take it down a notch. </i></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Going full force 365 can cause your stress hormone cortisol to increase. This can lead to a host of drawbacks, including weight gain, muscle loss, poor moods, fatigue, and occasional issues sleeping! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We aren’t saying you should become lazy! But if you have been crushing it 24/7 all spring and summer, your body (and mind) may need to slow down.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Use the next few months to embrace a slower routine. </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Commit to daily yoga.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Focus on becoming more flexible.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Switch to low or moderate-intensity cardio, instead of HIIT.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Try out some bodyweight workouts instead of heavy lifting.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Giving your body a couple of months to recover might even make you more responsive when you decide to kick things up again come spring/summer!</span></p>
<p><b>TIP #4: Stay Accountable</b></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-7457" src="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_266584820.jpeg?resize=1024%2C768&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="768" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_266584820.jpeg?resize=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_266584820.jpeg?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_266584820.jpeg?resize=768%2C576&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_266584820.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_266584820.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><b><br />
</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">The best way to stick to a plan is to have someone that you report back to. This could be a friend, family member, a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">social media community</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, or even a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">coach. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Including someone else, or even just telling someone else about your health and fitness goals and asking them to check in with you to make sure you are sticking to the plan, is a great way to keep the promises you make to yourself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you prefer to fly solo, it helps to create visuals. Make a vision board, create a daily checklist you can mark off after each workout, or keep an accomplishment journal.</span></p>
<p><b>TIP #5: Set A Spring Goal</b></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-7458" src="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_47332240.jpeg?resize=1024%2C680&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="680" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_47332240.jpeg?resize=1024%2C680&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_47332240.jpeg?resize=300%2C199&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_47332240.jpeg?resize=768%2C510&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_47332240.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_47332240.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">March may seem like a long time away, but it will be back before you know it, and 6 months is a long time to make significant changes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Setting a goal is a great way to encourage yourself to push past discomforts and temptation, but there is a science to goal setting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The key to creating goals that stick .. </span><b><i>be REALISTIC and SPECIFIC!</i></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s start with </span><b><i>reality. </i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">You should always focus on one goal at a time and make sure you are being honest with yourself if that goal is really attainable.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you know that your schedule will never allow you to work out 6 days a week, why would you choose a program that requires you to do that?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you know it’s not healthy to attempt to lose 10 pounds a week, why would you aim that high?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you love carbs, why would you go on a KETO diet? </span></p>
<p><b><i>Doing these things will essentially set yourself up for failure.</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Set attainable goals that fit YOUR lifestyle. You can always bump things up if your schedule allows, or you notice you aren’t pushing yourself hard enough. Just keep in mind that being realistic isn’t the same as not believing in yourself or making excuses. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moving on to being </span><b><i>specific.</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The more specific you are about your goals, the more likely you will be to reach them. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It may seem like it’s good enough to say things like .. I want to look good, lose weight, or get ripped! </span><b><i>But you have to dig deeper than that!! </i></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wanting to “lose weight,” for example, is an excellent place to start. But ask yourself what that means to you?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you expand on that and say &#8212; “I want to lose 10 pounds of fat. I will do this by not eating any sweets and doing the V Shred </span><a href="https://vshred.com/sp/move/soc-all/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><b>MOVE </b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">program for 30 consecutive days. I am doing this because I want to have better self-esteem and a head start on bikini season.” &#8212; that makes your goal more specific.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The more specific (and attainable) your goals are, the more likely you will be to not give up!</span></p>
<p><b>TIP #6: Reward Yourself</b></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-7459" src="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/vin_sant_32048508_366936073798151_433609263865135104_n.jpg?resize=882%2C1024&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="882" height="1024" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/vin_sant_32048508_366936073798151_433609263865135104_n.jpg?resize=882%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 882w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/vin_sant_32048508_366936073798151_433609263865135104_n.jpg?resize=258%2C300&amp;ssl=1 258w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/vin_sant_32048508_366936073798151_433609263865135104_n.jpg?resize=768%2C892&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/vin_sant_32048508_366936073798151_433609263865135104_n.jpg?w=1080&amp;ssl=1 1080w" sizes="(max-width: 882px) 100vw, 882px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you have checked a “mini goal” off your list, treat yourself. Knowing that you have a reward coming to celebrate your efforts will make you want to achieve it even more. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It may be tempting to make your reward one of your favorite “forbidden foods” but we never suggest that you reward yourself this way.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You aren’t a dog. You should never reward “good behavior” with food. Having this mentality can create a really unhealthy relationship with food.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You need to eat healthy MOST of the time, control your portions, and see food as fuel. But if you are craving something that isn’t quite as healthy as your grilled chicken and rice, never feel like you need to lose 20 pounds to “deserve” a bite of cake, or nice dinner out with your family. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instead of rewarding yourself with food, buy yourself something you have been wanting. Maybe some new workout clothes, a massage, or an extra $20 bucks in your vacation fund! </span></p>

<p><b>TIP #7: Make Mental Health Top Priority</b></p>
<p><img class="size-large wp-image-7460" src="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_255894146.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_255894146.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_255894146.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_255894146.jpeg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_255894146.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_255894146.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Earlier, we mentioned that cold weather motivation dips may not be your fault.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’m sure you have heard of winter blues. Well, it’s a real thing. Less natural light can cause dips in serotonin, the neurotransmitter that regulates mood.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The dark and dreary days of winter can also cause your body to produce more of the sleep hormone melatonin. This shift can disrupt your body and impact your sleep patterns and overall mood.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are a few ways that you can focus on improving your mental health.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Invest in a light therapy box that simulates natural daylight.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Make sure you are supplementing with or eating plenty of foods with Vitamin D.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Start journaling. There is a lot of scientific evidence that supports putting your thoughts on paper provides a long list of benefits, including stress management, self-confidence, and goal setting. </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Suppose you still find yourself struggling with negative seasonal motivation shifts. In that case, you may need to experiment with taking</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> naturally sourced herbs</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to help support brain health and a positive mood.</span></p>
<p><b><i>Here are a few with some great scientific backing to help boost mood.</i></b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>EnXtra: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">A natural caffeine-free patent-pending botanical ingredient that has been shown to help increase dopamine levels.**It is also one of the first and only natural caffeine-free patent-pending botanical ingredients shown to boost mental alertness &amp; acuity for hours or ending in a huge caffeine energy crash.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Piper Nigrum Fruit Extract:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> A very specific type of black pepper that has been shown to help increase both serotonin and dopamine.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>L-Theanine:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> A powerful amino acid that is believed to help reduce occasional anxiety brought on by stressful situations.</span></li>
</ul>

<p><b><i>BOTTOM LINE IF YOU WANT TO STAY MOTIVATED YEAR ROUND</i></b><b><i><br />
</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you put away the shorts and swimsuits and shift out of bikini season, it’s common for motivation to “fall back” with the clocks. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The seasons have to change (unless you live near the equator) &#8211; so you have to figure out ways to</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">not let your fitness goals go into hibernation mode!</span><b><i> </i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pumpkin spice lattes are only here for a limited time, but getting into shape isn’t seasonal! </span><i>It&#8217;s a year-round commitment!!</i><i> </i></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>IT band stretches can help relieve pain when there is an inflammation of the muscles surrounding the IT band. Too much running and other rapid activities can increase tension in the IT band, which causes pain in the hip or knees. To relieve the pain, you have to stretch the muscles around your IT band. Additionally, strengthening the hip will also help balance the muscles surrounding the IT band, which will also decrease tension. Here are some IT band hip pain stretches you can try to relieve the pain caused by tightness in the IT band.</p>
<h2>7 Must-Try IT Band Stretches for Tight Hips</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>1. The Basic Stretch</h3>
<p>One of the easiest IT band stretches you can try is the basic stretch. All you need to do is stand straight as you cross your right leg over your left leg.</p>
<ol>
<li>Start leaning to the right side towards your front leg. Once you feel the stretch on your left leg, you&#8217;ll know that you&#8217;re doing it correctly.</li>
<li>Hold this position for about 30 seconds.</li>
<li>After this, you can switch the position of your legs and again, hold for 30 seconds.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> Do these IT band stretches 5-10 times while deeply breathing. You&#8217;ll know these are working fine once you feel an actual stretch in your leg muscles.</p>
<h3>2. Wall Stretch</h3>
<p>Stand at an arm&#8217;s distance from the wall. Be sure the wall you&#8217;ll be leaning on is sturdy enough to avoid losing balance while doing this stretch.</p>
<ol>
<li>Put your feet together. Put your left arm against the wall.</li>
<li>Place your right arm on your hip.</li>
<li>Without moving your feet and hips, move your left hip towards the wall.</li>
<li>Hold for 30 seconds then switch sides.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> Be sure to squeeze your glutes when moving towards the wall.</p>
<h3>3. Cross-Body Stretch</h3>
<p>In doing the cross-body stretch, you&#8217;ll need an exercise band. To do this, you have to lie down facing up.</p>
<ol>
<li>Move your left leg up as you wrap the strap over the ball 0f your foot. Make sure to flex both of your feet while doing this.</li>
<li>Try to pull the strap as you slowly drag your left leg to the right side. Your hips must be touching the floor as you work on the strap.</li>
<li>Hold this position for 30 seconds then switch sides.</li>
</ol>

<h3>4. Clamshell Hip Stretch</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-3902 size-full" src="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/beautiful-girl-sportswear-looking-camera-smiling-IT-Band-Stretches-ss.jpg?resize=625%2C417&#038;ssl=1" alt="Clamshell Hip Stretch | IT Band Stretches For Tight Hips | it band hip pain stretches" width="625" height="417" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/beautiful-girl-sportswear-looking-camera-smiling-IT-Band-Stretches-ss.jpg?w=625&amp;ssl=1 625w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/beautiful-girl-sportswear-looking-camera-smiling-IT-Band-Stretches-ss.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<ol>
<li>Lie on your left side and place an exercise band around your legs. Pull it up so it will be just above the knees.</li>
<li>Next, bend your knees slightly, one leg on top of the other. Make sure your heels are in line with your spine. The goal is to lift your top knee with the exercise bands on and make it parallel with your hips.</li>
<li>Repeat the open-close movements of your knees and do these for 15 times.</li>
<li>Switch sides after finishing the set.</li>
</ol>
<h3>5. Forward Fold Stretch</h3>
<ol>
<li>Stand tall and place your dominant leg over your other leg.</li>
<li>Keep your feet as close as you can and start bending forward, keeping your back flat and knees slightly bent. Try to reach the floor with your hands as you bend your knees a little more.</li>
<li>Gently reach the right side while keeping your forward fold position.</li>
<li>Hold this for 30 seconds and place your hands back to the center and slowly stand up.</li>
<li>Do these over again and reach your left side.</li>
</ol>
<h3>6. Stretching with Foam Rollers</h3>
<p>After using the exercise band for your IT band stretches, it&#8217;s now time to learn stretching with foam rollers.</p>
<ol>
<li>To do this stretch, you have to place the foam roller on the floor and sit on it with your left leg crossed over your right knee.</li>
<li>Place your left ankle on your right leg as you put your hands behind your back for support. Slowly slide the <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/foam-rolling-exercises-mistakes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">foam roller</a> forward and backward while keeping your position.</li>
<li>After 30 seconds of doing this, switch sides.</li>
<li>For the second part, lie down with your front hips touching the foam roller.</li>
<li>Place your right hip under the foam roller and start rolling in this position for about 30 seconds.</li>
<li>Do the same with your left hips.</li>
</ol>
<h3>7. Band Walk</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-3901 size-full" src="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/squatting-beauty-girl-do-exercises-stadium-IT-Band-Stretches-ss.jpg?resize=625%2C434&#038;ssl=1" alt="Band Walk | IT Band Stretches For Tight Hips | it band syndrome symptoms" width="625" height="434" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/squatting-beauty-girl-do-exercises-stadium-IT-Band-Stretches-ss.jpg?w=625&amp;ssl=1 625w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/squatting-beauty-girl-do-exercises-stadium-IT-Band-Stretches-ss.jpg?resize=300%2C208&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>Let&#8217;s now go to another challenging stretch for your IT band. Grab an exercise band that can support your thighs and legs.</p>
<ol>
<li>Place the band above your knees and do a semi-squat position.</li>
<li>Lean a little bit forward as you carry your chest and put your arms on your sides without touching your body.</li>
<li>Start shifting your hips by taking a small step using your right leg and then your left leg. Try to walk slowly with the bands on as you push your hips back.</li>
<li>Walk 20 steps to the right then do the same to the left.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Try out the iliotibial band stretches above and you&#8217;ll feel how your hip muscles strengthen after a few sets. These can also relieve IT band syndrome symptoms. If you think your pain or other symptoms are worsening, be sure to visit a doctor to prevent further damage to your IT band. We hope this guide has helped you understand more about it and the stretches you can do to strengthen your hip muscles and relieve pain caused by too much tension to the IT band.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Did you know foam rolling exercises help rehabilitate the muscles after an intense workout? It&#8217;s a manual therapy you can do to ease the soreness and improve muscle circulation. However, we need to address some of the common foam rolling mistakes people do. With that said, let&#8217;s talk about getting most of the foam rolling benefits and breaking up those scar tissue build up over the years.</p>
<h2>3 Biggest Mistakes When Doing Foam Rolling Exercises</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span style="color: #000080;">Mistake #1. Going Way Too Fast</span></h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-1807 size-full" src="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/foam-rolling-2.jpg?resize=627%2C419&#038;ssl=1" alt="Going Way Too Fast | Foam Rolling Exercises You Should NEVER Do | foam rolling benefits" width="627" height="419" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/foam-rolling-2.jpg?w=627&amp;ssl=1 627w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/foam-rolling-2.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 627px) 100vw, 627px" data-recalc-dims="1" /><br />
One of the most common foam-rolling mistakes is going too fast. The first tip is to slow down and ease up. Going fast is basically rolling back and forth on the foam roller.</p>
<p>It doesn&#8217;t create enough pressure in a single spot to break a scar tissue. The idea is to slow it down and concentrate on specific parts. Find those trigger points, sit on it, but not for too long.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span style="color: #000080;">Mistake #2. Sitting on a Specific Spot for Too Long</span></h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-1808 size-full" src="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/foam-roller-1.jpg?resize=625%2C352&#038;ssl=1" alt="Sitting on a Specific Spot for Too Long | Foam Rolling Exercises You Should NEVER Do | foam rolling for knee pain" width="625" height="352" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/foam-roller-1.jpg?w=625&amp;ssl=1 625w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/foam-roller-1.jpg?resize=300%2C169&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px" data-recalc-dims="1" /><br />
You can sit on a specific spot for 30 seconds in a minute but refrain from going beyond that. It&#8217;s not a good idea to extend the time and do it for about 5 or 10 minutes.</p>
<p>Doing this will put you at risk of injuring your tissues or nerves. It may even cause more long-term negative effects on the targeted spot. This mistake will just eliminate the reason why you should foam roll.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span style="color: #000080;">Mistake #3. Foam-rolling on the Wrong Body Spot</span></h3>
<p>Be careful of which spot exactly you are foam rolling. Let&#8217;s take for example foam rolling for <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/how-to-do-squats-exercises-for-knee-pain/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">knee pain</a>. There are many reasons for having knee pain and one of them is due to the IT band (Iliotibial Band) being extremely tight.</p>
<p>This is the band that runs on the upper leg connecting to the knee. So when you have knee pain due to tightening of the IT band, you would think of foam rolling this part of your body. This is not how it is supposed to be.</p>
<p>The IT band inserts to the glutes so you&#8217;d rather hit this part than where the actual IT band runs. Roll out your TFL (Tensor Fasciae Latae) as well.</p>
<p>Rolling out these areas instead of the actual spot where you feel the pain will help loosen up your muscles and relieve the soreness. It&#8217;s not always the smartest to roll out the spot that has the most pain.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Watch this video to get a visual of how people are actually making mistakes in foam rolling:</strong><br />
<iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='1170' height='659' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/bsTa51Vr5VI?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe><br />
All this is about the proper way to do foam rolling exercises. Always make it a point not to do the exercise too fast. This will only go by the affected muscle without achieving anything at all. The three key points are to go slow, don&#8217;t sit too long in the same spot, and hit the spot that&#8217;s creating the pain. Taking note of these will help you benefit more from the exercise. This will also improve your flexibility and maximize your workouts minus the pain.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Why is it important to perform lower back pain exercises before any type of workout? Back pain is commonly associated with an anterior tilt of the pelvis due to long periods of sitting.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s troublesome to go through all your workout routines when at the same time, you&#8217;re experiencing discomfort in your back. With that said, you need to loosen up the areas of your body that surrounds the pelvic positioning.</p>
<p>Remember, it is always important to consult with a doctor first and foremost if you&#8217;re experiencing back pain. Read on to check out a few exercises for lower back pain relief that work for me.</p>
<h2>Lower Back Pain Exercises to Loosen Up the Pelvis Area</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span style="color: #000080;">1. Exercise for Thoracic Spine Mobility</span></h3>
<p><iframe class="giphy-embed" src="https://giphy.com/embed/uWB1kCKuXY5IQxNKmV" width="480" height="270" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>Lie down on your back and make sure the lower back is flat on the ground. Lift one leg up bringing it to 90 degrees, then drop it across your body to one side.</p>
<p>Bring your knee all the way to the floor and hold it with your outer hand. From this position, reach back with your opposite shoulder to get that nice stretch. Do the same thing to the other side of the body.</p>

<p>The quadratus lumborum is the muscle running down the middle of your back. Start with your back on the ground, bring your knees to your chest and pull it in as hard as you can.</p>
<p>Take a deep breath then exhale through your mouth as hard as you can. Get your lower back into a curve to stretch the quadratus lumborum muscle. Do this for two to three sets and hold for 20 to 30 seconds.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #000080;">3. Psoas Stretch</span></h3>
<p><iframe class="giphy-embed" src="https://giphy.com/embed/8lVLwgFkRsU0TQ31HD" width="480" height="270" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>The psoas is the muscle under your obliques. From a sitting position, put one leg out in front at a 90-degree angle from your hips slightly bent at the knee.</p>
<p>Put the other leg directly to the side maintaining that 90-degree angle. Stretch one shoulder as far away from the back knee and implement a slight twist to get as much stretch as possible. Switch legs and do the same exercise for the other side of your body.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #000080;">4. TFL Foam Roll Action</span></h3>
<p><iframe class="giphy-embed" src="https://giphy.com/embed/1xlKMxtv1ZojDwQagM" width="480" height="270" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>The TFL (Tensor Fascia Latae) is a muscle of the thigh about halfway between your glutes and the front of your leg. Start the exercise by lying directly on the side of your hips.</p>
<p>Find a tender spot outside of that bony ridge of the hips and deeply sit in it. Doing this will break up that tissue to start loosening the muscle. Perform this exercise on the other side as well.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #000080;">5. Quads Foam Roll</span></h3>
<p><iframe class="giphy-embed" src="https://giphy.com/embed/8P7qCC6von0YcTIkW8" width="480" height="270" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>The quads are always bent and in hip flexion. When you&#8217;re always in a hip hinge, the quad muscles are going to be tight. Loosening up the quad muscles will also allow the pelvis to go back to pelvic neutral.</p>
<p>This will start to level back out so that the back muscles are no longer pinching. Find the tender spot on all four quad muscles and sit on them as you foam roll. The four quad muscles are vastus lateralis, vastus medialis, vastus intermedius, and rectus femoris.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #000080;">6. Deep Quads and Psoas Stretch</span></h3>
<p><iframe class="giphy-embed" src="https://giphy.com/embed/2rAKLPouWb45ukU0y1" width="480" height="270" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>Put your foot back behind you bending your knee on the ground. Try to get a deep stretch on your quad as possible.</p>
<p>After this, move into an upright position to get your shoulders directly above your hips. Over emphasize posteriorly tilting your pelvis so that you&#8217;re not in an anterior tilt.</p>
<p>This way, you&#8217;re stretching out your psoas and quads as much as possible. Flex your glutes to give the best stretch on your psoas muscle and quads. Do this for both sides of your body.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #000080;">7. Diaphragmatic Breathing</span></h3>
<p><iframe class="giphy-embed" src="https://giphy.com/embed/LWGHS1bDK5KJ23aPi6" width="480" height="270" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>Begin with both your knees and hands on the ground. Drop your butt back to get a good stretch.</p>
<p>Try to push the back of your butt and the tips of your fingers as far away from each other as possible. The next thing to do is come up on all fours with knees and hands to the ground.</p>
<p>Over emphasize rolling your shoulders outwards to create as much space between your shoulder and your neck. Make sure your back is straight and breathe out through your mouth tucking the pelvis as much as you can.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #000080;">8. Diaphragmatic Breathing Out to the Side</span></h3>
<p><iframe class="giphy-embed" src="https://giphy.com/embed/c6Vu2WUcZ1Yl6D5ZUr" width="480" height="270" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>Get on all fours with knees and hands to the ground. Make sure your pelvis is in a neutral position with your back straight.</p>
<p>Take one arm off the ground and point your elbow directly down. With your hand at the side of your head, open up your elbow and shoulder to get as much of a stretch in <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/full-lower-body-6-pack-abs-workout-bodyweight-exercises-only/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">your lower lat</a>. Do this in 5 to 10 reps on 3 to 4 sets.</p>

<h2 class="p1">Exercises for Knee Pain</h2>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">There’s no doubt that squatting can hurt your joints. Whether that be your low back or your knee, if you’re not doing the squats right, or preparing before-hand, you’re probably experiencing some of that pain first hand. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Luckily, there lots of exercises for knee pain. And today, I’m going to walk you through the simple 5 step process that I love doing. This will help you avoid any knee pain when it comes to squatting!</span></p>
<h3 class="p5">The Exercises:</h3>
<p class="p5"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>1. Warm up your legs first</strong></span></p>
<p class="p5">By warming up your legs, all that is needed is to simply get on some kind of low impact cardio machine.</p>
<p class="p5">Something that will start getting your leg muscles working. Machines such as the bicycle, stair master, elliptical, or even walking on an incline are great.</p>
<p class="p5">Do one for about 5 minutes and it will drastically improve how loose and flexible your legs feel.</p>
<p class="p5"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>2. Roll out your leg muscles</strong></span></p>
<p class="p5">Foam rolling is huge when it comes to any muscle group, but is especially important for legs, seeing as how it’s the largest muscle group in the body and we’re walking around on them all day.</p>
<p class="p5">Foam rolling for 5-10 minutes will help to increase your circulation, increase flexibility/mobility and prep your muscles for the workout that&#8217;s about to go down.</p>
<p class="p5"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>3. Open up your hips</strong></span></p>
<p class="p5">Opening up your hips is especially important for those that are sitting at a desk all day.</p>
<p class="p5">Naturally, as we sit, the muscles in and around our hips are becoming increasingly tighter and less mobile. This is one of the main reasons why people feel they can not go very deep in their squat.</p>
<p class="p5">By doing a couple exercises, such as internal and external hip rotations, the prayer squat and the frog, you can relieve some of the tightness in your hips allowing for a further range of motion and better stimulation of the correct muscle groups.</p>
<p class="p5"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>4. Pre-stimulate your glutes</strong></span></p>
<p class="p5">Activating your glute muscle before start any leg workout is one of the most overlooked aspects of leg training. Also, it is one of my favorite exercises for knee pain EVER.</p>
<p class="p5">Typically, people find it much easier to work their quad muscles rather than they hamstrings and glutes. This is due to the fact that they’re not spending any time creating that mind/muscle connection.</p>
<p class="p5">Grabbing a band and putting it around your knees and doing some side step squats or some hip abductors until you feel a contraction in your booty, can go a long way in preventing knee or back pain with squats because you’ll be using the right muscles to push that weight.</p>
<p class="p5"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>5. Warm up with light weight</strong></span></p>
<p class="p5">Warming up with lighter weight than normal takes a lot of patience but can make all the difference in your very first session trying it.</p>
<p class="p5">Doing this will allow your joints to secrete synovial fluid into the joint cavity of your knees. This helps to lubricate the articulating joints and reduce friction while squatting.</p>
<p class="p5">Simply doing two sets of 15 reps with super light weight (maybe even just body weight) can help increase that lubrication and make a huge difference in your legs feel when loading up on weight.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p5">So try these easy exercises for knee pain before your next squat session and see if it helps! I grew up a volleyball player. So when it comes to figuring out how to do squats without knee pain, this has been my go-to for years. This helps me avoid knee pain! Let me know your story down below!</p>
