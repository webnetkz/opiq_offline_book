That is a scary number!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Good thing you found this article because </span><b><i>we aren’t going to let YOU be “most” people! </i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lower temps do not have to equal larger waistlines! You just have to have a plan! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this short read we will &#8230;</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Explain why winter weight gain happens. Knowing why is important if you want to prevent it and the reason is probably not what you think. In fact, it is partially not even your fault!</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tell you why fall/winter is actually the BEST time to start a diet and training plan.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Give you 7 easy pro tips that will help guide you through the next few months. </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You may believe winter weight gain happens because of the holidays. Those extra home cooked meals and holiday parties are certainly a factor. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But </span><b><i>there is a DAILY issue you need to be prepared to fight </i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">if you want to avoid packing on winter pounds.</span></p>
<p><b>WHY YOU REALLY PACK ON POUNDS AFTER LABOR DAY</b></p>
<p><img class="size-large wp-image-7471" src="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_130930953.jpeg?resize=1024%2C512&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="512" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_130930953.jpeg?resize=1024%2C512&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_130930953.jpeg?resize=300%2C150&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_130930953.jpeg?resize=768%2C384&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_130930953.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_130930953.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the spring and summer months, you are given what we call a</span><b> fitness freebie. </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You get a </span><b><i>seasonal motivation boost</i></b> <span style="font-weight: 400;">that doesn’t happen when temperatures start to drop, and you begin to pull out the chunky sweaters and comfy leggings. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not only is the sun shining (which makes you happier because of Vitamin D), you are wearing LESS clothing in the summer months. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I don’t know about you, but knowing I’m going to be exposing more skin makes walking in the gym a little easier. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Covering up in layers, no doubt leads to the temptation to slack on body goals! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Knowing your arms, legs, and abs will be less exposed can easily be an excuse to slack. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, being layered up often means you don’t SEE the extra pounds, so they are easier to ignore.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But there is more to it than being bundled up….</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-7477" src="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_236518834.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_236518834.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_236518834.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_236518834.jpeg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_236518834.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_236518834.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span>The #1 reason you slack on health and fitness goals in colder months ISN’T EVEN YOUR FAULT!!</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, you have a part to play in all of this, but</span><b><i> there is actually a scientific reason why you have less desire to train and eat healthy when the sunshine of summer fades.</i></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We will explain why a little further down. But ya know what really stinks? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The scientific reason why we all experience these motivation slumps in the winter only adds to an even bigger issue with motivation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span>It doesn’t matter what season it is motivation ALWAYS comes and goes!</p>
<p>Spring, Summer, Fall, or Winter &#8211; you can NEVER rely on it!</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, what can you do when lack of sunshine and warm temps leave you even more tempted to hit snooze and reach for comfort foods? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You certainly don’t throw your hands up in the air and wait until January to make a resolution to crash diet to get your body ready for spring. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Believe it or not, RIGHT NOW is actually the IDEAL time to get started! </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you </span><b><i>START NOW, </i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">you will develop discipline and a routine heading into the holidays. This will put you in a great place mentally and physically to relax and “indulge” a little more at all those holiday gatherings! </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><b><i>Look at it this way ..<br />
</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Would you rather head into the holiday season already making progress toward your goals and be in a great spot <em>(where it would be okay even if you did gain an extra pound or two?)</em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Or would you rather put it off and only add more fat on top of what you want to lose?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The answer is clear— the solution to getting the motivation needed to make it happen, not so much.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But don’t worry! We’ve got ya covered</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (no pun intended)</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with a few easy motivation hacks!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><b>7 TIPS TO STAY MOTIVATED AS SEASONS CHANGE</b></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><b><br />
</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the number one questions we always get is … “<em>I am just not motivated. How can I motivate myself to train and eat better?”</em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As we mentioned earlier, it doesn&#8217;t matter what season it is, </span><b><i>you can’t always rely on motivation. </i></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you have it, great! You should certainly take advantage of it! But you have to know that it is totally normal to not have much of it. Even professional athletes lack motivation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You have to develop other daily habits that create discipline if you want to succeed long term!</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are a few of our pro tips that we use with our clients, specifically when temperatures drop, and motivation seems to be at its lowest! </span></p>
<p><b>TIP #1: Switch To An At Home Training Program</b></p>
<p><img class="size-large wp-image-7448" src="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_185038762.jpeg?resize=1024%2C647&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="647" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_185038762.jpeg?resize=1024%2C647&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_185038762.jpeg?resize=300%2C189&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_185038762.jpeg?resize=768%2C485&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_185038762.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_185038762.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you know that getting out of bed and stepping into the winter elements is going to be an excuse trigger, make a plan to train at home during cooler months! Some of the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">most effective and challenging workouts </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">only require your body weight and </span><b><i>maybe</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a set of dumbbells or some resistance bands.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A good fat-blasting, muscle-building sweat session can 100% be achieved from the comfort of your home!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adjustable dumbbells, ankle weights, resistance bands, a jump rope, etc., are all things that are inexpensive and can easily be stored in a closet or under your bed and pulled out anytime you don’t feel like leaving the house.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But if you have </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">the right training program</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><b><i>you don’t need any of that. </i></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our favorite </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">at-home bodyweight-only program</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is called</span><b> MOVE. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was designed to help you achieve your fitness goals without a single piece of equipment, and each workout is under 20 minutes! </span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Learn more about MOVE by watching the video below!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you need </span><b>a little extra “nudge”</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to get up and get moving, another </span><b>pro-tip we use</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is keeping some </span><a href="https://sculptnation.com/products/pre-workout" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><b>PRE WORKOUT </b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">on your bedside table. Have it already blended up and chug it as soon as your alarm goes off!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By the time you have brushed your teeth and put on your workout clothes, you will have a nice little jolt of energy and</span><b><i> tons of motivation</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to get going before you have a chance to come up with an excuse! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the bottom of this article, we will tell you about a big end of summer sale happening so that you can stock up on our </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">favorite </span><a href="https://sculptnation.com/products/pre-workout" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><b>PRE WORKOUT</b></a><strong> for 40% off when you use code: LABORDAY40 at checkout! </strong></p>
<p><b>TIP #2: Make Your Workouts Seasonal</b></p>
<p><img class="size-large wp-image-7452" src="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_65703942.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_65703942.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_65703942.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_65703942.jpeg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_65703942.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_65703942.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Embrace the change of seasons and take advantage of activities that you can only do in fall or winter! </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Go on a fall hike and view all the gorgeous foliage.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Try rock climbing.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Walk around a corn maze or pumpkin patch with your family. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you live in a snowy climate, go skiing, sledding, build snowmen with your kids, etc.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Go ice skating.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lace-up your sneakers, go for a walk or run at night, and admire all the Christmas lights and decorations.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are some things you can only do and see during specific times of the year. So instead of missing sunshine and water sports, focus on all the positive things that only come about with cooler temps!</span></p>
<p><b>TIP #3: Try Something Totally New</b></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-7454" src="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_361152601.jpeg?resize=1024%2C514&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="514" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_361152601.jpeg?resize=1024%2C514&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_361152601.jpeg?resize=300%2C151&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_361152601.jpeg?resize=768%2C386&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_361152601.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_361152601.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sometimes a change of routine is all you need to boost motivation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you have been doing all your gym lifts alone, recruit a gym buddy! Try switching up your cardio by skipping your solo runs and joining a group fitness class instead. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another option is to </span><b><i>allow yourself to slow down!</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> If you have been crushing it all spring and summer with intense training and hardcore workouts, </span><b><i>it may actually be time to take it down a notch. </i></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Going full force 365 can cause your stress hormone cortisol to increase. This can lead to a host of drawbacks, including weight gain, muscle loss, poor moods, fatigue, and occasional issues sleeping! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We aren’t saying you should become lazy! But if you have been crushing it 24/7 all spring and summer, your body (and mind) may need to slow down.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Use the next few months to embrace a slower routine. </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Commit to daily yoga.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Focus on becoming more flexible.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Switch to low or moderate-intensity cardio, instead of HIIT.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Try out some bodyweight workouts instead of heavy lifting.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Giving your body a couple of months to recover might even make you more responsive when you decide to kick things up again come spring/summer!</span></p>
<p><b>TIP #4: Stay Accountable</b></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-7457" src="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_266584820.jpeg?resize=1024%2C768&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="768" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_266584820.jpeg?resize=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_266584820.jpeg?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_266584820.jpeg?resize=768%2C576&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_266584820.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_266584820.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><b><br />
</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">The best way to stick to a plan is to have someone that you report back to. This could be a friend, family member, a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">social media community</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, or even a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">coach. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Including someone else, or even just telling someone else about your health and fitness goals and asking them to check in with you to make sure you are sticking to the plan, is a great way to keep the promises you make to yourself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you prefer to fly solo, it helps to create visuals. Make a vision board, create a daily checklist you can mark off after each workout, or keep an accomplishment journal.</span></p>
<p><b>TIP #5: Set A Spring Goal</b></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-7458" src="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_47332240.jpeg?resize=1024%2C680&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="680" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_47332240.jpeg?resize=1024%2C680&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_47332240.jpeg?resize=300%2C199&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_47332240.jpeg?resize=768%2C510&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_47332240.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_47332240.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">March may seem like a long time away, but it will be back before you know it, and 6 months is a long time to make significant changes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Setting a goal is a great way to encourage yourself to push past discomforts and temptation, but there is a science to goal setting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The key to creating goals that stick .. </span><b><i>be REALISTIC and SPECIFIC!</i></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s start with </span><b><i>reality. </i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">You should always focus on one goal at a time and make sure you are being honest with yourself if that goal is really attainable.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you know that your schedule will never allow you to work out 6 days a week, why would you choose a program that requires you to do that?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you know it’s not healthy to attempt to lose 10 pounds a week, why would you aim that high?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you love carbs, why would you go on a KETO diet? </span></p>
<p><b><i>Doing these things will essentially set yourself up for failure.</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Set attainable goals that fit YOUR lifestyle. You can always bump things up if your schedule allows, or you notice you aren’t pushing yourself hard enough. Just keep in mind that being realistic isn’t the same as not believing in yourself or making excuses. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moving on to being </span><b><i>specific.</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The more specific you are about your goals, the more likely you will be to reach them. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It may seem like it’s good enough to say things like .. I want to look good, lose weight, or get ripped! </span><b><i>But you have to dig deeper than that!! </i></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wanting to “lose weight,” for example, is an excellent place to start. But ask yourself what that means to you?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you expand on that and say &#8212; “I want to lose 10 pounds of fat. I will do this by not eating any sweets and doing the V Shred </span><a href="https://vshred.com/sp/move/soc-all/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><b>MOVE </b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">program for 30 consecutive days. I am doing this because I want to have better self-esteem and a head start on bikini season.” &#8212; that makes your goal more specific.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The more specific (and attainable) your goals are, the more likely you will be to not give up!</span></p>
<p><b>TIP #6: Reward Yourself</b></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-7459" src="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/vin_sant_32048508_366936073798151_433609263865135104_n.jpg?resize=882%2C1024&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="882" height="1024" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/vin_sant_32048508_366936073798151_433609263865135104_n.jpg?resize=882%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 882w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/vin_sant_32048508_366936073798151_433609263865135104_n.jpg?resize=258%2C300&amp;ssl=1 258w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/vin_sant_32048508_366936073798151_433609263865135104_n.jpg?resize=768%2C892&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/vin_sant_32048508_366936073798151_433609263865135104_n.jpg?w=1080&amp;ssl=1 1080w" sizes="(max-width: 882px) 100vw, 882px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you have checked a “mini goal” off your list, treat yourself. Knowing that you have a reward coming to celebrate your efforts will make you want to achieve it even more. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It may be tempting to make your reward one of your favorite “forbidden foods” but we never suggest that you reward yourself this way.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You aren’t a dog. You should never reward “good behavior” with food. Having this mentality can create a really unhealthy relationship with food.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You need to eat healthy MOST of the time, control your portions, and see food as fuel. But if you are craving something that isn’t quite as healthy as your grilled chicken and rice, never feel like you need to lose 20 pounds to “deserve” a bite of cake, or nice dinner out with your family. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instead of rewarding yourself with food, buy yourself something you have been wanting. Maybe some new workout clothes, a massage, or an extra $20 bucks in your vacation fund! </span></p>

<p><b>TIP #7: Make Mental Health Top Priority</b></p>
<p><img class="size-large wp-image-7460" src="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_255894146.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_255894146.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_255894146.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_255894146.jpeg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_255894146.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_255894146.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Earlier, we mentioned that cold weather motivation dips may not be your fault.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’m sure you have heard of winter blues. Well, it’s a real thing. Less natural light can cause dips in serotonin, the neurotransmitter that regulates mood.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The dark and dreary days of winter can also cause your body to produce more of the sleep hormone melatonin. This shift can disrupt your body and impact your sleep patterns and overall mood.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are a few ways that you can focus on improving your mental health.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Invest in a light therapy box that simulates natural daylight.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Make sure you are supplementing with or eating plenty of foods with Vitamin D.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Start journaling. There is a lot of scientific evidence that supports putting your thoughts on paper provides a long list of benefits, including stress management, self-confidence, and goal setting. </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Suppose you still find yourself struggling with negative seasonal motivation shifts. In that case, you may need to experiment with taking</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> naturally sourced herbs</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to help support brain health and a positive mood.</span></p>
<p><b><i>Here are a few with some great scientific backing to help boost mood.</i></b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>EnXtra: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">A natural caffeine-free patent-pending botanical ingredient that has been shown to help increase dopamine levels.**It is also one of the first and only natural caffeine-free patent-pending botanical ingredients shown to boost mental alertness &amp; acuity for hours or ending in a huge caffeine energy crash.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Piper Nigrum Fruit Extract:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> A very specific type of black pepper that has been shown to help increase both serotonin and dopamine.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>L-Theanine:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> A powerful amino acid that is believed to help reduce occasional anxiety brought on by stressful situations.</span></li>
</ul>

<p><b><i>BOTTOM LINE IF YOU WANT TO STAY MOTIVATED YEAR ROUND</i></b><b><i><br />
</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you put away the shorts and swimsuits and shift out of bikini season, it’s common for motivation to “fall back” with the clocks. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The seasons have to change (unless you live near the equator) &#8211; so you have to figure out ways to</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">not let your fitness goals go into hibernation mode!</span><b><i> </i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pumpkin spice lattes are only here for a limited time, but getting into shape isn’t seasonal! </span><i>It&#8217;s a year-round commitment!!</i><i> </i></p>

<p>It is that time of year!! 4th of July is upon us!!</p>
<p>Burgers on the grill … fireworks in the sky … and for many .. an excuse to skip the gym and eat thousands of calories .. in one sitting!</p>
<p>It can be tempting to throw your diet and training mindset out the window when holidays come around. But you must treat holidays just like you would any other day.</p>
<p>Have fun .. enjoy the time with family … and even enjoy all the food .. but keep your goals in mind. One of the best things you can do .. is still get in a solid workout!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>We’ve got the perfect 4th of July PRE PARTY PUMP!</strong></em></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-7322" src="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_8006.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_8006.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_8006.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_8006.jpeg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_8006.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>The workout we&#8217;re giving you below will not only burn a ton of calories .. the endorphins released from this short HIIT workout will boost your mood .. which will help you keep your healthy food habits in mind when it’s time to fire up the grill!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>We will never tell you that you need to “earn” your calories .. that is not the kind of relationship with food we promote here at V Shred &amp; Sculpt Nation.</strong></em></p>
<p>Food should never be seen as “the enemy” or “a reward” .. and exercise should never be viewed as punishment.</p>
<p>Diet culture makes us feel bad about having a nice dinner with friends, and it makes us fall into the mind trap that holidays will make us gain weight.</p>
<p><em><strong>What happens next?</strong></em></p>
<p><img class="size-large wp-image-7158" src="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_215638387.jpeg?resize=1024%2C684&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="684" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_215638387.jpeg?resize=1024%2C684&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_215638387.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_215638387.jpeg?resize=768%2C513&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_215638387.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_215638387.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>We feel guilt .. and view exercise as “punishment” we “have” to get up and do the next day .. or as justification that if we burn a ton of calories pre-feast .. it’s okay to eat that extra serving of ice cream or calorie-filled cocktail.</p>
<p>Once you get this mentality, you will begin an endless (and very unhealthy) relationship with food. You will start to believe you ALWAYS have to earn food .. and will only feel okay about enjoying yourself .. if you have exercised.</p>
<p>Instead, look at your patriotic pump as a FREEDOM that you are blessed to have! You have an able body that GETS to move!!!</p>
<p>And view all that 4th of July food as FUEL! Getting in a workout before a big meal is a great way to rev up your metabolism and prepare your body to USE (instead of store) any extra calories you may consume!</p>
<p>Don’t fall into this food guilt trap<em>..</em>But also don’t go to the totally opposite end of the spectrum and make the holidays an excuse to be lazy and throw all your food mindfulness out the window! Use the short 15-minute workout  below and then ENJOY your day!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>Alright .. let’s get our PATRIOTIC PUMP ON!!</strong></em></p>
<p>Here is a quick fat blasting FOLLOW-ALONG cardio workout that won’t interfere with your day full of fun with friends and family!</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='1170' height='659' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/HzkBonK4kPQ?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The video above is a FOLLOW ALONG! Just press play and get to work! This fat-blasting workout consists of only 5 exercises. You will do each exercise for 40 seconds and take a quick 20-second break before moving on to the next exercise.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Explosive Squat with Calf Raises &#8211; 40 Seconds</strong><br />
<strong>Speed Skaters &#8211; 40 Seconds</strong><br />
<strong>High Knees &#8211; 40 Seconds</strong><br />
<strong>Alternating Toe Taps &#8211; 40 Seconds</strong><br />

But like it or not, it is necessary for not only fat loss, but for overall health.</p>
<p><strong>WHAT IF</strong>…we told you that there is a way to make cardio SHORTER and at the same time MORE BENEFICIAL? Not only that but you do NOT need to spend endless hours pounding away on a treadmill to blast fat and help your heart? <strong>Sounds too good to be true … BUT IT’S NO</strong>T!</p>
<p>There really is a specific type of cardio that will get you in and out of the gym in 10-15 min tops and <strong>burns more calories than endless amounts of steady-state</strong>.</p>
<p>It’s called High-Intensity Interval Training or HIIT. Basically, you are doing cycles of short bursts of all-out intense exercise followed by short recovery periods.</p>
<p>The reason it works so well is that it not only burns calories while you are doing it, you experience something called the AFTERBURN EFFECT (EPOC.) In scientific terms, this is because of something called Excess Post Oxygen Consumption. To keep it simple for you, this basically just means your body continues to burn calories at an accelerated rate even after your workout is over.</p>
<p>How long will you continue to have that revved up metabolism resulting in more significant fat burn? Research is conflicting on this. Some say the afterburn effect lasts for up to 24 hours, while others believe that it only lasts for 2-3 hours. Either way, science seems to lean more toward HIIT when it comes to the afterburn effect because it requires more EPOC than a lower intensity steady state session. Some studies have calculated that this results in <strong>up to 15 percent more calories burned than traditional moderate-intensity exercises.</strong></p>
<p><strong>1 hour or 24 hours … if it helps us blast more fat in a shorter amount of time, we will take it!</strong></p>
<p>There are many ways you can create your own HIIT workouts. But if you don’t want to put much thought into it, one foolproof (and very effective) HIIT workout is simply hopping on a treadmill or a bike.</p>
<p><img class="size-large wp-image-6454" src="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/AdobeStock_205513720.jpeg?resize=1024%2C684&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="684" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/AdobeStock_205513720.jpeg?resize=1024%2C684&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/AdobeStock_205513720.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/AdobeStock_205513720.jpeg?resize=768%2C513&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/AdobeStock_205513720.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/AdobeStock_205513720.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" />Typically, you will work in cycles of short bursts of ALL OUT MAX EFFORT (80-90% of max heart rate) followed by short periods of rest (until your heart rate drops to between 40- 50% of your max heart rate.)<br />
If you are doing the high intervals at the right pace, you will NEED every second of recovery that follows.</p>
<p><strong>The keyword to remember with this type of cardio … ALL OUT.</strong></p>
<p>You can not give this type of cardio half effort and see optimal results. If you are not giving those HIGH INTERVALS your all (we are talking 80-90% of your max heart rate ) then you probably are better off sticking with steady-state.</p>
<p><strong>HOW DO YOU KNOW YOUR MAX HEART RATE?!</strong><br />
Here is an easy formula to calculate your personal Max Heart Rate.<br />
<strong>220 &#8211; your age = your max heart rate</strong><br />
<em>*For example, that means if you’re 35 years old, you subtract 35 from 220 to arrive at the fastest your heart should beat: 185 beats per minute. This can vary slightly from person to person based on their fitness level*</em></p>
<p>There are many different high/low cycles that you can use for HIIT. Depending on your fitness level and what exercises you choose to do, you may need to lower the duration of your HIGH interval times and/or lengthen the REST times.</p>
<p><strong>Some examples of interval cycle times could be:</strong><br />
10 seconds on &#8211; 20 seconds off<br />
20 seconds on &#8211; 20-40 seconds off<br />
30 seconds on &#8211; 30-90 seconds off</p>
<p>Anything longer than 30 seconds for the HIGH interval and you likely will not be going ALL OUT, which will make it more of a MIIT workout (moderate intensity interval training.)</p>
<p>To give you an idea of how HIIT is done, Vince did a video showing us his favorite HIIT workout. He also shows us a different method for determining your HIGH INTERVAL speed that doesn’t involve calculating heart rate.</p>
<p>The bottom line with HIIT … <strong>WORK HARD when it’s time to work and RECOVER when it’s time to rest.</strong> In this video, Vince is going to show you the BEST cardio workout for fat loss. This workout is great for anyone looking to lose weight, reduce stomach fat, or get absolutely shredded.</p>
<p>Following this routine style will make your cardio routine only 10-15 minutes max and burn more calories than standard steady-state ever could! For this workout, we&#8217;re going to need a treadmill and a bike, and we&#8217;ll be doing 5 rounds on each. Get ready to sweat!</p>

<p><strong>Exercise #1: Treadmill</strong><br />
20 Second MAX Intensity<br />
Rest 20 Seconds<br />
Repeat 5 Rounds</p>
<p><strong>Exercise #2: Bike</strong><br />
30 Second MAX Intensity<br />
Slow Pace for 30 Seconds<br />
Repeat 5 Rounds</p>
<p>As with any workout, you want to maximize your time. <strong>Don’t just train harder, train smarter!!</strong> Want to make the metabolic disruption caused by your workouts last all day long?</p>
<p>Imagine how much faster you’d burn fat if you could spike your metabolism and keep your body’s fat-burning potential going near non-stop. You can, but you need high-powered thermogenic help. <strong><a href="https://sculptnation.com/burn-lf/">BURN</a></strong> <strong>to the rescue (the belly-fat buster) <a href="https://sculptnation.com/burn-lf/">Click Here to hunt down and destroy every last belly fat cell.</a></strong></p>

<p><strong>If you aren’t sure how to perform some of these movements, we have a video demonstrating proper form and describing each one in detail!</strong></p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='1170' height='659' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/st9RSk7K3YM?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></p>
<p>Are HIIT workouts easy … <strong>NO!</strong></p>
<p>Are they effective … <strong>YES!</strong></p>
<p>If you have never done HIIT, you may see how hard they are, and be tempted to go back to those boring steady-state sessions, but we challenge you to create your own program and give it a go! As time passes, you will still be gasping for air, but it will become more familiar!</p>
<p><strong>In case you need some more reasons why HIIT may be your new GO-TO CARDIO?!</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>NO EQUIPMENT OR GYM NEEDED:<br />
</strong>If you don’t have gym access or any equipment on hand, as we showed you in the workout examples abo e, there are DOZENS of bodyweight-only exercises you can do from anywhere.</li>
<li><strong>TIME EFFICIENT:</strong><br />
These workouts take a FRACTION of the time that steady-state takes. HIIT typically lasts NO MORE than 20-30 min, and most typically 10-15 min. Some researchers have found that you can make more progress doing only 15 minutes of HIIT vs. pounding the pavement for an hour.</li>
<li><strong>BURN MORE CALORIES:</strong><br />
In addition to blasting calories while your cardio is in session, because of something called EPOC (Excess Post Oxygen Consumption) &#8211; your body burns fat for HOURS after interval training.</li>
<li><strong>BURN FAT NOT MUSCLE:</strong><br />
Studies show that both HIIT CARDIO can preserve muscle mass while still ridding the body of excess fat.</li>
<li><strong>INCREASED METABOLISM:</strong><br />
Some studies have found that HIIT stimulates the production of Human Growth Hormone (HGH) by up to 450 percent during the 24 hours after you finish HIIT.</li>
<li><strong>IT IS NOT TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE</strong><br />
You can burn more fat and calories when you work out for less time instead of more. The only trade-off is that you do have to work as hard as you possibly can during the HIGH interval periods, or you won’t get the results you’re looking for.</li>
</ul>
<p>There is a way to super-potentiate the power of your HIIT workouts and drive your metabolic rate through the roof all day long. In fact, in less than 30-seconds a day, you can prime your body to burn more calories, <strong>pull fat from your cells, then torch it before it has a chance to resettle somewhere else on your body.</strong> This is how you get rapid results… and keep them forever. <a href="https://sculptnation.com/burn/"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Click Here to Discover How (results guaranteed)</strong></span></a></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Truth is, there are tons of workouts to choose from. But if you’re looking to separate the best workout to lose weight from the rest, this workout will end your quest.</p>
<div class="embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9 mb-5">
<!-- iframe plugin v.4.4 wordpress.org/plugins/iframe/ -->
<iframe src="//youtube.com/embed/TAxI7YbZqBU" class="embed-responsive-item box-shadow-wide" width="100%" height="500" scrolling="yes" frameborder="0"></iframe>
</div>
<p class="p1">There are a few major factors that help determine what the best workout to lose weight is for you.</p>
<p class="p1">While those determining factors may differ from person to person, hopefully this workout includes a couple benefits that you like.</p>
<h3 class="p1">The Benefits</h3>
<ul>
<li class="p1">It only takes 4 minutes. So it’s not intimidating.</li>
<li class="p1">It’s a very simple workout. Only two exercises.</li>
<li class="p1">It burns tons of calories. During and after the workout.</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="p1">The Best Workout to Lose Weight</h2>
<p class="p1">This workout will only be two exercises. Each exercise will be performed for 20 seconds and followed up with a 10 second rest.</p>
<p class="p1">You will perform each exercise back to back until all 4 minutes are completed.</p>
<h3 class="p1">The Exercises</h3>
<h4 class="p1">Alternating Jumps with Reach</h4>
<p class="p1">For this exercise, you will start in pushup position. From there, you will hop your feet off the ground and hop one foot up near your hand with the other foot remaining back. Then hop again and switch feet. Do this as many times as you can for 20 seconds, then rest for 10 seconds.</p>
<h4 class="p1">Crab Toe Touches</h4>
<p class="p1">Here, you will flip over onto your butt and lift your butt off the ground with your hands and your feet. This is the crab position. From there, you will take one arm and the opposite leg and bring them up together at the top. Then return them back to the ground and switch arms and legs. Do this as many times as you can for 20 seconds and rest for 10 seconds.</p>
<p class="p1">After you have completed the entire four rounds of the workout, your workout will be over. It will not take long but it will be a great workout as long as you give it your all!</p>
<p class="p1">So try this workout and be sure to share it with your friends. Also, don’t forget to leave any comments down below!</p>

<p class="p1">Remember, workouts without understanding your body type could be a waste of time! If you want to know your body type and exactly what to do to get i shape, take our free body type quiz now! <strong><a href="https://vshred.com/sp/survey/survey-aka1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Click here to take the quiz!</a></strong></p>
<p class="p1">Truth is, we’re all pressed for time. With all the different responsibilities you have, how are you supposed to workout for an hour or even more?</p>
<p class="p1">You don’t have to!</p>
<p class="p1">When you change your workout style, and start doing high intensity interval training, workouts become shorter and results happen faster.</p>
<p class="p1">This is only a 4 minute workout that will leave you gassed and will burn tons of calories!</p>
<p class="p1">Plus, you don’t need any weights or equipment, so you can do it anywhere, at any time. Try it out!</p>
<h2 class="p1">4 Minute Cardio Workout</h2>
<p class="p1">In this workout, I take you through a quick, but effective workout to target body fat all over!</p>
<p class="p1">It&#8217;s going to be 4 exercises done for 20 seconds on with a 10 second rest. Then you&#8217;ll repeat each exercise twice to equal the full 4 minutes.</p>
<h3 class="p1">The Exercises:</h3>
<h4 class="p1">Half Burpees</h4>
<p class="p1">For this exercise, you will start down on the ground on your hands and feet. From there, you will jump your feet backs if going down for a burpee. Then jump your feet forward towards your hands like you’re going to jump up for a burpee. But instead of jumping up, jump your feet back out and repeat as many times as you can for 20 seconds. Then rest for 10 seconds and move onto the next exercise.</p>
<h4 class="p1">Jump Squats</h4>
<p class="p1">Here, you will get into a squat position, with your feet at shoulder width. From there, you will squat down, and starting from the bottom, you will explode up into a jump. Then land and go right back into your next squat. Repeat as many jump squats as you can for 20 seconds. Then rest for another 10 seconds and move onto the next exercise.</p>
<h4 class="p1">Bicycles</h4>
<p class="p1">This is a great ab exercise where you will start by laying on your back with your hands on the back of your head. From there, you will bring one knee up as high as you can, while crunching up and bringing one elbow down to meet your knee. Then repeat to the other side and do as many times as you can for 20 seconds. After this, rest for 10 seconds and move into the fourth and final exercise.</p>
<h4 class="p1">Spider Man Pushups</h4>
<p class="p1">Here, you will be doing an advanced variation of a pushup. Starting in a pushup position, you will lower yourself to the floor as you bring your knee up and out to the side. Bring it as close to your elbow as possible. Then as you press yourself back up, return your foot back to the starting position. Then repeat to the other side and do this as many times as you can for 20 seconds. If you already struggle with push-ups, don’t worry about the crunch and just do push-ups.</p>
<p class="p1">After completing all four exercises, you will rest for 10 seconds then repeat this cycle one more time.</p>

<p class="p1">Remember, in order to get in shape fast, you need to understand your body type. <a href="https://vshred.com/sp/survey/survey-aka1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">If you want to learn exactly what you should be doing to get in shape, take this free body type quiz now!</a></p>
<p class="p1">Truth is, there are tons of HIIT workouts all over the internet..</p>
<p class="p1">But what makes a HIIT workout the best cardio workout for you to do?</p>
<p class="p1">That’s obviously a difficult question that comes down to a few things..</p>
<ol>
<li class="p1">Does it work?</li>
<li class="p1">Do you enjoy it?</li>
<li class="p1">Will you be able to continue doing it?</li>
</ol>
<p class="p1">Luckily for you, this stair workout fits all of those!</p>
<p class="p1">It’s a short, but extremely effective high intensity workout. Also, it’s a great change of scenery from the typical gym cardio workout, so it’s easier to continue to be willing to do it!</p>
<h2 class="p1">The Best Cardio Workout</h2>
<p class="p1">This workout will only require a set of stairs. Bleachers or just a simple staircase will suffice.</p>
<p class="p1">There will be five different types of exercises using the stairs. You will go up the stairs performing the exercises as fast as you can, then slowly return back to the bottom as an active rest. We will do 3 sets of each exercise.</p>
<h3 class="p1">The Exercises</h3>
<h4 class="p1">Single Stair Alternating Feet</h4>
<p class="p1">For these, you will act as if you are going up stairs in regular style. Be sure to chop your arms so you can climb the stairs faster. Go all the way up to the top, then return back down slowly and repeat for 3 sets.</p>
<h4 class="p1">Double Stair Alternating Feet</h4>
<p class="p1">For these, you will do the same as the first exercise, but you will skip a step with each foot. Again, chop your arms to climb the stairs faster then return back down slowly as your rest. Repeat for 3 sets.</p>
<h4 class="p1">Single Stair Double Feet</h4>
<p class="p1">Here, you will stand on the bottom step and take both feet and hop up to the next step. Do this on every step, as quickly as you can, until you have reached the top. Then return back down slowly as your rest and repeat for 3 sets.</p>
<h4 class="p1">Stair Jumps</h4>
<p class="p1">For these, you will stand on the bottom and leap up as many steps as you can in one jump. Once you’ve landed safely on the next step, repeat the same and leap as many stairs as you can once again. Be sure to squat down and explode up. Once you’ve reached the top return back down slowly and repeat for 3 sets.</p>
<h4 class="p1">Single Stair Quick Feet</h4>
<p class="p1">For this last exercise, you will be moving your feet quickly and in short ranges of motion. Starting at the bottom, you will take one foot and bring it up to the next step. Then immediately bring the other foot up to the same step and move on to the next step. Work your way all the way up and return back down slowly. Repeat for 3 sets and you’re done!</p>
<p class="p1">To get the fastest results, do this workout 3 times per week. If you liked it, please don’t forget to share and leave your comments down below!</p>

</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1"><strong><a href="https://vshred.com/sp/survey/survey-aka1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">If you’re looking to get in shape, you must follow a plan for your body type. Click Here to take our free body type quiz and to find out yours now!</a></strong></p>
<p class="p1">Just like any body part, the body adapts to repetitive exercise. This is why when you run the first week, you see results. But then you run the same amount the following weeks and the results slow down.</p>
<p class="p1">When the basics no longer work like they once did, it’s time to start switching up your training. Try doing HIIT workouts a few times a week rather than your traditional cardio. This may lead to you putting your fat loss in hyperdrive.</p>
<h2 class="p1">HIIT Workout Plan</h2>
<p class="p1">HIIT stands for high intensity interval training. This is a cardio method that has been used to decades by people aiming to lower their body fat fast.</p>
<p class="p1">When doing a HIIT workout, you will cycle between high/max intensity intervals and low intensity/rest intervals. Each of these intervals will be less than a minute each.. sometimes even as short as 10-20 seconds but you must put your full effort into it.</p>
<p class="p1">When done correctly, a full workout should be completed in about 10/15 minutes. By doing this, you create a metabolic response in your body. This metabolic response ramps up your caloric expenditure for hours after your workout.</p>
<p class="p1">So try it 2-3 times a week and watch the fat melt!</p>
<h3 class="p1">The Workout:</h3>
<p class="p1">This HIIT workout plan will consist of only 4 exercises. You will perform each exercise for 50 seconds. Then follow up the exercise with a 10 second rest.</p>
<p class="p1">Make sure you do not extend the rest any longer than 10 seconds! It should be just enough time to get ready for your next exercise!</p>
<h4 class="p1">The Exercises:</h4>
<ul>
<li class="p1"><strong>Single Leg Burpees</strong></li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">Act as if you are going to do a regular burpee, but instead of going down to the ground with two feet back, you will only use one. Alternate legs and repeat as many times as you can for the full 50 seconds.</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1"><strong>Plank Jacks</strong></li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">For this exercise, you will start in regular plank position. From there you will hop your lower body up off the ground and widen your legs. Then immediately after, you will hop your lower body off the ground and bring your feet back together. Repeat for as many reps as you can do for the full 50 seconds.</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1"><strong>Hand Release Push Ups</strong></li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">This exercise is meant to be treated like an explosive rest/pause type exercise. Meaning you will start in regular pushup position. You will then lower yourself to the ground until you are able to pick your hands up off the ground. (This will act as a one second rest for your chest.) Then you will place your hands back on the ground and do an explosive pushup. Repeat as many times as you can for the full 50 seconds.</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1"><strong>Tuck Ups</strong></li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">For this exercise, you will start by laying flat on your back. From here, you will take your upper body and your knees and bring them together to meet in the middle. Be sure to find a good spot on your tailbone so you can balance on the ground without any pain. After you have tucked your knees into your arms, you will lower yourself back down to the ground. Repeat as many times as you can for the full 50 seconds.</p>
<p class="p1">Just one round of this workout, when done correctly, will quick HIIT workout plan will leave your heart rate skyrocketed!</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">If you’re looking to lose some weight, it’s time you start doing some HIIT workouts. For some, the idea of working out goes out the door because they don’t have a gym membership. But that doesn’t matter, due to this being an at home full body workout!</p>
<div class="embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9 mb-5">

<iframe src="//youtube.com/embed/Zz8KFMcgSgg" class="embed-responsive-item box-shadow-wide" width="100%" height="500" scrolling="yes" frameborder="0"></iframe>
</div>
<div></div>
<p class="p1">HIIT stands for high intensity interval training and if you’re not aware of the benefits.. Lets just say, they take 15 minutes or less and burn calories for up to 48 hours. Yes, you read that right and this full body workout only takes 6! It’s called excess post oxygen consumption or EPOC. This is when your body depletes your oxygen during high intensity exercise. Then burns calories to replenish those oxygen levels after you’ve finished working out.</p>
<h2 class="p1">Try This Full Body Workout</h2>
<p class="p1">For this full body workout, you will perform each exercise for 45 seconds at your maximum intensity. After those 45 seconds are up, you will then follow it up with a 15 second rest. You will do this for all exercises and you will be done. So it will be a short workout.. which means you should push yourself!</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>The Exercises</strong></p>
<p>If you want to see how to do any of these exercises, simply watch the video above as I perform them right along side you!</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">Toe Taps</li>
<li class="p1">Push Up Rotations</li>
<li class="p1">Forward Backward Lunges</li>
<li class="p1">High Knees</li>
<li class="p1">Squat Jump Rotations</li>
<li class="p1">Bicycles</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">Again, make sure you are pushing yourself during the high intensity intervals as you will only be cheating yourself if you are taking it easy! To follow along with me as I do the workout, watch the video at the top and let’s kill it!</p>
