That is a scary number!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Good thing you found this article because </span><b><i>we aren’t going to let YOU be “most” people! </i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lower temps do not have to equal larger waistlines! You just have to have a plan! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this short read we will &#8230;</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Explain why winter weight gain happens. Knowing why is important if you want to prevent it and the reason is probably not what you think. In fact, it is partially not even your fault!</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tell you why fall/winter is actually the BEST time to start a diet and training plan.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Give you 7 easy pro tips that will help guide you through the next few months. </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You may believe winter weight gain happens because of the holidays. Those extra home cooked meals and holiday parties are certainly a factor. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But </span><b><i>there is a DAILY issue you need to be prepared to fight </i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">if you want to avoid packing on winter pounds.</span></p>
<p><b>WHY YOU REALLY PACK ON POUNDS AFTER LABOR DAY</b></p>
<p><img class="size-large wp-image-7471" src="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_130930953.jpeg?resize=1024%2C512&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="512" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_130930953.jpeg?resize=1024%2C512&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_130930953.jpeg?resize=300%2C150&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_130930953.jpeg?resize=768%2C384&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_130930953.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_130930953.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the spring and summer months, you are given what we call a</span><b> fitness freebie. </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You get a </span><b><i>seasonal motivation boost</i></b> <span style="font-weight: 400;">that doesn’t happen when temperatures start to drop, and you begin to pull out the chunky sweaters and comfy leggings. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not only is the sun shining (which makes you happier because of Vitamin D), you are wearing LESS clothing in the summer months. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I don’t know about you, but knowing I’m going to be exposing more skin makes walking in the gym a little easier. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Covering up in layers, no doubt leads to the temptation to slack on body goals! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Knowing your arms, legs, and abs will be less exposed can easily be an excuse to slack. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, being layered up often means you don’t SEE the extra pounds, so they are easier to ignore.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But there is more to it than being bundled up….</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-7477" src="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_236518834.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_236518834.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_236518834.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_236518834.jpeg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_236518834.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_236518834.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span>The #1 reason you slack on health and fitness goals in colder months ISN’T EVEN YOUR FAULT!!</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, you have a part to play in all of this, but</span><b><i> there is actually a scientific reason why you have less desire to train and eat healthy when the sunshine of summer fades.</i></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We will explain why a little further down. But ya know what really stinks? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The scientific reason why we all experience these motivation slumps in the winter only adds to an even bigger issue with motivation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span>It doesn’t matter what season it is motivation ALWAYS comes and goes!</p>
<p>Spring, Summer, Fall, or Winter &#8211; you can NEVER rely on it!</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, what can you do when lack of sunshine and warm temps leave you even more tempted to hit snooze and reach for comfort foods? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You certainly don’t throw your hands up in the air and wait until January to make a resolution to crash diet to get your body ready for spring. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Believe it or not, RIGHT NOW is actually the IDEAL time to get started! </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you </span><b><i>START NOW, </i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">you will develop discipline and a routine heading into the holidays. This will put you in a great place mentally and physically to relax and “indulge” a little more at all those holiday gatherings! </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><b><i>Look at it this way ..<br />
</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Would you rather head into the holiday season already making progress toward your goals and be in a great spot <em>(where it would be okay even if you did gain an extra pound or two?)</em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Or would you rather put it off and only add more fat on top of what you want to lose?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The answer is clear— the solution to getting the motivation needed to make it happen, not so much.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But don’t worry! We’ve got ya covered</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (no pun intended)</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with a few easy motivation hacks!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><b>7 TIPS TO STAY MOTIVATED AS SEASONS CHANGE</b></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><b><br />
</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the number one questions we always get is … “<em>I am just not motivated. How can I motivate myself to train and eat better?”</em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As we mentioned earlier, it doesn&#8217;t matter what season it is, </span><b><i>you can’t always rely on motivation. </i></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you have it, great! You should certainly take advantage of it! But you have to know that it is totally normal to not have much of it. Even professional athletes lack motivation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You have to develop other daily habits that create discipline if you want to succeed long term!</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are a few of our pro tips that we use with our clients, specifically when temperatures drop, and motivation seems to be at its lowest! </span></p>
<p><b>TIP #1: Switch To An At Home Training Program</b></p>
<p><img class="size-large wp-image-7448" src="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_185038762.jpeg?resize=1024%2C647&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="647" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_185038762.jpeg?resize=1024%2C647&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_185038762.jpeg?resize=300%2C189&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_185038762.jpeg?resize=768%2C485&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_185038762.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_185038762.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you know that getting out of bed and stepping into the winter elements is going to be an excuse trigger, make a plan to train at home during cooler months! Some of the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">most effective and challenging workouts </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">only require your body weight and </span><b><i>maybe</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a set of dumbbells or some resistance bands.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A good fat-blasting, muscle-building sweat session can 100% be achieved from the comfort of your home!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adjustable dumbbells, ankle weights, resistance bands, a jump rope, etc., are all things that are inexpensive and can easily be stored in a closet or under your bed and pulled out anytime you don’t feel like leaving the house.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But if you have </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">the right training program</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><b><i>you don’t need any of that. </i></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our favorite </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">at-home bodyweight-only program</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is called</span><b> MOVE. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was designed to help you achieve your fitness goals without a single piece of equipment, and each workout is under 20 minutes! </span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Learn more about MOVE by watching the video below!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you need </span><b>a little extra “nudge”</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to get up and get moving, another </span><b>pro-tip we use</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is keeping some </span><a href="https://sculptnation.com/products/pre-workout" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><b>PRE WORKOUT </b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">on your bedside table. Have it already blended up and chug it as soon as your alarm goes off!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By the time you have brushed your teeth and put on your workout clothes, you will have a nice little jolt of energy and</span><b><i> tons of motivation</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to get going before you have a chance to come up with an excuse! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the bottom of this article, we will tell you about a big end of summer sale happening so that you can stock up on our </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">favorite </span><a href="https://sculptnation.com/products/pre-workout" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><b>PRE WORKOUT</b></a><strong> for 40% off when you use code: LABORDAY40 at checkout! </strong></p>
<p><b>TIP #2: Make Your Workouts Seasonal</b></p>
<p><img class="size-large wp-image-7452" src="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_65703942.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_65703942.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_65703942.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_65703942.jpeg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_65703942.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_65703942.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Embrace the change of seasons and take advantage of activities that you can only do in fall or winter! </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Go on a fall hike and view all the gorgeous foliage.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Try rock climbing.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Walk around a corn maze or pumpkin patch with your family. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you live in a snowy climate, go skiing, sledding, build snowmen with your kids, etc.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Go ice skating.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lace-up your sneakers, go for a walk or run at night, and admire all the Christmas lights and decorations.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are some things you can only do and see during specific times of the year. So instead of missing sunshine and water sports, focus on all the positive things that only come about with cooler temps!</span></p>
<p><b>TIP #3: Try Something Totally New</b></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-7454" src="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_361152601.jpeg?resize=1024%2C514&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="514" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_361152601.jpeg?resize=1024%2C514&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_361152601.jpeg?resize=300%2C151&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_361152601.jpeg?resize=768%2C386&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_361152601.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_361152601.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sometimes a change of routine is all you need to boost motivation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you have been doing all your gym lifts alone, recruit a gym buddy! Try switching up your cardio by skipping your solo runs and joining a group fitness class instead. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another option is to </span><b><i>allow yourself to slow down!</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> If you have been crushing it all spring and summer with intense training and hardcore workouts, </span><b><i>it may actually be time to take it down a notch. </i></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Going full force 365 can cause your stress hormone cortisol to increase. This can lead to a host of drawbacks, including weight gain, muscle loss, poor moods, fatigue, and occasional issues sleeping! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We aren’t saying you should become lazy! But if you have been crushing it 24/7 all spring and summer, your body (and mind) may need to slow down.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Use the next few months to embrace a slower routine. </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Commit to daily yoga.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Focus on becoming more flexible.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Switch to low or moderate-intensity cardio, instead of HIIT.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Try out some bodyweight workouts instead of heavy lifting.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Giving your body a couple of months to recover might even make you more responsive when you decide to kick things up again come spring/summer!</span></p>
<p><b>TIP #4: Stay Accountable</b></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-7457" src="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_266584820.jpeg?resize=1024%2C768&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="768" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_266584820.jpeg?resize=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_266584820.jpeg?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_266584820.jpeg?resize=768%2C576&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_266584820.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_266584820.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><b><br />
</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">The best way to stick to a plan is to have someone that you report back to. This could be a friend, family member, a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">social media community</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, or even a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">coach. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Including someone else, or even just telling someone else about your health and fitness goals and asking them to check in with you to make sure you are sticking to the plan, is a great way to keep the promises you make to yourself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you prefer to fly solo, it helps to create visuals. Make a vision board, create a daily checklist you can mark off after each workout, or keep an accomplishment journal.</span></p>
<p><b>TIP #5: Set A Spring Goal</b></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-7458" src="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_47332240.jpeg?resize=1024%2C680&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="680" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_47332240.jpeg?resize=1024%2C680&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_47332240.jpeg?resize=300%2C199&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_47332240.jpeg?resize=768%2C510&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_47332240.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_47332240.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">March may seem like a long time away, but it will be back before you know it, and 6 months is a long time to make significant changes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Setting a goal is a great way to encourage yourself to push past discomforts and temptation, but there is a science to goal setting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The key to creating goals that stick .. </span><b><i>be REALISTIC and SPECIFIC!</i></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s start with </span><b><i>reality. </i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">You should always focus on one goal at a time and make sure you are being honest with yourself if that goal is really attainable.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you know that your schedule will never allow you to work out 6 days a week, why would you choose a program that requires you to do that?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you know it’s not healthy to attempt to lose 10 pounds a week, why would you aim that high?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you love carbs, why would you go on a KETO diet? </span></p>
<p><b><i>Doing these things will essentially set yourself up for failure.</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Set attainable goals that fit YOUR lifestyle. You can always bump things up if your schedule allows, or you notice you aren’t pushing yourself hard enough. Just keep in mind that being realistic isn’t the same as not believing in yourself or making excuses. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moving on to being </span><b><i>specific.</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The more specific you are about your goals, the more likely you will be to reach them. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It may seem like it’s good enough to say things like .. I want to look good, lose weight, or get ripped! </span><b><i>But you have to dig deeper than that!! </i></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wanting to “lose weight,” for example, is an excellent place to start. But ask yourself what that means to you?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you expand on that and say &#8212; “I want to lose 10 pounds of fat. I will do this by not eating any sweets and doing the V Shred </span><a href="https://vshred.com/sp/move/soc-all/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><b>MOVE </b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">program for 30 consecutive days. I am doing this because I want to have better self-esteem and a head start on bikini season.” &#8212; that makes your goal more specific.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The more specific (and attainable) your goals are, the more likely you will be to not give up!</span></p>
<p><b>TIP #6: Reward Yourself</b></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-7459" src="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/vin_sant_32048508_366936073798151_433609263865135104_n.jpg?resize=882%2C1024&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="882" height="1024" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/vin_sant_32048508_366936073798151_433609263865135104_n.jpg?resize=882%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 882w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/vin_sant_32048508_366936073798151_433609263865135104_n.jpg?resize=258%2C300&amp;ssl=1 258w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/vin_sant_32048508_366936073798151_433609263865135104_n.jpg?resize=768%2C892&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/vin_sant_32048508_366936073798151_433609263865135104_n.jpg?w=1080&amp;ssl=1 1080w" sizes="(max-width: 882px) 100vw, 882px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you have checked a “mini goal” off your list, treat yourself. Knowing that you have a reward coming to celebrate your efforts will make you want to achieve it even more. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It may be tempting to make your reward one of your favorite “forbidden foods” but we never suggest that you reward yourself this way.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You aren’t a dog. You should never reward “good behavior” with food. Having this mentality can create a really unhealthy relationship with food.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You need to eat healthy MOST of the time, control your portions, and see food as fuel. But if you are craving something that isn’t quite as healthy as your grilled chicken and rice, never feel like you need to lose 20 pounds to “deserve” a bite of cake, or nice dinner out with your family. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instead of rewarding yourself with food, buy yourself something you have been wanting. Maybe some new workout clothes, a massage, or an extra $20 bucks in your vacation fund! </span></p>

<p><b>TIP #7: Make Mental Health Top Priority</b></p>
<p><img class="size-large wp-image-7460" src="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_255894146.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_255894146.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_255894146.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_255894146.jpeg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_255894146.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_255894146.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Earlier, we mentioned that cold weather motivation dips may not be your fault.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’m sure you have heard of winter blues. Well, it’s a real thing. Less natural light can cause dips in serotonin, the neurotransmitter that regulates mood.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The dark and dreary days of winter can also cause your body to produce more of the sleep hormone melatonin. This shift can disrupt your body and impact your sleep patterns and overall mood.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are a few ways that you can focus on improving your mental health.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Invest in a light therapy box that simulates natural daylight.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Make sure you are supplementing with or eating plenty of foods with Vitamin D.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Start journaling. There is a lot of scientific evidence that supports putting your thoughts on paper provides a long list of benefits, including stress management, self-confidence, and goal setting. </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Suppose you still find yourself struggling with negative seasonal motivation shifts. In that case, you may need to experiment with taking</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> naturally sourced herbs</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to help support brain health and a positive mood.</span></p>
<p><b><i>Here are a few with some great scientific backing to help boost mood.</i></b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>EnXtra: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">A natural caffeine-free patent-pending botanical ingredient that has been shown to help increase dopamine levels.**It is also one of the first and only natural caffeine-free patent-pending botanical ingredients shown to boost mental alertness &amp; acuity for hours or ending in a huge caffeine energy crash.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Piper Nigrum Fruit Extract:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> A very specific type of black pepper that has been shown to help increase both serotonin and dopamine.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>L-Theanine:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> A powerful amino acid that is believed to help reduce occasional anxiety brought on by stressful situations.</span></li>
</ul>

<p><b><i>BOTTOM LINE IF YOU WANT TO STAY MOTIVATED YEAR ROUND</i></b><b><i><br />
</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you put away the shorts and swimsuits and shift out of bikini season, it’s common for motivation to “fall back” with the clocks. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The seasons have to change (unless you live near the equator) &#8211; so you have to figure out ways to</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">not let your fitness goals go into hibernation mode!</span><b><i> </i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pumpkin spice lattes are only here for a limited time, but getting into shape isn’t seasonal! </span><i>It&#8217;s a year-round commitment!!</i><i> </i></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you wanna lose that belly fat and get ripped six pack abs, you don&#8217;t need to hire an expensive personal trainer or go to the gym. All you need to do is get a dumbbell and follow these workout routines!</p>
<h2>Weighted Ab Workout For A Ripped Six Pack Abs</h2>
<h3></h3>
<h3>Start With Your Gut</h3>
<p><!-- instagram error: invalid instagram resource --></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">When it comes to getting ripped six pack abs, there’s one thing you should not overlook. Diet. So before you try this workout, if you’re not sure <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/healthy-eating-mistakes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">what you should be eating</a> in order to really chisel your abs, take my free body type quiz to learn the 3 most important things to do to see results.</span></p>
<div>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://vshred.com/sp/survey/survey-aka1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="s1">Click Here To Take The Free Body Type Quiz!</span></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Once your <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/healthy-eating-mistakes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">dietary concerns</a> are out of the way, it’s time to train those abs! Abs are just like any other muscle group, but smaller than most. That means you need to train them and let them recover just like any other muscle. So we recommend doing this weighted ab workout no more than every other day making sure to allow your abdominal muscles to recover completely.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">All you will need for this workout is a single dumbbell. You may pick the weight of your choice or use no weight at all (this depends on your physical capability) and do as follows:</span></p>
<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1">The Workout</span></h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There are four total exercises and for each exercise, you will do 4 sets of 10-15 reps with only 20 seconds of rest in-between. If you cannot handle this layout, you may extend your rest period slightly or break the sets into “mini sets” but make sure to complete the same total number of reps.</span></p>
<h3><span class="s1">Dumbbell Straight-Arm Crunches</span></h3>
<p><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/3ksxlaN8sLsKFMri0P"><img src="https://i0.wp.com/media.giphy.com/media/3ksxlaN8sLsKFMri0P/giphy.gif?resize=480%2C270&#038;ssl=1" alt="Animated GIF - Find &amp; Share on GIPHY" width="480" height="270" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In this abs routine, you’re going to lay flat on your back with your knees bent. Hold the dumbbell out straight above you and continue to push the dumbbell straight towards the ceiling as you crunch.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">4 sets of 10-15 reps. </span></p>
<h3><span class="s1">Dumbbell Reverse Crunches</span></h3>
<p><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/B1SY1kmjV1yVAJcbpJ"><img src="https://i2.wp.com/media.giphy.com/media/B1SY1kmjV1yVAJcbpJ/giphy.gif?resize=480%2C270&#038;ssl=1" alt="Animated GIF - Find &amp; Share on GIPHY" width="480" height="270" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Lay flat on your back again for this one but this time, place a dumbbell between your feet with your knees completely bent and thighs pointing straight up. Hold on to the dumbbell with your feet and bring your legs up toward your chest making sure your lower back gets off the ground. Focus on using your abs to pull your legs up and not getting momentum from your knees or feet. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">4 sets of 10-15 reps.</span></p>
<h3><span class="s1">Rotating Mountain Climbers</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For this one, get into a regular push-up position. Now, similar to mountain climbers, you will be driving your knees upward but will also do a twist as you do so. So you drive your knees to your opposite elbow as you twist your core.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">4 sets of 10-15 reps each way.</span></p>
<h3><span class="s1">Dumbbell Woodchops</span></h3>
<p><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/uANrWMqcPO9s62VFoZ"><img src="https://i0.wp.com/media.giphy.com/media/uANrWMqcPO9s62VFoZ/giphy.gif?resize=480%2C270&#038;ssl=1" alt="Animated GIF - Find &amp; Share on GIPHY" width="480" height="270" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Stand with a single dumbbell held by both hands and start off by turning your shoulders completely to one side, keeping the dumbbell low. Rotate your shoulders to the opposite side as you raise the dumbbell up high above your head in the process. Focus on engaging your core with the twists.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">4 sets of 10-15 each way.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">These core exercises, </span>as well as other <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/workout-plans-weight-loss/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">fat burning workouts</a>,<span style="font-size: 1rem;">will h</span>elp you get six pack abs and lead a healthier, more active life.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Follow V Shred’s full leg workout routine to build bigger, stronger, and leaner lower body muscles.</p>
<h2>5-Move Leg Day Regimen | Hardcore Full Leg Workout Routine</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>1. Barbell Squats</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-5256 size-full" src="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Barbell-Squats-full-leg-workout.jpg?resize=625%2C349&#038;ssl=1" alt="Barbell Squats | V Shred's Ultimate Full Leg Workout" width="625" height="349" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Barbell-Squats-full-leg-workout.jpg?w=625&amp;ssl=1 625w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Barbell-Squats-full-leg-workout.jpg?resize=300%2C168&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><strong>Reps</strong>: 20</p>
<p><strong>Sets:</strong> 3</p>
<p><strong>Muscles Worked:</strong> Quads, glutes</p>
<p>Our full leg workout routine starts off with some <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/how-to-do-squats-exercises-for-knee-pain/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">barbell squats</a>. They’re a strength-training movement that works the whole body with an emphasis on your quads and glutes.</p>
<p>The number one thing to remember when squatting is proper form. Remember: the quality of your reps will always outweigh the volume or quantity.</p>
<ul>
<li>Place a loaded bar across your traps, position your feet shoulder-width apart, point your toes forward, and arch your hips out. This will be your starting position.</li>
<li>With your hips coming down first, lower your body until your knees bend at a 90-degree angle. Remember to keep all the weight on your heels and to push your chest out as your body descends.</li>
<li>From here, push your body back up using your leg muscles. This counts as one rep.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> You don’t necessarily need to go ass to grass when squatting. Going further than a 90-degree bend will put an unnecessary strain on your back.</p>
<h3>2. Leg Press</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-5257 size-full" src="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Leg-Press-full-leg-workout.jpg?resize=625%2C349&#038;ssl=1" alt="Leg Press | V Shred's Ultimate Full Leg Workout" width="625" height="349" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Leg-Press-full-leg-workout.jpg?w=625&amp;ssl=1 625w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Leg-Press-full-leg-workout.jpg?resize=300%2C168&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><strong>Reps:</strong> 20 to 30</p>
<p><strong>Sets:</strong> 5</p>
<p><strong>Muscles Worked:</strong> Outer quads, hamstrings</p>
<p>When doing leg presses, your goal should be to achieve a pump in your leg muscles. Do multiple reps of a weight you’re comfortable with to distribute sufficient blood and oxygen to the right muscle groups.</p>
<ul>
<li>Sit down on the leg press machine and prop your feet up on the platform in front of you. This is the optimal foot placement to target your outer quads.</li>
<li>Push the platform up using your legs. Remember not to fully straighten your legs. They should slightly bend to avoid leg injury.</li>
<li>Next, lower the weight down until your knees bend at a 90-degree angle. During this part, you’ll feel your outer quads and hamstrings contract.</li>
<li>Push the weight back up using your legs. Again, remember to not overextend your legs or lock them at the knees. This counts as one rep.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> Similar to barbell squats, you don’t necessarily need to go all the way down. Stop when your knees bend at a 90-degree angle to avoid straining your lower back.</p>
<h3>3. Walking Lunges</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-5258 size-full" src="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Walking-Lunges-full-leg-workout.jpg?resize=625%2C351&#038;ssl=1" alt="Walking Lunges | V Shred's Ultimate Full Leg Workout" width="625" height="351" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Walking-Lunges-full-leg-workout.jpg?w=625&amp;ssl=1 625w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Walking-Lunges-full-leg-workout.jpg?resize=300%2C168&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><strong>Reps:</strong> 10 each leg</p>
<p><strong>Sets:</strong> 5</p>
<p><strong>Muscles Worked:</strong> Quads</p>
<p>Walking lunges are a great addition to our killer leg workout routine. It’s a dynamic exercise that targets your quads every step of the way –literally.</p>
<ul>
<li>Place the bar across your traps, place your feet shoulder-width apart, and balance your entire weight on your heels. This will be your starting position.</li>
<li>Take a step forward with your left foot then lower your torso until your right knee almost touches the ground and your left thigh is parallel to the ground.</li>
<li>Lift yourself up by driving your heel to the ground then do the same with your other leg.</li>
<li>While doing walking lunges, keep the weight at the back, not the front. Also, push your chest out as you’re lunging.</li>
</ul>
<h3>4. Romanian Deadlifts</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-5259 size-full" src="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Romanian-Deadlifts-full-leg-workout.jpg?resize=625%2C353&#038;ssl=1" alt="Romanian Deadlifts | V Shred's Ultimate Full Leg Workout" width="625" height="353" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Romanian-Deadlifts-full-leg-workout.jpg?w=625&amp;ssl=1 625w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Romanian-Deadlifts-full-leg-workout.jpg?resize=300%2C169&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><strong>Reps:</strong> 15 to 20</p>
<p><strong>Sets:</strong> 3</p>
<p><strong>Muscles Worked:</strong> Hamstrings, glutes</p>
<p>Romanian deadlifts are great exercises to <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/hamstring-workouts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">strengthen your hamstrings</a>. You should feel the movement from the bottom of your legs to your glutes.</p>
<ul>
<li>Stand upright with a loaded barbell in front of you, arms at the sides, and feet shoulder-width apart.</li>
<li>Lift the weight up with a shoulder-width-apart grip and let it hang just below your pelvis. Next, slowly lower the weight down while keeping your legs stiff.</li>
<li>As you lower the weight, push your butt back as far as you can. The key here is to make full-range movements. Go all the way down and extend all the way up.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> Form is very important. Keep your hips in and chest out. Get one of them wrong and you might pull a muscle and injure yourself.</p>
<h3>5. Calves</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-5260 size-full" src="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Calves-full-leg-workout.jpg?resize=625%2C349&#038;ssl=1" alt="Calves | V Shred's Ultimate Full Leg Workout" width="625" height="349" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Calves-full-leg-workout.jpg?w=625&amp;ssl=1 625w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Calves-full-leg-workout.jpg?resize=300%2C168&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><strong>Reps:</strong> 20 to 40</p>
<p><strong>Sets:</strong>  3 to 5</p>
<p><strong>Muscles Worked:</strong> Calves</p>
<p>The main trick to growing your calf muscles is to do enough high-quality reps. That’s why we want to perform three to five sets of 20 to 40 reps per leg day.</p>
<ul>
<li>Sit down on the leg press machine and place your feet on the bottom part of the platform.</li>
<li>Only the balls of your feet should press against it. Your heels should be hanging off of it.</li>
<li>Push the weight up as if you are tiptoeing, using the balls of your feet, while keeping your legs straight in front of you. Lower it back down using the same muscles. This counts as one rep.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Tip</strong>: You can also do these leg workouts with dumbbells. Make sure that you feel the contraction in your calf muscles. In fact, it’s not about the weight, it’s more about muscle contraction.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Try this no-equipment workout plan to shed the fat from Thanksgiving&#8217;s feast.</p>
<h2>Complete Thanksgiving Day No-Equipment Workout Plan</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Step 1: Warm Up Your Muscles</h3>
<p><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/dty6dNBSDmVeAESCA5"><img src="https://i2.wp.com/media.giphy.com/media/dty6dNBSDmVeAESCA5/giphy.gif?resize=480%2C270&#038;ssl=1" alt="Animated GIF - Find &amp; Share on GIPHY" width="480" height="270" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>After a night of heavy eating and drinking, you’re bound to feel too lazy to move. But that’s nothing a little dynamic warm-up activity can’t fix.</p>
<p>First, jog in place for a few seconds to get your heart rate up. Next, do some jumping jacks for one minute. Then cap it off with some 45-second vertical jumps.</p>
<p>Do these three exercises three times before moving on to the workout. This will help warm your body up to prevent injuries and ensure peak athletic performance.</p>
<p>After warming up, take a few seconds to catch your breath. You’ll perform the next seven exercises continuously without resting.</p>
<h3>Step 2: Drop Some Squats</h3>
<p><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/OjY3mPQsw1lzPkGwSo"><img src="https://i1.wp.com/media.giphy.com/media/OjY3mPQsw1lzPkGwSo/giphy.gif?resize=480%2C270&#038;ssl=1" alt="Animated GIF - Find &amp; Share on GIPHY" width="480" height="270" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Reps:</strong> 15 to 30</p>
<p>The bodyweight squat is a great full-body workout that targets your quads and glutes. During this exercise, remember to distribute your bodyweight evenly to your heels.</p>
<p>Stand upright with your feet shoulder-width apart and arms straight in front of you. Push your butt back then lower your torso until your knees are parallel to the floor.</p>
<p>Squeeze your glutes for half a count then push your body back up by driving your heels to the ground. This counts as one rep.</p>
<h3>Step 3: Bust Out Some Push-Ups</h3>
<p><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/2jMD8FKw29bA9VWtUu"><img src="https://i0.wp.com/media.giphy.com/media/2jMD8FKw29bA9VWtUu/giphy.gif?resize=480%2C270&#038;ssl=1" alt="Animated GIF - Find &amp; Share on GIPHY" width="480" height="270" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Reps:</strong> 15 to 30</p>
<p>Push-ups are great exercises that promote overall upper body strength. They mainly work your pecs.</p>
<p>Go down to a full plank position. Place your hands slightly wider than your shoulders’ width. This will be your starting position.</p>
<p>Keeping your back straight, lower your body until your chest is only one to two inches away from the floor. Drive your hands to the ground to push your body back up. This counts as one rep.</p>
<h3>Step 4: Lunge Your Way to Better Legs</h3>
<p><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/1ncs4PsbrTdoKPdbQM"><img src="https://i0.wp.com/media.giphy.com/media/1ncs4PsbrTdoKPdbQM/giphy.gif?resize=480%2C270&#038;ssl=1" alt="Animated GIF - Find &amp; Share on GIPHY" width="480" height="270" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Reps:</strong> 15 to 30 each leg</p>
<p>Doing lunges is a great way to blast thigh fat and replace it with strong, lean leg muscles. Plus, it’ll help <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/glute-workouts-home-gym/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shape your butt</a>.</p>
<p>First, stand upright with your feet hip-width apart, arms at the sides, and eyes locked forward. Take a step forward with your left foot then bend both knees to lower your body.</p>
<p>Your right leg should almost touch the ground and your left knee should bend at 90 degrees. Push your body back up. This counts as one rep.</p>
<p>After one set, do it all over again with your other leg.</p>
<h3>Step 5: Balance Your Body With Single-Leg Deadlifts</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-5236 size-full" src="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Side-view-of-woman-runner-stretching-warm-up-with-single-leg-deadlift-no-equipment-workout-plan-ss.jpg?resize=625%2C400&#038;ssl=1" alt="Balance Your Body With Single-Leg Deadlifts | Workout Plan To Burn Off Those Thanksgiving Calories (Thanksgiving Day Workout Plan)" width="625" height="400" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Side-view-of-woman-runner-stretching-warm-up-with-single-leg-deadlift-no-equipment-workout-plan-ss.jpg?w=625&amp;ssl=1 625w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Side-view-of-woman-runner-stretching-warm-up-with-single-leg-deadlift-no-equipment-workout-plan-ss.jpg?resize=300%2C192&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><strong>Reps</strong>: 15 to 30</p>
<p>Doing this full body workout without weights is a solid way to exercise your leg muscles and abdominal stabilizer muscles at the same time.</p>
<p>Stand upright with your feet together and arms at the sides. Pull your left leg up behind you and balance yourself. This will be your starting position.</p>
<p>Lower your body by bending your right knee until your right hand touches the ground. Lift your body back up by driving your heel to the floor.</p>
<p>This counts as one rep. Perform 15 to 30 reps then do the same with your other leg.</p>
<h3>Step 6: Do the Shoulder Sculptor for Lean Arms</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-5237 size-full" src="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/biceps-triceps-fit-fitness-muscle-no-equipment-workout-plan-pb.jpg?resize=625%2C400&#038;ssl=1" alt="Do the Shoulder Sculptor for Lean Arms | Workout Plan To Burn Off Those Thanksgiving Calories (Thanksgiving Day Workout Plan)" width="625" height="400" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/biceps-triceps-fit-fitness-muscle-no-equipment-workout-plan-pb.jpg?w=625&amp;ssl=1 625w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/biceps-triceps-fit-fitness-muscle-no-equipment-workout-plan-pb.jpg?resize=300%2C192&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><strong>Reps:</strong> 15 to 30</p>
<p>The shoulder sculptor is an isolation exercise that <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/5-deltoid-exercises-to-strengthen-and-sculpt-your-shoulders/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">targets your deltoids</a>.</p>
<p>Stand upright and lift your arms straight in front of you parallel to the floor.</p>
<p>Next, pull your arms to the sides and bend your elbows at a 90-degree angle, about the same level as the top of your head.</p>
<p>From here, push your hands up toward the sky. This counts as one rep. Repeat everything in reverse.</p>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> To make this more challenging, use two cans of soups as your dumbbells. Make sure the two cans have the same weight.</p>
<h3>Step 7: Wall Sits for Stronger Legs</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-5238 size-full" src="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Young-sportswoman-doing-wall-sit-exercise-outdoors-no-equipment-workout-plan-ss.jpg?resize=625%2C400&#038;ssl=1" alt="Wall Sits for Stronger Legs | Workout Plan To Burn Off Those Thanksgiving Calories (Thanksgiving Day Workout Plan)" width="625" height="400" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Young-sportswoman-doing-wall-sit-exercise-outdoors-no-equipment-workout-plan-ss.jpg?w=625&amp;ssl=1 625w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Young-sportswoman-doing-wall-sit-exercise-outdoors-no-equipment-workout-plan-ss.jpg?resize=300%2C192&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><strong>Reps:</strong> Hold for 1 minute</p>
<p>A great way to squat heavier is to strengthen your leg muscles through other exercises.</p>
<p>Wall sits are like planks for your leg muscles. You won’t be able to last long if you have a weak core and lower body.</p>
<p>Go into a squat position with your back pressing against the wall. Make sure your thighs are parallel to the floor. Hold this position for one minute.</p>
<h3>Step 8: Strengthen Your Triceps With Chair Dips</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-5239 size-full" src="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Young-woman-exercise-at-home-healthy-lifestyle-no-equipment-workout-plan-ss.jpg?resize=625%2C400&#038;ssl=1" alt="Strengthen Your Triceps With Chair Dips | Workout Plan To Burn Off Those Thanksgiving Calories (Thanksgiving Day Workout Plan)" width="625" height="400" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Young-woman-exercise-at-home-healthy-lifestyle-no-equipment-workout-plan-ss.jpg?w=625&amp;ssl=1 625w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Young-woman-exercise-at-home-healthy-lifestyle-no-equipment-workout-plan-ss.jpg?resize=300%2C192&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><strong>Reps:</strong> 15 to 30</p>
<p>The last exercise in our Thanksgiving Day workout circuit is the triceps chair dip. They’re essential to <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/bicep-workout-bigger-arms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">building solid, lean arms</a>.</p>
<p>Sit on the floor with a chair behind you. Lift your body up a bit then grab the edge of the chair with both your hands.</p>
<p>Extend your legs balancing yourself on your heels. Lift your body up by straightening your arms. This will be your starting position.</p>
<p>Lower your body by bending your elbows until they hit 90 degrees. Push down on the chair to lift your body back up to the starting position. This counts as one rep.</p>
<h3>Step 9: Active Rest</h3>
<p>After this, take three minutes of active rest –light jogging or brisk walking. Aim to go through the circuit three to four times.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When I’m specifically trying to gain strength or size through my entire body, I rotate through this 5-day workout routine.</p>
<p>In this article:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="#chest">Day 1: Chest</a></li>
<li><a href="#back">Day 2: Back</a></li>
<li><a href="#legs">Day 3: Legs</a></li>

<li><a href="#shoulders">Day 5: Shoulders</a></li>
</ol>
<h2>5 Day Weekly Workout Routine</h2>
<p>When I prescribe workouts for my clients, I always make sure I’ve done each and every one of the exercises as well as the routine itself to make sure it works the muscles I want to be working, to make sure it’s set at the proper difficulty, and to make sure I’ve done a run through for when questions arise. I do change up my workout routines from time to time, but in general, my <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/weight-training-beginners/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">weight training</a> stays relatively consistent.</p>
<p>Based on the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) guidelines for resistance training, if you’re trying to gain strength or size, it’s ideal to hit each major muscle group at least twice a week. <strong>Major muscle groups include chest, core, arms, shoulders, back, and legs.</strong> Because of these guidelines, I have a couple of different routines I go through. Below is one of my primary weekly routines.</p>
<div id="chest">

<p>In addition to my weekly routine of weight training, all of my lifting is followed up by at least 20 minutes of <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/full-cardio-workout-done-in-only-4-minutes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cardio</a>. I’ll generally do <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/hiit-workout-plan-burn-calories-in-4-minutes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HIIT training</a> if it’s only 20-25 minutes of cardio. Anything that hits 30 minutes of cardio generally entails more steady-state cardio. I aim to get at least 2 miles on the treadmill during my cardio sessions.</p>
<p><strong>Complete this weekly routine, take your supplements, and watch your body put on muscle and lose body fat week by week. Tell us about your journey in the comments below.</strong></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>What is strength training and what do you get from it? Strength or resistance training is a great way to build muscle while burning fat. It also has a large number of other benefits like more energy, less anxiety and stress, and an overall improved mood. In fact, doing weight training every day offers health benefits related to heart disease like high blood pressure, cholesterol, and obesity. Here’s everything you need to know before beginning your weight training.</p>
<h2>What Is Strength Training and How Do You Get Started</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>What is Strength Training?</h3>
<p><!-- instagram error: invalid instagram resource --></p>
<p>Strength training is a form of physical exercise where you use resistance to build the size, strength, and endurance of your muscles. Basically, any exercise where your body moves against resistance <span>classifies as </span>strength training.</p>
<h3>How to Do Strength Training?</h3>
<p>You can use resistance bands, barbells, dumbbells, or even your own body weight as resistance for your strength training. There are different exercises you can use to create different workout routines.</p>
<p>Here are three common types of strength training:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Circuit Training:</strong> This workout routine combines cardio and resistance training for a total body workout. For example, after every 3 to 5 sets of weight training, you mix in <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/best-cardio-workout-done-at-home-in-4-minutes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">3 to 5 minutes of cardio</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Split Routine:</strong> The split routine is commonly used by bodybuilders, so they can focus on which muscle to target every session. For example, on the first day, you target your chest and biceps. On the second, you can do your back and triceps. On the third day, you exercise your legs.</li>
<li><strong>Powerlifting:</strong> Powerlifters often focus on function rather than form. If you want to learn how to lift barbells twice your weight over your head, then you should learn powerlifting.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> With all the different exercises available, we can create an infinite number of routine combinations. To avoid wasting time, you should follow a workout plan created by professionals backed by scientific results. Check out the <a href="https://vshred.com/programs/clean-bulk-program?ref=programs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">90-Day Clean Bulk</a> program by V Shred. It&#8217;s a proven bulking program used by<span style="font-size: 1rem;"> many clients worldwide.</span></p>
<h3>How to Start Strength Training</h3>
<p><!-- instagram error: invalid instagram resource --></p>
<p>Contrary to popular belief, strength training isn’t restricted to experienced gym-goers and fitness buffs. There are plenty of easy strength-training exercises beginners can do at the gym.</p>
<p>The first exercises you should definitely try are deadlifts, bench presses, and squats. Take note that these comprise to make the king of all compound strength-lifting movements.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Deadlift:</strong> <span>To do a deadlift, you lift a loaded bar off the ground until it&#8217;s up above your knees then lower it back down</span>. It’s an exercise that targets your legs while strengthening your lower back.</li>
<li><strong>Bench Press:</strong> The bench press is probably a favorite among many gym rats. By doing the bench press, <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/12-best-chest-exercises-you-should-be-doing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">you&#8217;re targeting your pecs</a> while exercising your lats, triceps, biceps, and even quads.</li>
<li><strong>Squats:</strong> We cannot stress how important it is to <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/leg-day-workout-done-at-home-bodyweight-only/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">never skip leg day</a>. Building a strong pair of legs is important for both form and function. Squats exercise your hams and glutes with a focus on your quads.</li>
</ul>
<h3>What Is a Rep in Strength Training?</h3>
<p>A rep or repetition is one complete motion of an exercise. For example, one rep of a deadlift is when you lift the loaded bar up past your knees and successfully lower it back to the ground.</p>
<h3>What Are Sets in Strength Training?</h3>
<p>A set is the cluster of consecutive reps. Take note that the number of reps in a set depends on what the exercise is and what your fitness goals are. Gym-goers use the words sets and reps to measure the intensity and duration of an exercise.</p>
<h3>Benefits of Strength Training</h3>
<p><!-- instagram error: invalid instagram resource --></p>
<p>Strength training offers multiple health, psychological, and physiological benefits. Some of these include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lower body fat levels</li>
<li>Leaner muscles</li>
<li>Increased energy</li>
<li>Boosted strength</li>
<li>Prevents many diseases</li>
<li>Improves health</li>
<li>Enhances mood</li>
<li>Lowers stress</li>
</ul>
<h3>How to Strength Train at Home</h3>
<p><!-- instagram error: invalid instagram resource --></p>
<p>Do you often stay at home? Strength training can still be an option for you. Most people are under the misconception that you need to be at a gym to workout.</p>
<p>However, there are actually plenty of at-home weight-training programs you can do, both with and without weights. If you have the budget, it may be more efficient to invest in a good set of workout equipment.</p>
<p>If you don’t have the equipment yet, you can start by doing bodyweight exercises and calisthenics. Once they become too easy for you, you can amp it up by doing some variations on how you execute them.</p>
<h3>Weight Training for Women at Home</h3>
<p><!-- instagram error: invalid instagram resource --></p>
<p>To maximize the results of your workout, you need a routine designed to suit your specific needs and goals. For example, women and men have different needs in order to achieve their goals. Women can’t follow a male-centered routine and expect results.</p>
<p>Female gym rats looking for a solid fitness program should check out <a href="https://vshred.com/sp/custom-training-and-diet-plan-8-week-f/sku_BQR5AzD0pv4obg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Customized Diet and Training Plan for Her</a> by V Shred. It’s a comprehensive program that tells you what to eat, what to lift, and when to exercise.</p>

<p><strong>What is strength training and how is it different from bodybuilding? Check out our video to find out:</strong></p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='1170' height='659' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/H3Y-fZHcFT8?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></p>
<p>What is strength training? It’s any exercise where your body moves against an external force or resistance. The key to achieving your fitness goals is consistency. Make it a habit to do at least 30 to 60 minutes worth of exercise every day. Remember: slow and steady wins the race.</p>

]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With all the workout plans for weight loss available online, how do you know which one to follow? It can be difficult to separate effective programs from scams. Luckily, we’ve narrowed the list down to our favorite VShred weight-loss programs backed by scientific evidence and actual results. Check out these workout plans below to see which one fits your goals.</p>
<h2>Top 7 Effective Workout Plans for Weight Loss</h2>
<h3>1. Fat Loss Extreme for Him</h3>
<p><!-- instagram error: invalid instagram resource --></p>
<p>This workout regimen is exactly what it sounds like. Fat Loss Extreme for Him is specifically designed for men who want to drop 20+ lbs. of excess fat as soon as possible.</p>
<p>This<a href="https://vshred.com/programs/fat-loss-extreme?ref=programs" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> step-by-step blueprint</a> is everything you need to finally shed fat and reveal your well-sculpted muscles. Plus, it’s very simple to follow!</p>
<p>It’s a plan tailored for men like you. Just lift what we tell you to lift and eat what we tell you to eat.</p>
<h3>2. Fat Loss Extreme for Her</h3>
<p>While other weight-loss plans designed for women tell you to starve yourself and spend countless hours on the treadmill, <a href="https://vshred.com/sp/fat-loss-extreme-f/sku_CKcwR4TEg54IeG?ref=programs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fat Loss Extreme for Her</a> is different. If you’re tired of back-breaking crunches, boring treadmill sessions, and expensive cleansing diets, then we have what you’re looking for.</p>
<p>This workout plan guides you every step of the way. It tells you what to eat, what to lift, and when to rest. Unlike other plans, we’re telling you right now that this plan won’t force you to buy expensive detox juices or run for two hours on the treadmill.</p>
<p>It consists of short, explosive workouts, that you can do from home, specifically designed to stimulate weight-loss among female athletes and fitness enthusiasts alike.</p>
<h3>3. Ripped in 90 Days</h3>
<p><!-- instagram error: invalid instagram resource --></p>
<p>If you’re bulking, you need to consume more calories and do heavy exercises. Meanwhile, athletes trying to cut down on weight should focus on light, high-repetition exercises while minimizing their calorie intake.</p>
<p>This is what makes it almost impossible to build a muscular body while shredding fat. Luckily, V Shred offers a program designed to help you lose fat while packing on muscle mass.</p>
<p><a href="https://vshred.com/sp/ripped-in-90-days/sku_AR6nTj3PTK3uu9?ref=programs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ripped in 90 Days</a> is a workout plan that tells you exactly what to eat and how many calories you need to consume.</p>
<p>At the same time, it tells you what exercises to do on a specific day of the week. All you need to do is commit to the program and you’ll start seeing results almost immediately.</p>
<h3>4. Toned in 90 Days</h3>
<p>The truth is, not everyone wants to pack on heavy muscle mass. Most women aim for a tight, lean body. Sadly, most workout plans that promise this are simply the same starvation diets slapped with a different brand.</p>
<p>If you’re looking for something different, then <a href="https://vshred.com/sp/toned-in-90-days/v1/?ref=programs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Toned in 90 Days</a> is perfect for you! It’s one of the best workout plans for weight loss that helps you lose fat without losing muscle.</p>
<p>It not only helps you lose weight, but it also makes you leaner and stronger.</p>
<h3>5. Six-Pack Shred</h3>
<p><!-- instagram error: invalid instagram resource --></p>
<p>Are you tired of the generic ab-workout programs that do nothing but force you to do thousands of back-breaking sit-ups? The truth is, all those crunches won’t do anything unless they&#8217;re combined with other strength-training exercises and proper nutrition.</p>
<p><a href="https://vshred.com/sp/six-pack-shred/v1/?ref=programs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Six-Pack Shred</a> is a program designed to help you shred enough fat to get visible abs in just 12 weeks if you follow this plan.</p>
<h3>6. Customized Diet and Training Plan for Her</h3>
<p>Personal trainers or nutritionists are there to help athletes achieve their dream body faster than they could on their own. They create specialized diet and workout plans for weight loss which you can use.</p>
<p>However, they charge hundreds of dollars per session and it’s not practical for the average female gym-goer to hire one. Luckily, you don’t need to spend thousands of dollars just to get your dream body.</p>
<p><a href="https://vshred.com/sp/custom-training-and-diet-plan-8-week-f/sku_BQR5AzD0pv4obg?ref=programs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Customized Diet and Training Plan for Her</a> is like a personal trainer that tells you exactly what you need to do every single day with unlimited support and weekly adjustments. The main difference is it doesn’t cost nearly as much as a personal trainer would.</p>
<h3>7. Customized Diet and Training Plan for Him</h3>
<p><!-- instagram error: invalid instagram resource --></p>
<p>If you want to make any real progress with your body, ditch the generic workout routines you previously bought. V Shred understands that different people have varying needs. This means that while a workout routine may be effective for us, it doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean they&#8217;re effective for you as well.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why we created the <a href="https://vshred.com/programs/custom-training-and-diet-plan-8-week?ref=programs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Customized Diet and Training Plan for Him</a>. It&#8217;s a customized nutrition and workout guide where we give you plans tailored especially for you. It&#8217;s loaded with all the workout routines and diet plans you need to follow for the next coming weeks.</p>
<p>Think of it as hiring a personal trainer you have access to 24/7. Except with us, you won&#8217;t be spending nearly as much as you would have with an actual trainer.</p>
<p><strong>Check out this 12-minute fat-burning workout plan on V Shred:</strong></p>

]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Getting bigger arms is not the easiest task. But if you’re looking to finally accomplish this seemingly massive goal, you need to be incorporating the best bicep workout fix! This simple adjustment will make all the difference!</p>
<div class="embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9 mb-5">
<!-- iframe plugin v.4.4 wordpress.org/plugins/iframe/ -->
<iframe src="//youtube.com/embed/NkIGBCR_pG0" class="embed-responsive-item box-shadow-wide" width="100%" height="500" scrolling="yes" frameborder="0"></iframe>
</div>
<div></div>
<p class="p1">Bigger arms is one of the most sought out goals when it comes to fitness. But actually getting your biceps to fill out your sleeves and get those veins sticking out is easier said than done.</p>
<h4 class="p1">If you’re ready to say goodbye to the struggles of small arm land and build serious bicep muscle, it’s time to put down the muscle magazines, <a href="https://vshred.com/sp/survey/survey-aka1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">learn your body type with this free body type quiz</a> and start doing the best bicep workout fix today!</h4>
<p class="p1">This workout fix is great for any kind of bicep exercise, such as dumbbells curls, cable curls, EZ bar curls, etc. But in this video, I will be using the face curl for my example.</p>
<p class="p1">The reason I am using the face curl is because the face curl is a great way to target the “peak” of the bicep. This is also known as the “short head” of the bicep muscle.</p>
<h2 class="p1">The Best Bicep Workout Mistake</h2>
<p class="p1">You see, the biggest mistake you can make when doing bicep exercises, is going too heavy. By going too heavy, you are preventing yourself from achieving full range of motion.</p>
<p class="p1">But this is not to say you’re not getting the full stretch of the muscle. That part is no problem. All you have to do is let the weight straighten your arm.</p>
<p class="p1">Instead, you are not able to get the “peak” contraction of the muscle because you can’t properly lift it all the way up.</p>
<h3 class="p1">The Best Bicep Workout Fix</h3>
<p class="p1">In order to correct years of doing this on accident, you can simply incorporate a bicep curl additive to achieve this “peak” contraction.</p>
<p class="p1">To do this, you will do, what I call, the “triple-pump bicep curl”. This is when you set up into bicep curl position and using a lighter weight you will curl the weight towards you.</p>
<p class="p1">Now instead of lowering the weight back down to the original starting position, you will go half-way down and curl back up. You will repeat this 2 more times and then lower it all the way down.</p>
<p class="p1">Therefore, you will have curled the weight all the way up, gotten the “peak” contraction four times, and fully extended the muscle by lowering the weight all the way back down.</p>
<h4 class="p1">The Conclusion</h4>
<p class="p1">If you are someone who has struggled with packing on bicep muscle, it very well could be because you’re not getting the full range of motion. So by incorporating the “triple-pump bicep curl” you will put extra emphasis on the “peak” contraction, allowing for more gains!</p>
<p class="p1">Try this out and be sure to share this with a friend who needs bigger arms!</p>
<p class="p1">Also, comment down below what your best bicep workout fix is! I’m excited to hear from you!</p>

<p><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='1170' height='659' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/4YVT_SveWo4?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></p>
<p class="p1">But in order to build lean muscle, you need to know what body type you are. <a href="https://vshred.com/sp/survey/survey-aka1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Take this free body type quiz that tells you exactly what to do to get in shape fast!</a></p>
<p class="p1">Truth is, there are tons of upper body workouts scattering the internet. So how are you supposed to know which ones will actually work?</p>
<p class="p1">Whether an upper body workout is effective or not will come down to three things:</p>
<ol>
<li class="p1">Does it hit all the different muscle groups in your upper body?</li>
<li class="p1">Do you have proper form?</li>
<li class="p1">Is it an easy workout to do?</li>
</ol>
<p class="p1">Meaning, you need to hit your back, chest, shoulders, biceps and triceps all in one. You need to do all the exercises correctly. And you need to be able to do the workout without spending hours and hours in the gym.</p>
<p class="p1">That’s why this is better than the other upper body workouts that you’ve tried. It does all three and more!</p>
<p class="p1">This upper body workout will be three supersets (two exercises performed back to back), targeting all the different muscles groups. And it will only consist of resistance band exercises. Which makes it possible to do at home or even while traveling!</p>
<h2 class="p1">The Upper Body Workouts Layout</h2>
<ul>
<li class="p1">3 supersets</li>
<li class="p1">4 sets</li>
<li class="p1">10-12 reps per set</li>
<li class="p1">1 minute of rest between each set</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="p1">The Exercises:</h3>
<h4 class="p1">Low Banded Row Superset &amp; Banded Bicep Curls</h4>
<p class="p1">Start off by sitting on the ground with your feet straight out in front of you. From there, you will hook the band in the arch of your foot. Then grab the band near your feet and sit back into a 90 degree position with your arms straight out in front of you. You will then focus on driving your elbows back in-line with your belly button and return back to starting position. Repeat for 10-12 reps and go straight into your curls.</p>
<p class="p1">After that, you will get up and stand on the band. Grabbing the handles you will place your feet width depending on how difficult you want the curl to be. Then, keeping your elbows in the same position throughout, curl the weight all the weight up, and return back down slowly. Repeat for 10-12 reps and then rest for a minute. Then do 3 more sets.</p>
<h4 class="p1">Banded Pushup Superset &amp; Overhead Tricep Extensions</h4>
<p class="p1">Here, you will wrap the band around your back and grab it wherever is best fit for your capabilities. After picking your arm width, you will get into push-up position with your hands pressing down on top of the bands. Keeping the band wrapped around your lower shoulders, go down and do a regular pushup. Keep your shoulders rolled back and focus on driving your elbows together to engage your chest. Repeat for 10-12 reps and go straight into tricep extensions.</p>
<p class="p1">For the tricep extensions, you will sit on the band and lift it up over your head. Grab it wherever is best fit for your capabilities and elevate your elbows. From there, keeping your elbows in the same spot, drive your hands up, squeezing your triceps. Once your arms are straight, lower your hands until you are just past a 90 degree angle and go into the next rep. Repeat for 10-12 reps and rest for a minute. Then do 3 more sets and move into the final superset.</p>
<h4 class="p1">Shoulder Press Superset &amp; Lateral Raises</h4>
<p class="p1">For this exercise, you will start standing with the band under your feet. You will want to keep your feet together so that the exercise is not too difficult to perform properly. From there, you want to slightly bring your elbows forward, then push the handles up and together at the top. Then lower your arms until your elbows are just past 90 degrees and go into your next rep. Repeat for 10-12 reps and go straight into lateral raises.</p>
<p class="p1">For this exercise you will continue to stand on the resistance band. But instead of pressing the handles up, we are going to start with our arms down by our side and press the handles outward. By focusing on pressing outward, rather than raising up, you will engage less of your trap muscle to help with better isolation of the delt. Raise until your hands are shoulders level and return your arms back down to your side. Repeat for 10-12 reps, do 3 more sets and you’re done with the workout!</p>

<p class="p1">Everyone loves arm day, that’s just a fact. But have you ever gone to the gym to hit arms and found it to be too busy to get the dumbbells you need?</p>
<p class="p1">If that’s ever happened to you.. or if you’re just looking for new arm workouts.. here’s one that you can do using one cable pulley only.</p>
<p class="p1">For this workout, we will start with triceps seeing as how they take up the largest portion of your upper arms. The workout will be 4 exercises and we will be doing 3 sets of 10 for each.</p>
<h2 class="p1">Arm Workouts For You</h2>
<h3 class="p1">Rope Extensions</h3>
<p class="p1">For this exercise, you will put the pulley to the top and take a step back from it. By taking a step back, you allow a better contraction at the bottom of the exercise. Start with your elbows down to your side and at a 90 degree angle. From there, you will keep your elbows in the same spot and push the weight down, squeezing your triceps. After full extension, return back to the 90 degree angle with your elbows. Repeat for 3 sets of 10.</p>
<h3 class="p1">Straight Bar Overhead Extensions</h3>
<p class="p1">Here, you will use a straight or EZ bar and put it to the top height. From there, you will elevate your elbows and bring your elbows out to a 90 degree angle above your head. Then, using your triceps, you will extend your arms fully.. and return back to starting position. Repeat for 3 sets of 10.</p>
<h3 class="p1">EZ Bar Extensions</h3>
<p class="p1">For these, you will still use the EZ bar the top of the pulley. Using the inner grip, you will keep your elbows tucked into your side and start with your elbows at a 90 degree angle. Extend your arms fully and return back to starting position. Repeat for 3 sets of 10.</p>
<h3 class="p1">Single Arm Extensions Pause Reps</h3>
<p class="p1">Here, you will replace the bar with a single handle. Put your elbow into place by tucking it into your side. From there, extend your arm fully and squeeze it at full extension for 3 seconds. Repeat for 10 reps with a 3 second hold with each arm for 3 sets.</p>
<h3 class="p1">Rope Curls</h3>
<p class="p1">First, you’ll attach the rope to the cable and put it to the bottom. From there, grab the rope and step a half step back from the cable. Keeping your back straight up and down, curl the weight up and return back to starting position. Repeat for 3 sets of 10.</p>
<h3 class="p1">EZ Bar Knee Curls</h3>
<p class="p1">For this exercise, you will attach a straight bar or EZ bar. From there, you will grab the bar, take two steps back and squat down until your elbows are resting on your knees in front of you. Then, you will curl the weight as if doing a preacher curl and return back to starting position. Repeat for 3 sets of 10.</p>
<h3 class="p1">Pronated EZ Bar Curls</h3>
<p class="p1">Here, you will grab the EZ bar on the outside with your palms facing down. Put your elbows in by your side and curl the handle up as you keep your elbows in the same spot. Repeat for 3 sets of 10.</p>
<h3 class="p1">EZ Bar Curl Negatives</h3>
<p class="p1">For this exercise, you will focus on the eccentric/negative contraction of the exercise. So put the weight a little heavier than usual and you will actually cheat the weight up. Start by bending over and explode through your glutes to create momentum to get the weight up. Then squeeze the weight at the top and lower the weight slowly. Aim for a 10 second negative contraction. Repeat for 3 sets of 8.</p>
<p class="p1">Throw this in your routine of arm workouts twice a week if you want bigger arms. Focus on the form and make sure your nutrition is taken care of so you get the fastest results possible.</p>
