<p>Since the sun is finally shining brighter and temperatures are rising a bit, we want to encourage you to<em><strong> take some of your workouts OUTDOORS!</strong></em></p>
<p>Lack of motivation is one of the biggest reasons people skip training. There&#8217;s nothing quite like surrounding yourself with nature and breathing in some fresh air. It is the perfect motivator to get you moving!</p>
<p>Being outdoors helps lower stress, clears your mind, improves happiness, and according to some studies, can even up your calorie burn a little bit!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>Put on some SPF, pound some <a href="https://sculptnation.com/products/pre-workout" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pre-workout</a> to help you push through, </strong></em><br />
<em><strong>head outside to a nice even spot in the grass, and follow along for this</strong></em><br />

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you wanna lose that belly fat and get ripped six pack abs, you don&#8217;t need to hire an expensive personal trainer or go to the gym. All you need to do is get a dumbbell and follow these workout routines!</p>
<h2>Weighted Ab Workout For A Ripped Six Pack Abs</h2>
<h3></h3>
<h3>Start With Your Gut</h3>
<p><!-- instagram error: invalid instagram resource --></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">When it comes to getting ripped six pack abs, there’s one thing you should not overlook. Diet. So before you try this workout, if you’re not sure <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/healthy-eating-mistakes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">what you should be eating</a> in order to really chisel your abs, take my free body type quiz to learn the 3 most important things to do to see results.</span></p>
<div>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://vshred.com/sp/survey/survey-aka1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="s1">Click Here To Take The Free Body Type Quiz!</span></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Once your <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/healthy-eating-mistakes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">dietary concerns</a> are out of the way, it’s time to train those abs! Abs are just like any other muscle group, but smaller than most. That means you need to train them and let them recover just like any other muscle. So we recommend doing this weighted ab workout no more than every other day making sure to allow your abdominal muscles to recover completely.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">All you will need for this workout is a single dumbbell. You may pick the weight of your choice or use no weight at all (this depends on your physical capability) and do as follows:</span></p>
<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1">The Workout</span></h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There are four total exercises and for each exercise, you will do 4 sets of 10-15 reps with only 20 seconds of rest in-between. If you cannot handle this layout, you may extend your rest period slightly or break the sets into “mini sets” but make sure to complete the same total number of reps.</span></p>
<h3><span class="s1">Dumbbell Straight-Arm Crunches</span></h3>
<p><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/3ksxlaN8sLsKFMri0P"><img src="https://i0.wp.com/media.giphy.com/media/3ksxlaN8sLsKFMri0P/giphy.gif?resize=480%2C270&#038;ssl=1" alt="Animated GIF - Find &amp; Share on GIPHY" width="480" height="270" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In this abs routine, you’re going to lay flat on your back with your knees bent. Hold the dumbbell out straight above you and continue to push the dumbbell straight towards the ceiling as you crunch.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">4 sets of 10-15 reps. </span></p>
<h3><span class="s1">Dumbbell Reverse Crunches</span></h3>
<p><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/B1SY1kmjV1yVAJcbpJ"><img src="https://i2.wp.com/media.giphy.com/media/B1SY1kmjV1yVAJcbpJ/giphy.gif?resize=480%2C270&#038;ssl=1" alt="Animated GIF - Find &amp; Share on GIPHY" width="480" height="270" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Lay flat on your back again for this one but this time, place a dumbbell between your feet with your knees completely bent and thighs pointing straight up. Hold on to the dumbbell with your feet and bring your legs up toward your chest making sure your lower back gets off the ground. Focus on using your abs to pull your legs up and not getting momentum from your knees or feet. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">4 sets of 10-15 reps.</span></p>
<h3><span class="s1">Rotating Mountain Climbers</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For this one, get into a regular push-up position. Now, similar to mountain climbers, you will be driving your knees upward but will also do a twist as you do so. So you drive your knees to your opposite elbow as you twist your core.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">4 sets of 10-15 reps each way.</span></p>
<h3><span class="s1">Dumbbell Woodchops</span></h3>
<p><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/uANrWMqcPO9s62VFoZ"><img src="https://i0.wp.com/media.giphy.com/media/uANrWMqcPO9s62VFoZ/giphy.gif?resize=480%2C270&#038;ssl=1" alt="Animated GIF - Find &amp; Share on GIPHY" width="480" height="270" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Stand with a single dumbbell held by both hands and start off by turning your shoulders completely to one side, keeping the dumbbell low. Rotate your shoulders to the opposite side as you raise the dumbbell up high above your head in the process. Focus on engaging your core with the twists.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">4 sets of 10-15 each way.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">These core exercises, </span>as well as other <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/workout-plans-weight-loss/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">fat burning workouts</a>,<span style="font-size: 1rem;">will h</span>elp you get six pack abs and lead a healthier, more active life.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Get rid of belly fat fast with these practical and effective tips you can follow today.</p>
<h2>17 Effective Tips to Get Rid of Belly Fat Fast</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>1. Do More HIIT Exercises</h3>
<p><!-- instagram error: invalid instagram resource --></p>
<p>Does running burn belly fat? The answer: yes. Running and other cardiovascular activities are great exercises to burn belly fat.</p>
<p>One of the best ways how to burn belly fat is to incorporate some cardio routines into your workout plan. But keep in mind not every cardio movement is ideal for bodybuilding purposes.</p>
<p>Instead of running 5 km/h on a treadmill, opt to do quick, explosive sprints. High-intensity interval exercises tend to burn both fat and muscle mass.</p>
<p>If you want to maintain a fit, strong, and sexy body, you need to do quick, explosive <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/hiit-workout-plan-burn-calories-in-4-minutes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HIIT workouts</a> that burn stubborn belly fat and build lean muscle mass at the same time.</p>
<h3>2. Ditch the Junk</h3>
<p>Potato chips, fries, chocolate bars, and fizzy drinks are just some of the junk you need to cut out from your diet if you want to burn belly fat fast.</p>
<p>These junk foods are high in calories and offer zero nutritional value. There’s no way to reduce belly fat without at least cutting back on these junk.</p>
<p>But if you can’t completely remove these foods from your diet, don’t worry! The next best way to lose stomach fat is to replace these snacks with healthier options.</p>
<p>For example, instead of eating a bag of potato crisps, make your own zucchini chips instead. Search for healthy food options you can use to replace your common daily snacks.</p>
<h3>3. Drink More Water</h3>
<p>Whether your goal is to lose belly fat, build muscle, or improve athletic strength, it’s very important to stay hydrated 24/7.</p>
<p>Drinking water is a solid way to remove toxins from your body. If these toxins pile up in your body, losing belly fat will be the least of your problems.</p>
<p>Too many toxins in the body may lead to constipation, bloating, and even certain diseases. Aim to drink 8 to 10 glasses of water for optimal performance.</p>
<h3>4. Make Healthier Food Choices</h3>
<p>Doing the best exercises to burn belly fat is not enough to trim down your waistline. Remember: you sculpt muscles in the gym and lose fat in the kitchen.</p>
<p>The best way to burn belly fat is to combine regular core exercises with a healthy, well-balanced diet. All your hard work at the gym won’t mean anything if you don’t feed your muscles with the right nutrients.</p>
<p>Some of the foods that burn belly fat include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Almonds</li>
<li>Berries</li>
<li>Fatty Fish</li>
<li>Eggs</li>
<li>Chili Peppers</li>
<li>Veggies</li>
<li>Oranges</li>
<li>Avocado</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> These are just some of the belly-fat-burners men and women can eat. Feel free to explore other natural food choices. Overall, it’s best to avoid artificially sourced snacks and foods. Stick to natural, healthy, and nutritious options.</p>
<h3>5. Cut Back on Carbs</h3>
<p>Many seasoned fitness buffs swear that the best way to burn belly fat is to cut back on carbs –and it’s true!</p>
<p>The body only burns about 6% to 8% of calories per gram of carbs. Meanwhile, the body burns 25% to 30% of calories per gram of protein.</p>
<p>That means you cut back on around 41 grams of calories if you eat 50 grams of protein instead of carbs. Keep this in mind while you’re making your personal diet plan to follow.</p>
<p>Opt to source your energy from alternative nutrients such as healthy fats, minerals, and of course, protein.</p>
<p><strong>Important:</strong> You don&#8217;t have to completely cut carbs from your diet. In fact, you need to know the best times of the day to <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/best-times-eat-carbs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">eat your carbs</a>.</p>
<h3>6. Start Meal Prepping</h3>
<p><!-- instagram error: invalid instagram resource --></p>
<p>One reason people forego eating healthy is because organic products usually cost more than artificially sourced foods do. That’s because organic food choices have a much shorter shelf life.</p>
<p>As a result, companies can’t produce too much stock since a lot of it might simply go to waste. However, there is a way to eat healthy, natural choices without denting your pocket: <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/how-to-meal-prep-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">meal prepping</a>.</p>
<p>It’s the best way to lose belly fat through healthy dieting without spending too much money on natural and organic food brands. The main point is to prepare your meals hours or even days ahead of time.</p>
<p>Do your grocery shopping, set aside a few hours to cook your meals, and then refrigerate them. This’ll also force you to forego eating junk food since you already have your packed meals with you.</p>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> Don’t worry if you don’t have a knack for cooking. Opt to follow V Shred’s <a href="https://vshred.com/sp/recipe-guide/v1/?ref=programs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">healthy recipe guide</a>. It consists of multiple delicious, healthy, easy-to-follow recipes any fitness buff can follow.</p>
<h3>7. Lay Off the Booze</h3>
<p>It’s no secret that an effective way how to burn belly fat for men and women is to cut back on alcoholic drinks.</p>
<p>A single bottle of beer already has around 150 calories. Count how many bottles you chug on a typical Friday night and multiply it by 150; that’s how many calories you consume during a night out.</p>
<p>You don’t have to completely abstain from booze. In fact, some studies suggest that a few occasional drinks may even be good for the health.</p>
<p>But what you should do is stop binge drinking every single weekend. It adds inches to your waist and kills your gains.</p>
<h3>8. Ditch the Salad Dressing</h3>
<p>Plenty of fitness buffs who want to get rid of belly fat choose to eat salads. But keep in mind that this healthy choice means nothing if you’re topping it with calorie-filled pre-packaged salad dressings.</p>
<p>The best way how to lose belly fat fast with salads is to top it off with vinaigrette dressing instead. Apart from having lesser calories, acidic fluids stimulate the fat-burning process.</p>
<p>Plus, they help remove water weight, constipation, and bloating. If you want to achieve a lean, shredded six-pack try to include vinegar into your diet.</p>
<h3>9. Start Keeping Track of Your Calories</h3>
<p>We cannot stress how important it is to keep track of your calories when dieting. To lose some pounds, you need to start calculating exactly how much you eat.</p>
<p>If you want to get rid of belly fat fast, you have to decrease your daily calorie intake. At the same time, you need to increase the number of calories you burn every day.</p>
<p>The average male needs to eat 1,500 calories if they want to drop their body fat percentage. Meanwhile, women can only consume 1,000 calories per day if they want to trim a few inches off their waist.</p>
<h3>10. Do Various Abdominal Exercises</h3>
<p>Crunches are good ab exercises, but they’re not the only workouts you need to do. Your ab-sculpting regimen should consist of different moves that hit your torso from all different angles.</p>
<p>Try to incorporate exercises that hit your lower, middle, and upper abs respectively. For example, if you’re looking for moves on how to lose fat in your<a href="https://vshred.com/blog/how-to-lose-lower-belly-fat/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> lower abs</a>, you can opt to bust out some hanging leg raises.</p>
<p>Overall, what’s important is to create a complete abs workout with different moves and exercises to sculpt your torso from all angles.</p>
<h3>11. Start Lifting Weights</h3>
<p>Running on your gym’s treadmill for hours on end is not the best way how to burn belly fat. If you want to sculpt a strong, solid core, you need to start doing some resistance training.</p>
<p>It’s very important to include <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/strength-training/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">compound strength-training moves</a> such as the bench press, deadlift, and squat into your regimen.</p>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> Even if your main goal is to get rid of belly fat, it’s not practical to do ab exercises every single day of the week. Like any other muscle group, you only need to work your abs out around two to three times a week.</p>
<h3>12. Lower Your Stress Levels</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-5445 size-full" src="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/man-doing-yoga-on-mat-near-glass-balcony-fence-get-rid-of-belly-fat-px.jpg?resize=625%2C400&#038;ssl=1" alt="Lower Your Stress Levels | The Most Effective Ways to Get Rid of Belly Fat Fast" width="625" height="400" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/man-doing-yoga-on-mat-near-glass-balcony-fence-get-rid-of-belly-fat-px.jpg?w=625&amp;ssl=1 625w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/man-doing-yoga-on-mat-near-glass-balcony-fence-get-rid-of-belly-fat-px.jpg?resize=300%2C192&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>If you want to get rid of belly fat, make sure to be mindful of the stress you put on yourself.</p>
<p>You may not notice it, but stress has a negative effect on both your mind and body. Apart from the strain it places on your mental health, it also promotes the production of the stress hormone, cortisol.</p>
<p>High cortisol levels tend to increase your appetite and stimulate the storage of fat in your abdomen. Women should especially be careful of their stress levels since they already have high amounts of cortisol.</p>
<p>To reduce your stress, try engaging in mentally and spiritually relaxing activities such as yoga, stretching, and meditation. Doing these simple, short activities are a great way to lower your stress levels.</p>
<h3>13. Move Around More Often</h3>
<p>Simple movements such as taking the stairs, walking around the office, and stretching every few hours can go a long way in helping you get rid of belly fat.</p>
<p>Sedentary people tend to accumulate more fat in their belly. Plus, their muscles don’t get sufficient blood and oxygen to recover properly.</p>
<p>What you can do is to stand up from your desk for a few minutes after every couple of hours of work. If you have the time, you can try to squeeze in some <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/abs-workout-home/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">quick abdominal workouts</a> during your lunch break.</p>
<p>Remember: the key here is to get the blood flowing and muscles moving as much as you can. It doesn’t matter when or where.</p>
<h3>14. Start Keeping Track of Your Record</h3>
<p>A solid way how to lose belly fat is to force yourself beyond your comfort zone. You can do this by keeping track of your personal record when performing different exercises to burn belly fat.</p>
<p>For example, if you usually cover five kilometers in 30 minutes, try to ramp it up by challenging yourself to cover the same distance faster. Similarly, you can opt to increase the reps of your burpees, crunches, or sit-ups every month or so.</p>
<p>This is effective because the body naturally adapts to the level of stress we put on it. After a few weeks, it won’t be as difficult to bust out 20 burpees anymore.</p>
<p>Variation ensures your body doesn’t adapt too quickly to the exercises you regularly perform. This means you’re constantly challenging your body to work harder and stronger every time you work out.</p>
<h3>15. Do Resistance Training Before Cardio</h3>
<p>Many fitness buffs struggle whether they should perform cardio before or after a workout. If your goal is to get rid of belly fat fast, then opt to perform it after you do resistance training.</p>
<p>This’ll help you focus all your strength on lifting more sets of heavy weights. At the same time, your body will have a harder time doing your cardio routine since you’re already tired.</p>
<p>Doing so will force your body to work twice as hard during your cardio session even if you’re doing your regular routine.</p>
<h3>16. Follow a Scientifically Proven Plan</h3>
<p>Remember that there’s no one-size-fits-all plan on how to <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/get-six-pack/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reduce belly fat</a>.</p>
<p>You can opt to create your own abs regimen by gathering the different core exercises online. Similarly, you can subscribe to a brand that offers a fitness plan consisting of the most effective tips and exercises on how to lose stomach fat.</p>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> If you want to know the secret how to burn belly fat fast, get V Shred’s <a href="https://vshred.com/sp/six-pack-shred/v1/?ref=programs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Six-Pack Shred</a> program. It’s a scientifically proven fitness plan that helps dedicated gym-goers sculpt a strong, shredded six-pack in just a few weeks.</p>
<h3>17. Just Do It</h3>

<p>What’s important is to push yourself to take the first step –no matter how small it is. Whether it’s a gym membership, fitness plan subscription, or healthier meal plan, what matters is you took the initiative to achieve your goal.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>V Shred is hosting a 30-day fitness challenge for people who want to prove their dedication to fitness. Here are the things you need to know.</p>
<h2>30-Day Fitness Challenge | What You Should Know</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>What Is the 30-Day Fitness Challenge?</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://vshred.com/contest" target="_blank" rel="noopener">30-day workout challenge</a> is a contest to see which participants can shed off the most body fat in a limited amount of time. If you think you have what it takes to break plateaus and reach newer heights, then this challenge is for you.</p>
<h3>Who Can Join the 30-Day Fitness Challenge?</h3>
<p>There are no requirements to join our 30-day fitness challenge. Male or female, young or old, obese or healthy, everyone is welcome.</p>
<p>Don’t worry about your weight being a problem. In fact, we encourage people with a sedentary lifestyle to sign up. This will be the first step to building a better you.</p>
<p>Also, you don’t need to <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/get-six-pack-3-minutes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sculpt rock-hard washboard abs</a> to win the challenge. V Shred will pick the contestant who made the most improvement throughout the 30-day challenge.</p>
<p>So it doesn’t matter if you don’t have well-sculpted abs by the end of the month. What matters is how many pounds you lose and inches you trim off.</p>
<h3>When Will V Shred’s 30-Day Workout Challenge Start?</h3>
<p>V Shred will start the contest on November 5, 2018, and the deadline for submission of applications is on November 1. The normal entry price is at $250 but you get a special discount if you register earlier.</p>
<h3>Why Should I Join This Challenge?</h3>
<p><!-- instagram error: invalid instagram resource --></p>
<p>At the end of the 30-day contest, V Shred will choose the top-performing athletes who made the best progress and give them a $5,000 cash prize.</p>
<p>However, the cash prize shouldn’t be the main reason for joining the contest. In fact, it should only be an extra nudge to push yourself even further.</p>
<p>The main reason you should join is for self-improvement. It doesn’t matter if you make the most or least drastic change. What matters is you took the first step to improving yourself both as an athlete and as a person.</p>
<p>Not everybody has what it takes to complete the 30-day fitness challenge. The mere fact of being able to finish it is an achievement on its own.</p>
<p>Remember that your opponents in this challenge are not the other contestants. The only person you have to outdo is you.</p>
<h3>Where Can I Do the Challenge?</h3>
<p>You can do the challenge anywhere you want to. Whether you’re on vacation, at home, or in the office, all you’ll need is your body and the willpower to <a href="https://vshred.com/contest" target="_blank" rel="noopener">work out</a>. Just make sure to document your progress throughout the challenge.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Young or old, male or female, everybody wants to know how to get six-pack abs. That’s the reason why there are plenty of workout programs claiming to be the best and fastest way to burn belly fat. However, it still leaves plenty of gym-goers with a lot of questions about ab workouts. Read on to learn everything you need to know about getting that shredded six-pack you’ve always dreamed of.</p>

<h2>FAQ: How to Get Six-Pack Abs the Right Way</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div id="how" class="anchor"></div>
<h3>How to Get Six-Pack Abs?</h3>
<p><!-- instagram error: invalid instagram resource --></p>
<p>If you want your abs to show, you need to burn the fat surrounding your waist while sculpting your abdominal muscles. Maybe the most common mistake gym-goers commit is foregoing diet <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/running-benefits/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">and cardio</a> to focus solely on doing crunches.</p>
<p>It doesn’t matter if you can do 1,000 crunches or 3-minute planks, if there’s a wall of fat surrounding your belly, your abs won’t show. That’s why you need to do a combination of strength-training, <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/ab-workouts-beginners/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">fat-loss workouts</a>, and proper dieting to get six-pack abs.</p>
<div id="can" class="anchor"></div>
<h3>Can You Get Six-Pack Abs in One Month?</h3>
<p>What do most six-pack workout schemes have in common? They promise you abs after a month of training.</p>
<p>Some programs even say you’ll see results in just one week. While it may not be impossible, it’s definitely not the case for most gym-goers.</p>
<p>The truth is, there are no shortcuts to getting six-pack abs. With that in mind, be wary of the ab workout scams that charge you hundreds of dollars.</p>
<div id="get" class="anchor"></div>
<h3>How to Get Six-Pack Abs Without Dieting?</h3>
<p><!-- instagram error: invalid instagram resource --></p>
<p>Simply put, you can’t get six-pack abs without following a healthy diet. You can’t expect to offset the unhealthy snacks you consume by working overtime at the gym.</p>
<p>If you’re serious about getting shredded, you need to put in as much work in the kitchen as you do in the gym. All your efforts working out will go to waste if you don&#8217;t eat properly.</p>
<p>So drop the cookies, chips, chocolates, and sodas and switch to healthier alternatives.</p>
<div id="what" class="anchor"></div>
<h3>What Are Some Good Six-Pack Abs Diets?</h3>
<p>Contrary to popular belief, you don’t need to starve yourself just to lose fat. The general rule when losing fat is to simply burn off more calories than you consume.</p>
<p>Make sure to reduce the gap between the calories you burn and the ones you consume. The lower it is, the faster you’ll burn fat, to an extent.</p>
<p><strong>Pro tip</strong>: If you hate coming up with recipes and counting calories, then you may need some help. Most professional nutritionists charge hundreds of dollars per hour just to give you low-calorie recipes to cook.</p>
<p>However, V Shred can do that for you and it won’t even cost you $15.00. Check out our very own <a href="https://vshred.com/sp/recipe-guide/v1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">recipe guide</a>. We guarantee it’ll be the last dieting guide you’ll ever need.</p>
<div id="best" class="anchor"></div>
<h3>What’s Best Six-Pack Workout Regimen?</h3>
<p><!-- instagram error: invalid instagram resource --></p>
<p>What do most ab-training books have in common? They force you to do an insane amount of reps.</p>
<p>We’ve seen some programs saying you should do thousands of crunches and sit-ups every day. In fact, most of these workout programs are just sit-up variations.</p>
<p>If you really want to burn fat fast and get the six-pack abs you’ve always dreamed of, you need a comprehensive guide on ab workouts and dieting.</p>
<p>Check out our <a href="https://vshred.com/sp/six-pack-shred/v1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Six-pack Shred program</a>. It’s a step-by-step blueprint designed to help you sculpt your abs without failure.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>After learning how to get six-pack abs, it’s time to practice what you’ve learned. It’s time to stop making the common mistakes gym-goers often commit when sculpting abs. However, remember that it doesn’t matter if you know the best techniques to shred and fat-loss. What matters is your drive to commit to your workout regimen and diet programs, no excuses!</p>

]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With all the workout plans for weight loss available online, how do you know which one to follow? It can be difficult to separate effective programs from scams. Luckily, we’ve narrowed the list down to our favorite VShred weight-loss programs backed by scientific evidence and actual results. Check out these workout plans below to see which one fits your goals.</p>
<h2>Top 7 Effective Workout Plans for Weight Loss</h2>
<h3>1. Fat Loss Extreme for Him</h3>
<p><!-- instagram error: invalid instagram resource --></p>
<p>This workout regimen is exactly what it sounds like. Fat Loss Extreme for Him is specifically designed for men who want to drop 20+ lbs. of excess fat as soon as possible.</p>
<p>This<a href="https://vshred.com/programs/fat-loss-extreme?ref=programs" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> step-by-step blueprint</a> is everything you need to finally shed fat and reveal your well-sculpted muscles. Plus, it’s very simple to follow!</p>
<p>It’s a plan tailored for men like you. Just lift what we tell you to lift and eat what we tell you to eat.</p>
<h3>2. Fat Loss Extreme for Her</h3>
<p>While other weight-loss plans designed for women tell you to starve yourself and spend countless hours on the treadmill, <a href="https://vshred.com/sp/fat-loss-extreme-f/sku_CKcwR4TEg54IeG?ref=programs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fat Loss Extreme for Her</a> is different. If you’re tired of back-breaking crunches, boring treadmill sessions, and expensive cleansing diets, then we have what you’re looking for.</p>
<p>This workout plan guides you every step of the way. It tells you what to eat, what to lift, and when to rest. Unlike other plans, we’re telling you right now that this plan won’t force you to buy expensive detox juices or run for two hours on the treadmill.</p>
<p>It consists of short, explosive workouts, that you can do from home, specifically designed to stimulate weight-loss among female athletes and fitness enthusiasts alike.</p>
<h3>3. Ripped in 90 Days</h3>
<p><!-- instagram error: invalid instagram resource --></p>
<p>If you’re bulking, you need to consume more calories and do heavy exercises. Meanwhile, athletes trying to cut down on weight should focus on light, high-repetition exercises while minimizing their calorie intake.</p>
<p>This is what makes it almost impossible to build a muscular body while shredding fat. Luckily, V Shred offers a program designed to help you lose fat while packing on muscle mass.</p>
<p><a href="https://vshred.com/sp/ripped-in-90-days/sku_AR6nTj3PTK3uu9?ref=programs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ripped in 90 Days</a> is a workout plan that tells you exactly what to eat and how many calories you need to consume.</p>
<p>At the same time, it tells you what exercises to do on a specific day of the week. All you need to do is commit to the program and you’ll start seeing results almost immediately.</p>
<h3>4. Toned in 90 Days</h3>
<p>The truth is, not everyone wants to pack on heavy muscle mass. Most women aim for a tight, lean body. Sadly, most workout plans that promise this are simply the same starvation diets slapped with a different brand.</p>
<p>If you’re looking for something different, then <a href="https://vshred.com/sp/toned-in-90-days/v1/?ref=programs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Toned in 90 Days</a> is perfect for you! It’s one of the best workout plans for weight loss that helps you lose fat without losing muscle.</p>
<p>It not only helps you lose weight, but it also makes you leaner and stronger.</p>
<h3>5. Six-Pack Shred</h3>
<p><!-- instagram error: invalid instagram resource --></p>
<p>Are you tired of the generic ab-workout programs that do nothing but force you to do thousands of back-breaking sit-ups? The truth is, all those crunches won’t do anything unless they&#8217;re combined with other strength-training exercises and proper nutrition.</p>
<p><a href="https://vshred.com/sp/six-pack-shred/v1/?ref=programs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Six-Pack Shred</a> is a program designed to help you shred enough fat to get visible abs in just 12 weeks if you follow this plan.</p>
<h3>6. Customized Diet and Training Plan for Her</h3>
<p>Personal trainers or nutritionists are there to help athletes achieve their dream body faster than they could on their own. They create specialized diet and workout plans for weight loss which you can use.</p>
<p>However, they charge hundreds of dollars per session and it’s not practical for the average female gym-goer to hire one. Luckily, you don’t need to spend thousands of dollars just to get your dream body.</p>
<p><a href="https://vshred.com/sp/custom-training-and-diet-plan-8-week-f/sku_BQR5AzD0pv4obg?ref=programs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Customized Diet and Training Plan for Her</a> is like a personal trainer that tells you exactly what you need to do every single day with unlimited support and weekly adjustments. The main difference is it doesn’t cost nearly as much as a personal trainer would.</p>
<h3>7. Customized Diet and Training Plan for Him</h3>
<p><!-- instagram error: invalid instagram resource --></p>
<p>If you want to make any real progress with your body, ditch the generic workout routines you previously bought. V Shred understands that different people have varying needs. This means that while a workout routine may be effective for us, it doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean they&#8217;re effective for you as well.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why we created the <a href="https://vshred.com/programs/custom-training-and-diet-plan-8-week?ref=programs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Customized Diet and Training Plan for Him</a>. It&#8217;s a customized nutrition and workout guide where we give you plans tailored especially for you. It&#8217;s loaded with all the workout routines and diet plans you need to follow for the next coming weeks.</p>
<p>Think of it as hiring a personal trainer you have access to 24/7. Except with us, you won&#8217;t be spending nearly as much as you would have with an actual trainer.</p>
<p><strong>Check out this 12-minute fat-burning workout plan on V Shred:</strong></p>

<p class="p1"><strong><a href="https://vshred.com/sp/survey/survey-aka1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">If you want to speed up your progress while eating foods you love, take this free body type quiz and find out exactly what to do to get in shape!</a></strong></p>
<p class="p1">So you’re looking for an ab workout, eh?</p>
<p class="p1">Truth is, you need one that you’ll consistently do.. because just one workout will not do anything.</p>
<p class="p1">But the fact that this workout requires no equipment and it only takes 4 minutes.. I think you<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>may have found your answer.</p>
<h2 class="p1">Ab Workout Plan for Beginners</h2>
<p class="p1">This ab workout will consist of just 4 exercises. Each of which will be performed for 45 seconds and followed up with a 15 second rest.</p>
<p class="p1">Once all exercises have been completed, the workout is over!</p>
<h3 class="p1">The Exercises:</h3>
<h4 class="p1">Plank Jacks</h4>
<p class="p1">Here, you will start in a plank position with your back flat. From there you will hop your lower body off the ground and spread open your legs. Then land with your legs spread and hop back up and bring your feet together. Repeat this as many times as you can for 45 seconds and rest for 15 seconds.</p>
<h4 class="p1">Heel Taps</h4>
<p class="p1">For there, you will start in regular sit-up position with your arms down to your side. Then you will initiate a crunch and bring your shoulders up off the ground. After that, you will crunch down to one side, bringing your fingers to the heel of your foot. After tapping your heel, return back to the middle and crunch down to the other side. Repeat as many times as possible for 45 seconds and rest for 15 seconds after.</p>
<h4 class="p1">Flutter Kicks</h4>
<p class="p1">For these, you will start by laying flat on your back. Then with your hands under your butt/lower back for low back support, you will lift your legs off the ground. Make sure to keep your knees straight, then kick your feet up and down about a foot each. Continue doing this for 45 seconds, rest for 15 seconds and move into the last exercise.</p>
<h4 class="p1">Floor Wipers</h4>
<p class="p1">For the last exercise, you will start by laying on your back and point your legs up to the sky. Then you will put your arms out straight to the side of you for upper body stabilization. From there you will drop your legs down to one side until it is a few inches off the ground. Then, pulling with your oblique muscle, bring your feet back up to the center. Then do the same to the other side and repeat as many times as possible for 45 seconds and the workout is done!</p>
<p class="p1">So try this workout plan for beginners 2-3 times per week for the next couple weeks! If you like it, make sure you share it and leave your comments below!</p>

<p class="p1"><strong>But in order to get defined lower abs, or even get your abs to show, you need to know what your body type is and create a plan for your goals. <a href="https://vshred.com/sp/survey/survey-aka1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Click here to take this free body type quiz that tells you exactly what to do to get in shape fast!</a></strong></p>
<p class="p1">In today’s society, life can be hectic..</p>
<p class="p1">Whether you’re working, studying for class, taking care of the kids, cleaning around the house, it’s tough to find time to workout.</p>
<p class="p1">But luckily for you, today’s workout will only take you 4 minutes to complete..</p>
<p class="p1">And even though there’s no such thing as “lower abs”, the exercises that we’re going to perform will put extra emphasis on the lower portion of your <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rectus_abdominis_muscle" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">rectus abdominis</a>.</p>
<p class="p1">So follow along as we do this!</p>
<h2 class="p1">Lower Ab Workout</h2>
<p class="p1">For each exercise listed below, we will perform at max intensity for 25 seconds. Then we will follow it up with a 5 second rest and move into the next exercise. We will repeat each exercise twice for a total of 4 minutes and we’ll be done!</p>
<h3 class="p1">The Exercises:</h3>
<h3 class="p1">Straight Leg Press Ups</h3>
<p class="p1">For this exercise, you will start by laying on your back with your legs pointed straight up. From there, you will take your lower body and drive it up as high as you can, engaging the lower part of your core. After that, you will drop your butt back to the ground, and naturally, your legs will drop a little. But avoid allowing your legs to drop down too far. Then go into the next rep. Repeat as many times as you can for 25 seconds.</p>
<h3 class="p1">Lying Sprints</h3>
<p class="p1">Here, you will lay on your back with your arms and legs down straight. From there, you will drive one knee up as high as you can, and also drive your opposite arm up. Then return them back down and do the same with the other leg and arm. Act as if you are sprinting while laying. Repeat as many times as you can for 25 seconds.</p>
<h3 class="p1">Reverse Crunches</h3>
<p class="p1">For this exercise, you’re going to stay on your back but you want to bend your legs and bring your feet up off the ground. Assume a 90 degree angle to with your thighs to the ground. From there, you will put your arms down by your side for stabilization. Then take you knees and drive them up to your chest, making sure your lower back comes off the ground. Then return back to starting position. But do not let your feet touch the ground. Repeat as many times as you can for 25 seconds.</p>
<h3 class="p1">Plank In &amp; Outs</h3>
<p class="p1">Here, you will start in a plank position on your elbows. From there you will tighten your core and while keeping your back and legs straight, walk your feet up by bending at the hips. Walk in as far as you can, then walk them back out until you are back in your plank position. Repeat this as many times as you can for 25 seconds.</p>
<p class="p1">After you have worked your way through all the exercises, repeat them all one more time and you’re done with the workout!</p>

Click here to take our free body type quiz and find out what will work fastest for you now!</strong></a></p>
<p class="p1">Truth is, we all want a good looking six pack.. But having solid oblique definition is a sign you really got your stuff together.</p>
<p class="p1">But you can look almost anywhere and find an oblique workout. So how do you know which is the best to do?</p>
<p class="p1">There actually isn’t one single oblique workout that will be best, seeing as how it’s good to continuously change up your routine. But this one will leave your obliques nice and sore and leaving good in no time at all!</p>
<h2 class="p1">The Oblique Workout</h2>
<p class="p1">For this workout, you are going to do 6 different oblique exercises. For each exercise, you will do 3 sets of 10 with a 30 second rest in-between each set.</p>
<h3 class="p1">Side Plank Hip Raise</h3>
<p class="p1">You’ll start in a side plank position with your feet in a sturdy position. You will then dip your hips down as low as you can, feeling a stretch in your oblique.. then drive your hips up, crunching with your obliques. Repeat for 3 sets of 10 reps to each side.</p>
<h3 class="p1">Floor Wipers</h3>
<p class="p1">Here, you’ll start on the ground with your arms out to the side and legs straight up. From there, you will drop your legs down to the side until just before your feet touch the ground.. Then you will pull your legs back up with your obliques. Then drop them down to the other side and repeat for 10 reps to each side. Do this for 3 sets.</p>
<h3 class="p1">Side Jack Knives</h3>
<p class="p1">For these, you’ll start by laying on your side with your arm against the ground out to the front. From there, using your hip and arm as the point of contact with the ground, you will bring your legs up off the ground and your upper body up off the ground. You will focus on bringing them together while crunching with your obliques. Repeat this for 10 reps to each side for 3 sets.</p>
<h3 class="p1">Side Plank Knee to Elbow</h3>
<p class="p1">Here, you will start in a side plank position again. From there you will reach one arm up as high as you can and then drive your elbow down in front of your body. At the same time, you will drive your knee up as high as you can, meeting in the middle. Repeat for 10 reps to each side and do 3 sets.</p>
<h3 class="p1">Straight Arm Russian Twists</h3>
<p class="p1">These are just like regular Russians twists but instead of bending your arms and twisting, you will keep them straight. This helps with rotation of the shoulders to engage the core more. Do 10 reps to each side for 3 sets.</p>
<h3 class="p1">Straight Leg Side Crunches</h3>
<p class="p1">Here, you will start by laying on your back with your legs straight up. You will then take your arms and crunch up driving your hands to one side of your legs.. Then going back down and crunching the other way. Do this for 10 reps to each side and 3 total sets.</p>
<p class="p1">You don’t need any equipment or anything! Just grab a spot on the floor and let’s do this!</p>
