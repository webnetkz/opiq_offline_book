That is a scary number!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Good thing you found this article because </span><b><i>we aren’t going to let YOU be “most” people! </i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lower temps do not have to equal larger waistlines! You just have to have a plan! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this short read we will &#8230;</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Explain why winter weight gain happens. Knowing why is important if you want to prevent it and the reason is probably not what you think. In fact, it is partially not even your fault!</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tell you why fall/winter is actually the BEST time to start a diet and training plan.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Give you 7 easy pro tips that will help guide you through the next few months. </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You may believe winter weight gain happens because of the holidays. Those extra home cooked meals and holiday parties are certainly a factor. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But </span><b><i>there is a DAILY issue you need to be prepared to fight </i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">if you want to avoid packing on winter pounds.</span></p>
<p><b>WHY YOU REALLY PACK ON POUNDS AFTER LABOR DAY</b></p>
<p><img class="size-large wp-image-7471" src="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_130930953.jpeg?resize=1024%2C512&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="512" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_130930953.jpeg?resize=1024%2C512&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_130930953.jpeg?resize=300%2C150&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_130930953.jpeg?resize=768%2C384&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_130930953.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_130930953.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the spring and summer months, you are given what we call a</span><b> fitness freebie. </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You get a </span><b><i>seasonal motivation boost</i></b> <span style="font-weight: 400;">that doesn’t happen when temperatures start to drop, and you begin to pull out the chunky sweaters and comfy leggings. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not only is the sun shining (which makes you happier because of Vitamin D), you are wearing LESS clothing in the summer months. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I don’t know about you, but knowing I’m going to be exposing more skin makes walking in the gym a little easier. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Covering up in layers, no doubt leads to the temptation to slack on body goals! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Knowing your arms, legs, and abs will be less exposed can easily be an excuse to slack. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, being layered up often means you don’t SEE the extra pounds, so they are easier to ignore.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But there is more to it than being bundled up….</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-7477" src="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_236518834.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_236518834.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_236518834.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_236518834.jpeg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_236518834.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_236518834.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span>The #1 reason you slack on health and fitness goals in colder months ISN’T EVEN YOUR FAULT!!</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, you have a part to play in all of this, but</span><b><i> there is actually a scientific reason why you have less desire to train and eat healthy when the sunshine of summer fades.</i></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We will explain why a little further down. But ya know what really stinks? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The scientific reason why we all experience these motivation slumps in the winter only adds to an even bigger issue with motivation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span>It doesn’t matter what season it is motivation ALWAYS comes and goes!</p>
<p>Spring, Summer, Fall, or Winter &#8211; you can NEVER rely on it!</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, what can you do when lack of sunshine and warm temps leave you even more tempted to hit snooze and reach for comfort foods? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You certainly don’t throw your hands up in the air and wait until January to make a resolution to crash diet to get your body ready for spring. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Believe it or not, RIGHT NOW is actually the IDEAL time to get started! </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you </span><b><i>START NOW, </i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">you will develop discipline and a routine heading into the holidays. This will put you in a great place mentally and physically to relax and “indulge” a little more at all those holiday gatherings! </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><b><i>Look at it this way ..<br />
</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Would you rather head into the holiday season already making progress toward your goals and be in a great spot <em>(where it would be okay even if you did gain an extra pound or two?)</em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Or would you rather put it off and only add more fat on top of what you want to lose?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The answer is clear— the solution to getting the motivation needed to make it happen, not so much.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But don’t worry! We’ve got ya covered</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (no pun intended)</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with a few easy motivation hacks!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><b>7 TIPS TO STAY MOTIVATED AS SEASONS CHANGE</b></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><b><br />
</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the number one questions we always get is … “<em>I am just not motivated. How can I motivate myself to train and eat better?”</em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As we mentioned earlier, it doesn&#8217;t matter what season it is, </span><b><i>you can’t always rely on motivation. </i></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you have it, great! You should certainly take advantage of it! But you have to know that it is totally normal to not have much of it. Even professional athletes lack motivation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You have to develop other daily habits that create discipline if you want to succeed long term!</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are a few of our pro tips that we use with our clients, specifically when temperatures drop, and motivation seems to be at its lowest! </span></p>
<p><b>TIP #1: Switch To An At Home Training Program</b></p>
<p><img class="size-large wp-image-7448" src="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_185038762.jpeg?resize=1024%2C647&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="647" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_185038762.jpeg?resize=1024%2C647&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_185038762.jpeg?resize=300%2C189&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_185038762.jpeg?resize=768%2C485&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_185038762.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_185038762.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you know that getting out of bed and stepping into the winter elements is going to be an excuse trigger, make a plan to train at home during cooler months! Some of the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">most effective and challenging workouts </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">only require your body weight and </span><b><i>maybe</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a set of dumbbells or some resistance bands.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A good fat-blasting, muscle-building sweat session can 100% be achieved from the comfort of your home!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adjustable dumbbells, ankle weights, resistance bands, a jump rope, etc., are all things that are inexpensive and can easily be stored in a closet or under your bed and pulled out anytime you don’t feel like leaving the house.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But if you have </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">the right training program</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><b><i>you don’t need any of that. </i></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our favorite </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">at-home bodyweight-only program</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is called</span><b> MOVE. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was designed to help you achieve your fitness goals without a single piece of equipment, and each workout is under 20 minutes! </span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Learn more about MOVE by watching the video below!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you need </span><b>a little extra “nudge”</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to get up and get moving, another </span><b>pro-tip we use</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is keeping some </span><a href="https://sculptnation.com/products/pre-workout" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><b>PRE WORKOUT </b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">on your bedside table. Have it already blended up and chug it as soon as your alarm goes off!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By the time you have brushed your teeth and put on your workout clothes, you will have a nice little jolt of energy and</span><b><i> tons of motivation</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to get going before you have a chance to come up with an excuse! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the bottom of this article, we will tell you about a big end of summer sale happening so that you can stock up on our </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">favorite </span><a href="https://sculptnation.com/products/pre-workout" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><b>PRE WORKOUT</b></a><strong> for 40% off when you use code: LABORDAY40 at checkout! </strong></p>
<p><b>TIP #2: Make Your Workouts Seasonal</b></p>
<p><img class="size-large wp-image-7452" src="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_65703942.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_65703942.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_65703942.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_65703942.jpeg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_65703942.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_65703942.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Embrace the change of seasons and take advantage of activities that you can only do in fall or winter! </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Go on a fall hike and view all the gorgeous foliage.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Try rock climbing.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Walk around a corn maze or pumpkin patch with your family. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you live in a snowy climate, go skiing, sledding, build snowmen with your kids, etc.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Go ice skating.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lace-up your sneakers, go for a walk or run at night, and admire all the Christmas lights and decorations.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are some things you can only do and see during specific times of the year. So instead of missing sunshine and water sports, focus on all the positive things that only come about with cooler temps!</span></p>
<p><b>TIP #3: Try Something Totally New</b></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-7454" src="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_361152601.jpeg?resize=1024%2C514&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="514" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_361152601.jpeg?resize=1024%2C514&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_361152601.jpeg?resize=300%2C151&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_361152601.jpeg?resize=768%2C386&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_361152601.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_361152601.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sometimes a change of routine is all you need to boost motivation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you have been doing all your gym lifts alone, recruit a gym buddy! Try switching up your cardio by skipping your solo runs and joining a group fitness class instead. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another option is to </span><b><i>allow yourself to slow down!</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> If you have been crushing it all spring and summer with intense training and hardcore workouts, </span><b><i>it may actually be time to take it down a notch. </i></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Going full force 365 can cause your stress hormone cortisol to increase. This can lead to a host of drawbacks, including weight gain, muscle loss, poor moods, fatigue, and occasional issues sleeping! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We aren’t saying you should become lazy! But if you have been crushing it 24/7 all spring and summer, your body (and mind) may need to slow down.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Use the next few months to embrace a slower routine. </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Commit to daily yoga.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Focus on becoming more flexible.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Switch to low or moderate-intensity cardio, instead of HIIT.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Try out some bodyweight workouts instead of heavy lifting.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Giving your body a couple of months to recover might even make you more responsive when you decide to kick things up again come spring/summer!</span></p>
<p><b>TIP #4: Stay Accountable</b></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-7457" src="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_266584820.jpeg?resize=1024%2C768&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="768" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_266584820.jpeg?resize=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_266584820.jpeg?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_266584820.jpeg?resize=768%2C576&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_266584820.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_266584820.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><b><br />
</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">The best way to stick to a plan is to have someone that you report back to. This could be a friend, family member, a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">social media community</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, or even a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">coach. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Including someone else, or even just telling someone else about your health and fitness goals and asking them to check in with you to make sure you are sticking to the plan, is a great way to keep the promises you make to yourself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you prefer to fly solo, it helps to create visuals. Make a vision board, create a daily checklist you can mark off after each workout, or keep an accomplishment journal.</span></p>
<p><b>TIP #5: Set A Spring Goal</b></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-7458" src="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_47332240.jpeg?resize=1024%2C680&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="680" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_47332240.jpeg?resize=1024%2C680&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_47332240.jpeg?resize=300%2C199&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_47332240.jpeg?resize=768%2C510&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_47332240.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_47332240.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">March may seem like a long time away, but it will be back before you know it, and 6 months is a long time to make significant changes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Setting a goal is a great way to encourage yourself to push past discomforts and temptation, but there is a science to goal setting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The key to creating goals that stick .. </span><b><i>be REALISTIC and SPECIFIC!</i></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s start with </span><b><i>reality. </i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">You should always focus on one goal at a time and make sure you are being honest with yourself if that goal is really attainable.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you know that your schedule will never allow you to work out 6 days a week, why would you choose a program that requires you to do that?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you know it’s not healthy to attempt to lose 10 pounds a week, why would you aim that high?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you love carbs, why would you go on a KETO diet? </span></p>
<p><b><i>Doing these things will essentially set yourself up for failure.</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Set attainable goals that fit YOUR lifestyle. You can always bump things up if your schedule allows, or you notice you aren’t pushing yourself hard enough. Just keep in mind that being realistic isn’t the same as not believing in yourself or making excuses. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moving on to being </span><b><i>specific.</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The more specific you are about your goals, the more likely you will be to reach them. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It may seem like it’s good enough to say things like .. I want to look good, lose weight, or get ripped! </span><b><i>But you have to dig deeper than that!! </i></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wanting to “lose weight,” for example, is an excellent place to start. But ask yourself what that means to you?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you expand on that and say &#8212; “I want to lose 10 pounds of fat. I will do this by not eating any sweets and doing the V Shred </span><a href="https://vshred.com/sp/move/soc-all/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><b>MOVE </b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">program for 30 consecutive days. I am doing this because I want to have better self-esteem and a head start on bikini season.” &#8212; that makes your goal more specific.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The more specific (and attainable) your goals are, the more likely you will be to not give up!</span></p>
<p><b>TIP #6: Reward Yourself</b></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-7459" src="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/vin_sant_32048508_366936073798151_433609263865135104_n.jpg?resize=882%2C1024&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="882" height="1024" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/vin_sant_32048508_366936073798151_433609263865135104_n.jpg?resize=882%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 882w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/vin_sant_32048508_366936073798151_433609263865135104_n.jpg?resize=258%2C300&amp;ssl=1 258w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/vin_sant_32048508_366936073798151_433609263865135104_n.jpg?resize=768%2C892&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/vin_sant_32048508_366936073798151_433609263865135104_n.jpg?w=1080&amp;ssl=1 1080w" sizes="(max-width: 882px) 100vw, 882px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you have checked a “mini goal” off your list, treat yourself. Knowing that you have a reward coming to celebrate your efforts will make you want to achieve it even more. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It may be tempting to make your reward one of your favorite “forbidden foods” but we never suggest that you reward yourself this way.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You aren’t a dog. You should never reward “good behavior” with food. Having this mentality can create a really unhealthy relationship with food.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You need to eat healthy MOST of the time, control your portions, and see food as fuel. But if you are craving something that isn’t quite as healthy as your grilled chicken and rice, never feel like you need to lose 20 pounds to “deserve” a bite of cake, or nice dinner out with your family. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instead of rewarding yourself with food, buy yourself something you have been wanting. Maybe some new workout clothes, a massage, or an extra $20 bucks in your vacation fund! </span></p>

<p><b>TIP #7: Make Mental Health Top Priority</b></p>
<p><img class="size-large wp-image-7460" src="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_255894146.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_255894146.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_255894146.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_255894146.jpeg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_255894146.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_255894146.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Earlier, we mentioned that cold weather motivation dips may not be your fault.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’m sure you have heard of winter blues. Well, it’s a real thing. Less natural light can cause dips in serotonin, the neurotransmitter that regulates mood.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The dark and dreary days of winter can also cause your body to produce more of the sleep hormone melatonin. This shift can disrupt your body and impact your sleep patterns and overall mood.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are a few ways that you can focus on improving your mental health.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Invest in a light therapy box that simulates natural daylight.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Make sure you are supplementing with or eating plenty of foods with Vitamin D.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Start journaling. There is a lot of scientific evidence that supports putting your thoughts on paper provides a long list of benefits, including stress management, self-confidence, and goal setting. </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Suppose you still find yourself struggling with negative seasonal motivation shifts. In that case, you may need to experiment with taking</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> naturally sourced herbs</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to help support brain health and a positive mood.</span></p>
<p><b><i>Here are a few with some great scientific backing to help boost mood.</i></b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>EnXtra: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">A natural caffeine-free patent-pending botanical ingredient that has been shown to help increase dopamine levels.**It is also one of the first and only natural caffeine-free patent-pending botanical ingredients shown to boost mental alertness &amp; acuity for hours or ending in a huge caffeine energy crash.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Piper Nigrum Fruit Extract:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> A very specific type of black pepper that has been shown to help increase both serotonin and dopamine.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>L-Theanine:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> A powerful amino acid that is believed to help reduce occasional anxiety brought on by stressful situations.</span></li>
</ul>

<p><b><i>BOTTOM LINE IF YOU WANT TO STAY MOTIVATED YEAR ROUND</i></b><b><i><br />
</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you put away the shorts and swimsuits and shift out of bikini season, it’s common for motivation to “fall back” with the clocks. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The seasons have to change (unless you live near the equator) &#8211; so you have to figure out ways to</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">not let your fitness goals go into hibernation mode!</span><b><i> </i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pumpkin spice lattes are only here for a limited time, but getting into shape isn’t seasonal! </span><i>It&#8217;s a year-round commitment!!</i><i> </i></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you don&#8217;t have time to hit the gym, but you&#8217;re interested in walking for fitness, start doing the 10,000 steps challenge!</p>
<h2>The 10,000 Steps Challenge | How to Start</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>What is the 10,000 Steps Challenge?</strong></h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-5075 size-full" src="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Two-men-seen-from-behind-walk-exercising-on-a-park-path-steps-challenge-ss.jpg?resize=625%2C400&#038;ssl=1" alt="What is the 10,000 Steps Challenge? | The Steps Challenge | Walking for Fitness" width="625" height="400" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Two-men-seen-from-behind-walk-exercising-on-a-park-path-steps-challenge-ss.jpg?w=625&amp;ssl=1 625w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Two-men-seen-from-behind-walk-exercising-on-a-park-path-steps-challenge-ss.jpg?resize=300%2C192&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>The 10,000 steps challenge is another <a href="https://vshred.com/contest?ref=programs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">30-Day challenge</a>, but this challenges you to walk 10,000 steps per day. This doesn&#8217;t mean you have to start walking 10,000 steps on your first day. That&#8217;s about 5 miles of walking in a day.</p>
<p>30-Day challenges are organized to progressively increase your reps so that your physical ability is continuously improving. You should start with a number that suits your current lifestyle:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>4,000 steps per day </strong>if you&#8217;re someone who spends a lot of time sitting down throughout the day.</li>
<li><strong>6,000</strong> <strong>steps per day </strong>if you spend about 5-6 hours a day sitting down.</li>
<li><strong>8,000 steps per day</strong> if you have an active lifestyle.</li>
<li><strong>10,000 steps per day </strong>if you have a very active lifestyle.</li>
</ul>
<p>The steps challenge is mostly catered to people who are looking to <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/30-day-workout-challenge/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">improve their lifestyle</a> with the simple act of walking. Most participants start with 4,000 steps per day. Recording their progress helps them realize how much time they actually spend sitting down versus walking and being active.</p>
<p>Start small with 4,000 steps a day for 2-3 days. Then on the fourth day, increase the number to 5,000. You can stay on this 5,000-mark for another day or increase your steps by the one thousand after each day. Here&#8217;s how your first week of the steps challenge may look:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Day 1: </strong>4,000 steps</li>
<li><strong>Day 2: </strong>4,000 steps</li>
<li><strong>Day 3: </strong>5,000 steps</li>
<li><strong>Day 4: </strong>6,000 steps</li>
<li><strong>Day 5: </strong>6,000 steps</li>
<li><strong>Day 6: </strong>7,000 steps</li>
<li><strong>Day 7: </strong>8,000 steps</li>
</ul>
<p>If the 1000 increments are too high to keep up, you can always lower it down to 500. Then continue to increase your steps until you reach the 10,000-mark and your feet will start feeling like it&#8217;s nothing. You can even go past the 10,000-mark if your body is strong enough to do so.</p>
<h3><strong>Why 10,000 Steps?</strong></h3>
<p>The number 10,000 came from a Japanese marketing strategy called &#8220;Manpo-Kei&#8221; which means &#8220;10,000 steps meter&#8221;. It was aimed at increasing the citizens&#8217; average 4,000 daily steps to 10,000 to help them burn off <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/how-many-calories-should-i-eat-lose-weight/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">500 calories</a> and stay healthy.</p>
<p>On the other hand, 10,000 steps per day are equivalent to 5 miles and 30 minutes of daily exercise. Turning the steps challenge into a habit can help you maintain the CDC&#8217;s recommended amount of 150 minutes of exercise per week.</p>
<p>People from all over the world are starting to follow the steps challenge. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18048441" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Some scientists</a> have published their works to show that there are evident health improvements in people who do the 10,000 steps challenge. Some of these benefits include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Healthy weight loss, </strong>which is all about losing half a pound per week and the extra steps you take in this challenge can help you burn about 2,000 calories per week.</li>
<li><strong>Decrease cardiovascular health</strong> <strong>risks </strong>such as stroke because constant walking keeps your heart pumping and improves blood circulation.</li>
<li><strong>Stronger and healthier bones</strong> from this weight-bearing activity.</li>
<li><strong>Improved mood</strong> due to the extra dopamine releases of the body and vitamin D from the sun if you&#8217;re outside.</li>
<li><strong>Better sleep</strong> because your body is tired, relaxed, and your muscles have loosened any stiffness that would&#8217;ve accumulated from sitting down for too long.</li>
<li><strong>Higher energy levels</strong> from better sleep and the fact that keeping your body active can shake the feeling of sluggishness that hits you in the middle of the day.</li>
<li><strong>Lessens back pain</strong> that&#8217;s caused by excessive sitting.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Who can do the Steps Challenge?</strong></h3>
<p>Anyone can do the steps challenge. It&#8217;s mostly geared towards people who live a more sedentary life but it can definitely benefit anyone with an active lifestyle.</p>
<p>The steps challenge is especially great for people with arthritis. Walking is a weight-bearing exercise that&#8217;s very low in intensity, but an increase in daily steps can help strengthen the joints and prevent pain.</p>
<h3><strong>When is the Best Time to do the Steps Challenge?</strong></h3>
<p>You can start the steps challenge whenever you want. It&#8217;s all about monitoring your daily steps and trying to squeeze in as many steps as you can throughout the day. Remember that you have 24 hours to complete your set goal.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>In the morning</strong>, wake yourself up by starting your steps challenge in the morning. Take a short morning walk every weekday around your house or your block. Then take a longer route during the weekends.</li>
<li><strong>During your lunch</strong> <strong>break</strong>, if you&#8217;ve finished your lunch and still have some time left, try to take a walk around the office or your building.</li>
<li><strong>In the afternoon</strong>, if your destination is close enough to walk, try to avoid driving or commuting to continue to add more steps for the day.</li>
<li><strong>After dinner</strong>, walking after a meal can help regulate your digestion and prepare your body for a good night&#8217;s sleep.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Where can You Log in Your Steps?</strong></h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-5076 size-full" src="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Young-female-jogger-enjoying-rest-after-workout-while-checking-results-of-training-steps-challenge-ss.jpg?resize=625%2C400&#038;ssl=1" alt="Where can You Log in Your Steps? | The Steps Challenge | Walking for Fitness" width="625" height="400" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Young-female-jogger-enjoying-rest-after-workout-while-checking-results-of-training-steps-challenge-ss.jpg?w=625&amp;ssl=1 625w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Young-female-jogger-enjoying-rest-after-workout-while-checking-results-of-training-steps-challenge-ss.jpg?resize=300%2C192&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>It&#8217;s almost impossible to manually count your daily steps once you reach the thousands. There are a lot of fitness trackers available online that don&#8217;t require you buy any external gear. The best way to log in your steps is by using a steps challenge app on your smartphone that automatically registers each step you take throughout the day.</p>
<h3><strong>How to Finish the Steps Challenge?</strong></h3>
<p>Sometimes you&#8217;re going to feel too tired to finish your daily steps. Here are some step challenge ideas on how to help you finish the steps challenge:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Listen to music</strong> with a bouncy tune or strong beat to help motivate you on your walk.</li>
<li><strong>Invite family and</strong> friends to join you which can help pass minutes and hours of walking in a single conversation.</li>
<li><strong>Walk your dog </strong>if your friends and family are unavailable. You&#8217;ll also be doing your dog a favor as you do your steps challenge.</li>
<li><strong>Take the stairs</strong> if your next stop is only a few floors away. It&#8217;s a lot easier to take the stairs when you&#8217;re headed down but going up the stairs also adds a little extra calorie-burn.</li>
<li><strong>Walk while multitasking.</strong> Whenever you find yourself doing tasks that only require your hands like brushing your teeth, talking on the phone, or during commercial breaks, walk down the hallway to squeeze in some steps.</li>
<li><strong>Dedicate time to the steps challenge. </strong>Leave out 30 minutes to an hour a day or every other day for just walking.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Watch the video below and learn a simple trick that will keep you motivated to get in shape:</strong></p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='1170' height='659' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/afKWf8zNcoc?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></p>
<p>It&#8217;s important to pay attention to your body and find out if your daily goal is too easy or too much for your feet. Finding the right increments in steps is highly dependent on your own health and ability. At the end of the day, the steps challenge is all about turning walking into a natural habit in order to improve your health and fitness.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Running for weight loss is a great approach for burning calories and shedding those extra pounds. It strengthens your legs and improves your cardiovascular health. Know the necessary preparations for a safe and successful weight loss program to reap the benefits of this great cardio exercise.</p>
<h2>Running for Weight Loss | Tips for a Safe and Effective Cardio Workout</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span style="color: #000080;">1. Seek a Doctor&#8217;s Advice First</span></h3>
<p>It&#8217;s always wise to consult a doctor first before starting any type of exercise program that may be more strenuous than what you are used to.</p>
<p>This is to ensure it&#8217;s safe for you to continue, and you&#8217;re physically capable of your planned regimen. Precautions may be necessary if a person has a history of underlying health issues.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #000080;">2. Invest in a Good Pair of Running Shoes</span></h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-1104 size-full" src="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/man-tying-jogging-shoesa-person-running-running-for-weight-loss-ss.jpg?resize=625%2C417&#038;ssl=1" alt="Invest in a Good Pair of Running Shoes | Running for Weight Loss | Cardio Workouts | weight loss running program" width="625" height="417" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/man-tying-jogging-shoesa-person-running-running-for-weight-loss-ss.jpg?w=625&amp;ssl=1 625w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/man-tying-jogging-shoesa-person-running-running-for-weight-loss-ss.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px" data-recalc-dims="1" /><br />
There are shoes specifically designed for running. Your footwear should be durable, has good cushion, and holds your feet firmly as you run.</p>
<p>Foot injuries are very common in running, so you&#8217;ll want to make sure those feet are well-protected.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #000080;">3. Dynamic Stretching Before You Run</span></h3>
<p>Your leg muscles must be flexible before engaging in any running activity. The lesser you rest, the faster you burn those calories so it&#8217;s important to condition those muscles beforehand.</p>
<p>Before your run, you&#8217;ll want to be sure you&#8217;re actively doing dynamic stretching versus static stretching. You&#8217;ll only want to do static stretching post-run.</p>
<p>Muscles are more susceptible to injuries when they&#8217;re used without proper stretching.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #000080;">4. Set Your Weight Loss Goals</span></h3>
<p>Knowing how much weight you plan to lose allows you to carefully plan the exercise program.</p>
<p>This enables you to calculate an allowable time and distance for your runs. It will serve as a marker, so you&#8217;ll know when to ease up a bit and make way for other workout routines.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #000080;">5. Start Slow</span></h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-1105 size-full" src="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/strong-man-gym-bodybuilder-running-on-running-for-weight-loss-ss.jpg?resize=625%2C352&#038;ssl=1" alt="Start Slow | Running for Weight Loss | Cardio Workouts | weight loss running program" width="625" height="352" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/strong-man-gym-bodybuilder-running-on-running-for-weight-loss-ss.jpg?w=625&amp;ssl=1 625w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/strong-man-gym-bodybuilder-running-on-running-for-weight-loss-ss.jpg?resize=300%2C169&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px" data-recalc-dims="1" /><br />
It&#8217;s not advisable to run the entire time in the first few days. Alternate running and walking in the starting stages of your program.</p>
<p>This helps condition your breathing and muscle use as you gradually progress. Even our body needs a bit of getting used to before it settles for more strenuous use.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Don&#8217;t have time for a run right now? Try out a shorter, effective <a style="color: #ff0000;" href="https://vshred.com/blog/hiit-cardio-workout/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="color: #0000ff;">HIIT cardio workout</span>.</a> Don&#8217;t know which is best for you?

<h3><span style="color: #000080;">6. Gradually Increase Your Running Time</span></h3>
<p>Your weight loss progress may not be very desirable if you keep the same running time for too long. Aim to increase your run time at least every week.</p>
<p>A 5-10 minutes increase each week is ideal enough to burn more calories. You&#8217;ll eventually start to be comfortable in your running exercise and run longer distances in the weeks to come.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #000080;">7. Hydrate Regularly</span></h3>

Aside from cleansing your body from toxins and waste, <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/water-for-weight-loss/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hydrating also speeds up your metabolism</a> for faster fat burning.</p>
<p>Drinking water also increases your energy level, so you&#8217;ll be ready for more challenging goals. Obviously, the running workouts will become more effective.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #000080;">8. Have a Healthy Balanced Diet</span></h3>
<p>A well-balanced diet helps you get the necessary nutrients your body needs to get through your weight loss running program.</p>
<p>Food plays a very important role in fueling your exercise and making stronger bones and muscles. Carbohydrates, proteins, vitamins, and minerals all have their specific functions to keep those legs going to help reach your goal of losing weight.</p>
