								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><b>Ladies love these body parts, let’s focus on firming them up!</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We ran across some pretty intriguing research! Apparently, there are VERY SPECIFIC body parts that the ladies rate as THE SEXIEST muscles on a man!</span></p>
<p><b>Can you guess what they are?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’ll tell you in just a second and we will show you a workout that will focus on making these body parts stand out! </span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-7665" src="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Thumbnail-7.png?resize=1024%2C576&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Thumbnail-7.png?resize=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Thumbnail-7.png?resize=300%2C169&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Thumbnail-7.png?resize=768%2C432&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Thumbnail-7.png?w=1280&amp;ssl=1 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><b><i>BUT FIRST…</i></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We wanna quickly mention that you should be working out FOR YOU. In order to see long-lasting results, you have to want to get in shape for yourself. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s just let the ladies be that ADDED motivation to lose those extra pounds and hit the gym hard.</span></p>
<p><b><i>After all…</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are single, you obviously want to stand out. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are taken, you want your significant other to like what they see.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is also the added benefit of the self-confidence that comes with feeling better about yourself. Ask any female and they will tell you self-confidence is sexy! </span></p>
<p><b><i>Alright, back to that research&#8230;.</i></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is probably no surprise that UPPER BODY dominates the list of muscles women find the most attractive.</span></p>

That is a scary number!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Good thing you found this article because </span><b><i>we aren’t going to let YOU be “most” people! </i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lower temps do not have to equal larger waistlines! You just have to have a plan! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this short read we will &#8230;</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Explain why winter weight gain happens. Knowing why is important if you want to prevent it and the reason is probably not what you think. In fact, it is partially not even your fault!</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tell you why fall/winter is actually the BEST time to start a diet and training plan.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Give you 7 easy pro tips that will help guide you through the next few months. </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You may believe winter weight gain happens because of the holidays. Those extra home cooked meals and holiday parties are certainly a factor. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But </span><b><i>there is a DAILY issue you need to be prepared to fight </i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">if you want to avoid packing on winter pounds.</span></p>
<p><b>WHY YOU REALLY PACK ON POUNDS AFTER LABOR DAY</b></p>
<p><img class="size-large wp-image-7471" src="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_130930953.jpeg?resize=1024%2C512&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="512" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_130930953.jpeg?resize=1024%2C512&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_130930953.jpeg?resize=300%2C150&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_130930953.jpeg?resize=768%2C384&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_130930953.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_130930953.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the spring and summer months, you are given what we call a</span><b> fitness freebie. </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You get a </span><b><i>seasonal motivation boost</i></b> <span style="font-weight: 400;">that doesn’t happen when temperatures start to drop, and you begin to pull out the chunky sweaters and comfy leggings. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not only is the sun shining (which makes you happier because of Vitamin D), you are wearing LESS clothing in the summer months. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I don’t know about you, but knowing I’m going to be exposing more skin makes walking in the gym a little easier. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Covering up in layers, no doubt leads to the temptation to slack on body goals! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Knowing your arms, legs, and abs will be less exposed can easily be an excuse to slack. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, being layered up often means you don’t SEE the extra pounds, so they are easier to ignore.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But there is more to it than being bundled up….</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-7477" src="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_236518834.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_236518834.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_236518834.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_236518834.jpeg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_236518834.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_236518834.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span>The #1 reason you slack on health and fitness goals in colder months ISN’T EVEN YOUR FAULT!!</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, you have a part to play in all of this, but</span><b><i> there is actually a scientific reason why you have less desire to train and eat healthy when the sunshine of summer fades.</i></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We will explain why a little further down. But ya know what really stinks? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The scientific reason why we all experience these motivation slumps in the winter only adds to an even bigger issue with motivation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span>It doesn’t matter what season it is motivation ALWAYS comes and goes!</p>
<p>Spring, Summer, Fall, or Winter &#8211; you can NEVER rely on it!</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, what can you do when lack of sunshine and warm temps leave you even more tempted to hit snooze and reach for comfort foods? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You certainly don’t throw your hands up in the air and wait until January to make a resolution to crash diet to get your body ready for spring. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Believe it or not, RIGHT NOW is actually the IDEAL time to get started! </span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">To help you out, and give you an extra edge on beating winter weight gain, we are offering a special end of summer 40% OFF promotion on ALL </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sculpt Nation Supplements!   </span></p>

</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><b><i>Look at it this way ..<br />
</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Would you rather head into the holiday season already making progress toward your goals and be in a great spot <em>(where it would be okay even if you did gain an extra pound or two?)</em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Or would you rather put it off and only add more fat on top of what you want to lose?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The answer is clear— the solution to getting the motivation needed to make it happen, not so much.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But don’t worry! We’ve got ya covered</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (no pun intended)</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with a few easy motivation hacks!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><b>7 TIPS TO STAY MOTIVATED AS SEASONS CHANGE</b></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><b><br />
</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the number one questions we always get is … “<em>I am just not motivated. How can I motivate myself to train and eat better?”</em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As we mentioned earlier, it doesn&#8217;t matter what season it is, </span><b><i>you can’t always rely on motivation. </i></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you have it, great! You should certainly take advantage of it! But you have to know that it is totally normal to not have much of it. Even professional athletes lack motivation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You have to develop other daily habits that create discipline if you want to succeed long term!</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are a few of our pro tips that we use with our clients, specifically when temperatures drop, and motivation seems to be at its lowest! </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you know that getting out of bed and stepping into the winter elements is going to be an excuse trigger, make a plan to train at home during cooler months! Some of the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">most effective and challenging workouts </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">only require your body weight and </span><b><i>maybe</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a set of dumbbells or some resistance bands.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A good fat-blasting, muscle-building sweat session can 100% be achieved from the comfort of your home!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adjustable dumbbells, ankle weights, resistance bands, a jump rope, etc., are all things that are inexpensive and can easily be stored in a closet or under your bed and pulled out anytime you don’t feel like leaving the house.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But if you have </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">the right training program</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><b><i>you don’t need any of that. </i></b></p>

<p><img class="size-large wp-image-7452" src="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_65703942.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_65703942.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_65703942.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_65703942.jpeg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_65703942.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_65703942.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Embrace the change of seasons and take advantage of activities that you can only do in fall or winter! </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Go on a fall hike and view all the gorgeous foliage.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Try rock climbing.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Walk around a corn maze or pumpkin patch with your family. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you live in a snowy climate, go skiing, sledding, build snowmen with your kids, etc.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Go ice skating.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lace-up your sneakers, go for a walk or run at night, and admire all the Christmas lights and decorations.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are some things you can only do and see during specific times of the year. So instead of missing sunshine and water sports, focus on all the positive things that only come about with cooler temps!</span></p>
<p><b>TIP #3: Try Something Totally New</b></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-7454" src="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_361152601.jpeg?resize=1024%2C514&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="514" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_361152601.jpeg?resize=1024%2C514&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_361152601.jpeg?resize=300%2C151&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_361152601.jpeg?resize=768%2C386&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_361152601.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_361152601.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sometimes a change of routine is all you need to boost motivation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you have been doing all your gym lifts alone, recruit a gym buddy! Try switching up your cardio by skipping your solo runs and joining a group fitness class instead. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another option is to </span><b><i>allow yourself to slow down!</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> If you have been crushing it all spring and summer with intense training and hardcore workouts, </span><b><i>it may actually be time to take it down a notch. </i></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Going full force 365 can cause your stress hormone cortisol to increase. This can lead to a host of drawbacks, including weight gain, muscle loss, poor moods, fatigue, and occasional issues sleeping! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We aren’t saying you should become lazy! But if you have been crushing it 24/7 all spring and summer, your body (and mind) may need to slow down.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Use the next few months to embrace a slower routine. </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Commit to daily yoga.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Focus on becoming more flexible.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Switch to low or moderate-intensity cardio, instead of HIIT.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Try out some bodyweight workouts instead of heavy lifting.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Giving your body a couple of months to recover might even make you more responsive when you decide to kick things up again come spring/summer!</span></p>
<p><b>TIP #4: Stay Accountable</b></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-7457" src="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_266584820.jpeg?resize=1024%2C768&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="768" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_266584820.jpeg?resize=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_266584820.jpeg?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_266584820.jpeg?resize=768%2C576&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_266584820.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_266584820.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><b><br />
</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">The best way to stick to a plan is to have someone that you report back to. This could be a friend, family member, a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">social media community</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, or even a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">coach. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Including someone else, or even just telling someone else about your health and fitness goals and asking them to check in with you to make sure you are sticking to the plan, is a great way to keep the promises you make to yourself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you prefer to fly solo, it helps to create visuals. Make a vision board, create a daily checklist you can mark off after each workout, or keep an accomplishment journal.</span></p>
<p><b>TIP #5: Set A Spring Goal</b></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-7458" src="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_47332240.jpeg?resize=1024%2C680&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="680" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_47332240.jpeg?resize=1024%2C680&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_47332240.jpeg?resize=300%2C199&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_47332240.jpeg?resize=768%2C510&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_47332240.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_47332240.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">March may seem like a long time away, but it will be back before you know it, and 6 months is a long time to make significant changes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Setting a goal is a great way to encourage yourself to push past discomforts and temptation, but there is a science to goal setting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The key to creating goals that stick .. </span><b><i>be REALISTIC and SPECIFIC!</i></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s start with </span><b><i>reality. </i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">You should always focus on one goal at a time and make sure you are being honest with yourself if that goal is really attainable.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you know that your schedule will never allow you to work out 6 days a week, why would you choose a program that requires you to do that?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you know it’s not healthy to attempt to lose 10 pounds a week, why would you aim that high?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you love carbs, why would you go on a KETO diet? </span></p>
<p><b><i>Doing these things will essentially set yourself up for failure.</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Set attainable goals that fit YOUR lifestyle. You can always bump things up if your schedule allows, or you notice you aren’t pushing yourself hard enough. Just keep in mind that being realistic isn’t the same as not believing in yourself or making excuses. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moving on to being </span><b><i>specific.</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The more specific you are about your goals, the more likely you will be to reach them. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It may seem like it’s good enough to say things like .. I want to look good, lose weight, or get ripped! </span><b><i>But you have to dig deeper than that!! </i></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wanting to “lose weight,” for example, is an excellent place to start. But ask yourself what that means to you?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you expand on that and say &#8212; “I want to lose 10 pounds of fat. I will do this by not eating any sweets and doing the V Shred </span><a href="https://vshred.com/sp/move/soc-all/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><b>MOVE </b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">program for 30 consecutive days. I am doing this because I want to have better self-esteem and a head start on bikini season.” &#8212; that makes your goal more specific.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The more specific (and attainable) your goals are, the more likely you will be to not give up!</span></p>
<p><b>TIP #6: Reward Yourself</b></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-7459" src="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/vin_sant_32048508_366936073798151_433609263865135104_n.jpg?resize=882%2C1024&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="882" height="1024" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/vin_sant_32048508_366936073798151_433609263865135104_n.jpg?resize=882%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 882w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/vin_sant_32048508_366936073798151_433609263865135104_n.jpg?resize=258%2C300&amp;ssl=1 258w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/vin_sant_32048508_366936073798151_433609263865135104_n.jpg?resize=768%2C892&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/vin_sant_32048508_366936073798151_433609263865135104_n.jpg?w=1080&amp;ssl=1 1080w" sizes="(max-width: 882px) 100vw, 882px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you have checked a “mini goal” off your list, treat yourself. Knowing that you have a reward coming to celebrate your efforts will make you want to achieve it even more. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It may be tempting to make your reward one of your favorite “forbidden foods” but we never suggest that you reward yourself this way.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You aren’t a dog. You should never reward “good behavior” with food. Having this mentality can create a really unhealthy relationship with food.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You need to eat healthy MOST of the time, control your portions, and see food as fuel. But if you are craving something that isn’t quite as healthy as your grilled chicken and rice, never feel like you need to lose 20 pounds to “deserve” a bite of cake, or nice dinner out with your family. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instead of rewarding yourself with food, buy yourself something you have been wanting. Maybe some new workout clothes, a massage, or an extra $20 bucks in your vacation fund! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you think you need some nutrition guidance or want to learn more about creating a healthy relationship with food, take our <a href="https://vshred.com/sp/survey/survey-aka1/">free body type quiz</a> and we&#8217;ll tell you exactly what type of diet will deliver results for your goals and specific body type. </span></p>
<p><b>TIP #7: Make Mental Health Top Priority</b></p>
<p><img class="size-large wp-image-7460" src="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_255894146.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_255894146.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_255894146.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_255894146.jpeg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_255894146.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_255894146.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Earlier, we mentioned that cold weather motivation dips may not be your fault.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’m sure you have heard of winter blues. Well, it’s a real thing. Less natural light can cause dips in serotonin, the neurotransmitter that regulates mood.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The dark and dreary days of winter can also cause your body to produce more of the sleep hormone melatonin. This shift can disrupt your body and impact your sleep patterns and overall mood.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are a few ways that you can focus on improving your mental health.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Invest in a light therapy box that simulates natural daylight.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Make sure you are supplementing with or eating plenty of foods with Vitamin D.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Start journaling. There is a lot of scientific evidence that supports putting your thoughts on paper provides a long list of benefits, including stress management, self-confidence, and goal setting. </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Suppose you still find yourself struggling with negative seasonal motivation shifts. In that case, you may need to experiment with taking</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> naturally sourced herbs</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to help support brain health and a positive mood.</span></p>
<p><b><i>Here are a few with some great scientific backing to help boost mood.</i></b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>EnXtra: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">A natural caffeine-free patent-pending botanical ingredient that has been shown to help increase dopamine levels.**It is also one of the first and only natural caffeine-free patent-pending botanical ingredients shown to boost mental alertness &amp; acuity for hours or ending in a huge caffeine energy crash.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Piper Nigrum Fruit Extract:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> A very specific type of black pepper that has been shown to help increase both serotonin and dopamine.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>L-Theanine:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> A powerful amino acid that is believed to help reduce occasional anxiety brought on by stressful situations.</span></li>

<p><b><i>BOTTOM LINE IF YOU WANT TO STAY MOTIVATED YEAR ROUND</i></b><b><i><br />

<p>Motherhood is a mix of many things….<br />
It is a blessing, but it can also be frustrating, hectic, and at times, even monotonous.<br />
It is beautiful knowing that you are helping shape a future generation, but that also brings about a lot of pressure and responsibility.</p>
<p>You are always going mentally and physically, which means just like any other job, burnout is bound to happen<em><strong> if you don’t s-l-o-w down!!</strong></em></p>
<p>If you are a mom reading this… we want you to ask yourself a few important questions.</p>
<ul>
<li>When is the last time I put my needs first?</li>
<li>Do I regularly focus on self-care?</li>
<li>Do I have a good mom/life balance?</li>
</ul>
<p>You likely answered…</p>
<ul>
<li>Rarely/Never</li>
<li>No, not regularly.</li>
<li>What is life .. outside of being a mom?</li>
</ul>
<p>Being a mom has required responsibilities, but you have to stop and think about <em><strong>your own needs</strong></em>. Going non-stop can take a toll on both your mental and physical health.</p>
<p>How can you be SUPERMOM if you aren’t taking time to REST and RECHARGE?</p>
<p><strong>Easier said than done, right?</strong><br />
It SOUNDS great to be able to pour a glass of wine, put on a face mask, jump in a bubble bath, and turn on a meditation app.</p>
<p>In REALITY, you haven’t had time to go to the store to get groceries, your kid’s toys are still in the tub that you haven’t had time to clean, and if you do manage to hop in, forget silence. It won’t be long before there is a little knock at the door, interrupting your zen!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>BUT MOMS… LISTEN UP!</strong></p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-7087" src="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_221068765.jpeg?resize=1170%2C780&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1170" height="780" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_221068765.jpeg?w=6500&amp;ssl=1 6500w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_221068765.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_221068765.jpeg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_221068765.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_221068765.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_221068765.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1170px) 100vw, 1170px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>To be able to take care of everyone else, you have to feel your best both physically and mentally.</p>
<p>Self-care is not selfish .. it’s actually the opposite.<em><strong> A happy and fulfilled mom .. is no doubt a better mom!</strong></em></p>
<p>Use Mother’s Day as a reminder that YOU ARE SPECIAL and deserve just as much TLC as everyone else in your family!</p>
<p>Here are FIVE IDEAS that will help give you the mental and physical energy needed to tackle both the chaos and glory that make up motherhood!!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>5 Ways To Focus On Self-Care This Mother’s Day</strong></p>
<p>Self-Care is a personal process. What helps you unwind may be different than what helps somebody else de-stress. However, these 5 self-care tips are things ALL busy moms should consider.</p>
<p>Remember, self-care isn’t just a day at the spa or date night without the kids.<br />
It is ANY activity you do that will improve your mental, spiritual, and physical health.</p>
<p>In fact, the best types of self-care aren’t about only feeling good in the moment. Just like your health and fitness journey… the ultimate goal of self-care should be its long-term effects!</p>
<p><strong>1: DISCONNECT</strong></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-7088" src="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_338261185.jpeg?resize=1170%2C780&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1170" height="780" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_338261185.jpeg?w=7776&amp;ssl=1 7776w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_338261185.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_338261185.jpeg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_338261185.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_338261185.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_338261185.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1170px) 100vw, 1170px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>Put your computer away, turn off your phone, don’t tune into the news, and click out of Netflix.</p>
<p>Sometimes the most effective thing you can do for yourself has little to do with what TO DO and more to do with what you DO NOT DO!</p>
<p>While it is great to be informed and socially connected .. <em><strong>too much time plugged in can add to your stress, anxiety, and life fears.</strong></em></p>
<p>This is especially true for social media. It is one thing if you <em><strong>only</strong></em> follow accounts that motivate you and feed you with positivity. But many of us “follow” the lives of others and end up comparing, leading to feelings of not being good enough.</p>
<p>Social media can also be a rabbit hole of negativity and biased opinions, leaving you confused, negative, anxious, uptight, and even angry. <em><strong>Put yourself on a social media diet and limit your screen-time and scrolling.</strong></em></p>
<p>The same “digital detox” rules should also apply for TV time. The news (especially these days) can only fuel your fears.<em><strong> If you must watch, tune in only to be informed and immediately power off!</strong></em></p>
<p>If binge-watching Netflix is how you like to unwind, go for it! But the next time you have watched enough episodes for it to ask you &#8211; “are you still watching” &#8211; consider doing something else relaxing that could be more beneficial to your long term mental health.</p>
<p>Take up a new hobby you would enjoy, journal, call a friend, read a book, maybe even try those “stress relieving” adult coloring books!</p>
<p><strong>2: GET REGULAR SLEEP</strong></p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-7089" src="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_233195435.jpeg?resize=1170%2C781&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1170" height="781" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_233195435.jpeg?w=7360&amp;ssl=1 7360w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_233195435.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_233195435.jpeg?resize=768%2C513&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_233195435.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_233195435.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_233195435.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1170px) 100vw, 1170px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>In an attempt to do as much as possible with the 24 hours given, most moms sacrifice sleep and end up sleep-deprived.</p>
<p>While it may seem like the only way to get everything done, exhaustion only slows you down, making you less productive while you are awake.</p>
<p>Getting quality shut-eye is crucial to maintaining your physical and mental health. 7-9 hours of sleep is non-negotiable if you want to be able to have the clarity and energy needed to tackle your mile-long list of supermom tasks.</p>
<p>Even more than slowing down to get in bed, sometimes the ability to actually fall asleep is the biggest challenge busy moms face.</p>
<p>It is common to replay all the events of your stress-filled day or go over your endless mom to-do-list in your head.</p>
<p>Here are a few tips to help you get that critical shut-eye!</p>
<ul>
<li>Go back to self-care tip #1 and UNPLUG at least one-hour before bedtime.</li>
<li>Do 5-10 minutes of stretching or yoga.</li>
<li>Take a warm bath just before laying down.</li>
<li>Eat a <a href="https://sculptnation.com/products/protein" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">protein</a>-rich meal that isn’t too heavy.</li>
<li>Write in your journal, specifically a gratitude journal.</li>
<li>Try to be in bed around the same time every night.</li>
<li>Try some breathing techniques.</li>
<li>Use a weighted blanket.</li>
<li>Use Essential Oils &amp; Aromatherapy Machines</li>
<li>Incorporate natural <a href="https://sculptnation.com/products/burn-pm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">sleep-enhancing supplements</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Our favorite supplement for sleep is a product called <a href="https://sculptnation.com/products/burn-pm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BURN PM</a>.</p>

<p>You wouldn&#8217;t let your kids skip their yearly dental cleaning or wellness check, and you are probably constantly on to your significant other to see their primary care provider for an annual check-up. But are you too busy worrying about everyone else&#8217;s preventative health .. that you are forgetting about your own?</p>
<p>Take some time to look at your calendar and see when you can schedule YOUR regular doctor appointments for things like yearly blood work, exams, scans, cleanings, etc.</p>
<p>You should always try to be ahead of any potential health issues. Getting sick could leave you down and out for days or weeks … <em><strong>and we all know moms don’t get sick days!</strong></em></p>
<p>Book those yearly check-ups, then head to your kitchen and take inventory of <em><strong>other ways you could improve your overall health through supplementation and diet.</strong></em></p>
<p>Stock your pantry and fridge with healthy choices that are easy to grab and go. We always keep a container of <a href="https://sculptnation.com/products/protein" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sculpt Nation Protein</a> on hand for shakes, smoothies, and even simple things like <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/pumpkin-spice-protein/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">protein pancakes</a>. This will ensure you are less tempted to reach for your kid’s snacks when you are too busy to cook.</p>
<p>Two of our favorite supplements that assist in optimizing overall health are <a href="https://sculptnation.com/products/greens" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GREENS</a> and <a href="https://sculptnation.com/products/turmeric" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TURMERIC</a>.</p>
<p>It is hard to get in the nutrients your body needs through diet alone. Adding quality <a href="https://sculptnation.com/products/greens" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GREENS</a> helps close that gap.</p>
<p><a href="https://sculptnation.com/products/greens" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sculpt Nation GREENS</a> is a delicious superfood that is packed with herbs, botanicals, antioxidants, and agents that support a healthy inflammatory response. Just one dose gives you an added boost of powerful superfoods.</p>
<p>In addition to assisting in revitalizing your mental and physical energy, our <a href="https://sculptnation.com/products/greens" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GREENS</a> help prime and support your body and brain to be able to better burn fat, build muscle, and increase performance.</p>
<p>Another supplement you may want to consider to stay healthy is <a href="https://sculptnation.com/products/turmeric" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TURMERIC</a>.</p>
<p>This super-nutrient has been used for centuries to optimize health. But in recent years, studies have found that turmeric goes beyond helping with things like temporary pain related to exercise or supporting a healthy inflammatory response. They discovered it can potentially assist in fighting fatigue, burning body fat, enhancing mental clarity, and help ease gastrointestinal issues such as occasional bloating.</p>
<p>Sculpt Nation&#8217;s <a href="https://sculptnation.com/products/turmeric" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TURMERIC</a> not only provides you with the exact dose you need to see and feel benefits, our proprietary blend includes other key nutrients required for this powerful herb to be absorbed.</p>

<p>For some moms, a workout is the perfect escape. For others, working out may seem more like a chore than a treat.</p>

<p>Getting in some sort of daily physical activity can enhance mood, reduce stress, and give you a major self-esteem boost!</p>

<p>It may not be IDEAL .. or the escape you want .. but at least you will be able to get it done! <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/strong-as-a-mother-mommy-me-workouts-for-every-age/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Check out this article for OVER 30 kid-friendly exercise ideas!</a></p>

<p><strong>5: Do Nothing (Zero. Zilch. Nada.)</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-7121" src="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_307475146-1.jpeg?resize=1170%2C780&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1170" height="780" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_307475146-1.jpeg?w=5760&amp;ssl=1 5760w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_307475146-1.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_307475146-1.jpeg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_307475146-1.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_307475146-1.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_307475146-1.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1170px) 100vw, 1170px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Go to your room, sit outside, or even get in your car! Go anywhere you can find some peace and quiet and don’t do ANYTHING … other than closing your eyes and listening to your heart.</p>
<p>This is different from meditating, where you attempt to clear your mind of ANY thoughts.</p>
<p>With this type of mental mindfulness, you are simply slowing down long enough to listen to the desires hidden deep within you.</p>
<p>The purpose of this self-care exercise is not to leave you sad or anxious. The goal is to reconnect with yourself so that you can be more aware of any area of your life that may be lacking.</p>
<p>This is a great way to explore yourself to determine any areas of your life that are fulfilling and possibly lacking.</p>
<p>Think about things you love, ways you have been ignoring your needs and desires, and what you want out of your life … aside from being a good mom.</p>
<p>“Mom life” can get so busy that it’s common to forget who you are and what makes you happy.<br />
Take a moment to self-reflect!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>TAKE SOME TIME TO SELF CARE</strong><br />
<strong>AND</strong><br />
<strong>DO NOT FEEL GUILTY ABOUT IT!</strong></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-7093" src="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_332558922.jpeg?resize=1170%2C641&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1170" height="641" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_332558922.jpeg?w=5760&amp;ssl=1 5760w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_332558922.jpeg?resize=300%2C164&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_332558922.jpeg?resize=768%2C421&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_332558922.jpeg?resize=1024%2C561&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_332558922.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_332558922.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1170px) 100vw, 1170px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>Far too often, moms are flooded with feelings of guilt when they actually do take time to break-free from mom life and take care of themselves.</p>
<p>Whether you decide to wake up 10 minutes early to sit and enjoy your cup of coffee alone before your crazy day begins, or take two hours to train and go to the spa, <em><strong>never feel guilty about time spent ON YOU!</strong></em></p>
<p>Self-care is an essential part of motherhood! The more time you can set aside to take care of your own needs, the happier you will be. Which will only bring more happiness, energy, and love to those around you!</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>How healthy are you … really?</strong></em></p>
<p>You may be an ideal weight.</p>
<p>Your last check-up may have resulted in a clean bill of health.</p>
<p>You take daily vitamins, move your body, and get decent sleep ..<em><strong> but are you SURE you are giving your body what it needs to function at 100-percent?</strong></em></p>
<p>How about your gut? Is it in perfect balance? And your mental health&#8230; how is it holding up these days?</p>
<p>The truth is, most of us know that we aren’t doing everything we should do to take care of ourselves. We rationalize and reassure with wishful thinking rather than actual truth.</p>
<p>Now more than ever, it is essential to take a step back and take a long (very honest) look at how healthy you REALLY are and seek ways to be healthier.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>There isn’t a better time to self-reflect on this… than WORLD HEALTH DAY!</strong></em></p>

<p>Every year the <a href="https://www.who.int" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">World Health Organization (WHO)</a> deems April 7th as World Health Day.<br />
A global health awareness day focused on promoting healthy living habits that promote human health and well-being.</p>
<p>When it comes to health … <em><strong>your number one goal should be taking steps to be PROactive instead of REactive.</strong></em></p>
<p>Hand washing, coughing into your elbow, limiting potential exposure to germs, and other common-sense practices are indeed important… <em><strong>but there are other things you must do to ensure you are healthy and provide support to help keep your immune system strong!</strong></em></p>
<p>Our team here at V Shred and Sculpt Nation brainstormed to expand on the “health tips” you are hearing day in and day out.</p>
<p>We hope that the additional information we are providing within each of these tips will help you out during a time where proactive health measures are more important than ever!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>5 PROACTIVE WAYS TO STAY HEALTHY</strong></p>
<p><strong>(1) Get Enough Quality Sleep</strong></p>
<p><img class="wp-image-6950 size-full" src="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_274003412-1.jpeg?resize=1170%2C780&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1170" height="780" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_274003412-1.jpeg?w=5760&amp;ssl=1 5760w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_274003412-1.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_274003412-1.jpeg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_274003412-1.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_274003412-1.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_274003412-1.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1170px) 100vw, 1170px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>We know sleep is important, yet it’s often the first thing we sacrifice to fit everything into our hectic schedules.</p>
<p>Sleep is essential if you want your brain and body to work at full capacity. Not getting enough shut-eye trickles down into every other part of your life.</p>
<p>In terms of immune health, studies show sleep deprivation can impact your immune system, leaving your defenses down and slowing recovery from workouts..</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-6969" src="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/burn-pm-fat-blog-fb-info60.png?resize=1024%2C1024&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="1024" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/burn-pm-fat-blog-fb-info60.png?resize=1024%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/burn-pm-fat-blog-fb-info60.png?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 150w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/burn-pm-fat-blog-fb-info60.png?resize=300%2C300&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/burn-pm-fat-blog-fb-info60.png?resize=768%2C768&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/burn-pm-fat-blog-fb-info60.png?resize=60%2C60&amp;ssl=1 60w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/burn-pm-fat-blog-fb-info60.png?w=1080&amp;ssl=1 1080w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>Being exhausted can also affect your ability to lose weight, especially stubborn fat. This is primarily because not getting enough shut-eye has a significant impact on your hormones.</p>
<p>Your stress hormone cortisol goes into overdrive when you don’t get enough sleep. Excess production of cortisol can lead to some unpleasant effects, including weight gain, inefficient immune system function, and digestive issues.</p>
<p>Your “hunger hormones” (leptin and ghrelin) are also thrown off. Leptin decreases hunger and ghrelin stimulates your appetite. If you aren’t getting enough sleep, ghrelin spikes, and leptin plummets. This leaves you hungry (even if you aren’t) and more prone to make unhealthy choices.</p>
<p>You want to INCREASE your leptin levels. The way to do that is… deep sleep.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>Sleep quality matters just as much as how long you are sleeping!</strong></em><br />
<em><strong>Restless sleep is not fat-burning &amp; immune-supporting sleep!!</strong></em></p>
<p>Your best defense is a supplement that will not only help you fall asleep but get you into that restful deep sleep your body needs to balance these hormones.</p>
<p><a href="https://sculptnation.com/products/burn-pm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sculpt Nation BURN PM</a> does just that!</p>

<p>Many of our routines are thrown off right now. This makes sticking to our usual sleep schedule difficult. It is important that you keep a regular bedtime and wake time to stabilize your sleep.</p>
<p>Our bodies crave consistency… <a href="https://sculptnation.com/products/burn-pm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BURN PM</a> will help you wind down so that you can get to bed at your usual time.</p>
<p>Everyone&#8217;s sleep requirements are different. The general suggestion is to get between 7-9 hours of sleep every night.</p>
<p><strong>(2) Exercise Regularly</strong></p>

<p>Something else that will help you sleep better and feel better .. is exercise!</p>
<p>For decades, researchers have investigated how exercise affects the immune system.<br />
Most agree that a little bit of activity every day will help maintain a healthy immune system.</p>
<p>You don’t need to live in the gym 24/7 to reap the endless health benefits of exercise.<br />
Simply going for a daily walk or jog can be a great first step.</p>
<p>However, to see the most health benefits, it&#8217;s important to get in 30 minutes of some sort of physical activity every day. A few days a week, incorporate longer exercise sessions that incorporate strength training.</p>
<p>These strength training sessions <em><strong>do not need to be at a gym.</strong></em></p>
<p>Training at home is the only option for many people. And right now, home workouts are something we are all having to adapt to.</p>
<p>It only takes a few small purchases, or even just a little creativity using items lying around your house, and you can build your own home gym!</p>
<p>It can be overwhelming trying to figure out how to make the most of your home workouts, especially if you are used to having access to fancy gym equipment.</p>
<p><em><strong>We’ve got you covered!</strong></em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLIZtutUcGbA2cA3OW88Id6qgaEi2i2rjK" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-6953 size-full" src="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/YT-athomeworkout-GIF-blog.gif?resize=600%2C600&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="600" height="600" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>Over on our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCOFCwvhDoUvYcfpD7RJKQwA" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">YouTube channel</a>, we have a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLIZtutUcGbA2cA3OW88Id6qgaEi2i2rjK" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FREE At Home Playlist</a>. It includes <strong>over 60 WORKOUTS that you can do from home!</strong> You do not even need equipment for these sweat sessions!</p>
<p>This HOME WORKOUT PLAYLIST is in addition to the thousands of workout tips, videos, and full follow-along workouts we already have on the channel. Again .. ALL FOR FREE!</p>

<p><strong>(3) Follow A Sustainable Nutrient-Rich Diet</strong></p>
<p>Most people see the word diet and picture a plate full of nothing but bland lean protein and green vegetables and believe that is what it takes to be healthy.</p>
<p>You do not need to starve yourself, and you do not need to restrict food groups. <em><strong>Doing these things is the opposite of “healthy” and will almost always backfire!</strong></em></p>
<p>In terms of fat loss, in most cases, you will need to eat in a caloric deficit to lose body fat.<br />
If you aren’t sure where to start, try using our free macro calculator tool that will tell you exactly how many proteins, carbs and calories you should consume a day to reach your fitness goals. <a href="https://vshred.com/sp/survey/survey-aka1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Use our free macro calculator tool here.</a></p>
<p>Just know that reaching your goals does not mean you need to fall victim to a fad diet. These types of eating plans are usually <em><strong>the opposite of healthy.</strong></em></p>
<p>You can still eat foods you enjoy as long as you prioritize nutrient-rich foods that are not overly processed. Focus on eating a variety of fruits and vegetables, lean proteins, whole grains, and healthy fats.</p>
<p>The biggest hole we see in most people&#8217;s attempts to “eat healthy” is lack of diversity.</p>
<p>Even if you manage to consume enough quality fruits and vegetables, you probably stick to the same 3 or 4 that you enjoy the most.</p>
<p><a href="https://sculptnation.com/products/greens" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sculpt Nation Greens</a> provides a diverse profile of veggies and nutrients all at once. In addition to those micronutrients your body needs, our <a href="https://sculptnation.com/products/greens" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GREENS</a> are packed with collagen, alkalizing greens, adaptogenic herbs, and antioxidants</p>

<p><strong>(4) Focus On Mental Health</strong></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-6956 size-full" src="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_318189902.jpeg?resize=1170%2C780&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1170" height="780" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_318189902.jpeg?w=8688&amp;ssl=1 8688w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_318189902.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_318189902.jpeg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_318189902.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_318189902.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_318189902.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1170px) 100vw, 1170px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>The World Health Organization defines health as… “a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being.”</p>
<p>Take a moment today to ask yourself how you are feeling MENTALLY!</p>
<p>A healthy body is not going to do you much good if you do not have control of your mental health.</p>
<p><em><strong>In fact, it may be impossible.</strong></em></p>
<p>Mental health and physical health are very connected. If you aren’t in a good headspace, you will be less likely to start (and then stick) with healthy behaviors.</p>
<p>On the flip side, when you aren&#8217;t physically healthy or have negative body-image issues&#8230; this can have a serious impact on your mental health.</p>
<p>Don’t wait until you are in “crisis mode” to make mental health a priority. Start forming healthy mental habits today that will help you cope better with stress that pops up in the future.</p>
<p><img class="size-large wp-image-6975" src="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_220239371.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_220239371.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_220239371.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_220239371.jpeg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_220239371.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_220239371.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><strong>Here are a few things that may help you out….</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Talk To Someone</strong><br />
Seeking help is a sign of strength, not weakness. Whether it is a professional or a trusted friend, do not keep your emotions locked up inside.</li>
<li><strong>Be Positive</strong><br />
Negative thoughts will quickly put you in a bitter mood. Researchers found that long term pessimists had an almost 20 percent higher risk of dying than those who were optimistic! No matter how bleak things appear, there is ALWAYS a silver lining. Seek the positive and try your best to focus on that!</li>
<li><strong>Find Things To Be Grateful For</strong><br />
It’s no surprise that researchers found that people who focused on gratitude (even as little as once a week) were happier and had fewer physical complaints! One study even found that expressing gratitude may have LONG lasting effects on the brain. Speak things you are grateful for, write a gratitude letter, or keep a gratitude journal!</li>
<li><strong>Help Others</strong><br />
We are hardwired to love! Doing something kind for someone else will leave you with “feel good” emotions that will positively impact your own self-esteem!</li>
<li><strong>Improve Your Life Outlook</strong><br />
Try meditating, mindfulness, positive affirmations, and/or prayer. These practices can provide instant stress relief. Over time, they can help make positive thinking more automatic.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>(5) Prioritize Gut Health</strong></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-6957 size-full" src="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/are-probiotics-the-key-to-unlocking-fat-loss-Blog-Gif-SN.gif?resize=600%2C338&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="600" height="338" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>If your gut health isn’t optimal, your immune system can’t be either. 70-80% of the cells that make up your immune system reside in your gut wall!</p>
<p>Immune support is only one reason you need to place a high emphasis on gut health.</p>
<p>Did you know your gut is the only organ that has it’s very own nervous system?! It has more neurotransmitters than your brain! A healthy gut is crucial for optimal mental health and brain function.</p>
<p>Your gut also houses a second set of genes (that many call the second genome) that you probably didn’t even realize you have! These are not the same genetics passed down from your parents. You have the ability to change these genes. But like the genes you can’t change, <em><strong>your second genome can impact the way your body looks, feels, and functions.</strong></em></p>
<p>Inside your gut is over three pounds of bacteria… known as your gut microbiome.<br />
Many things can cause unhealthy bacteria to populate and take over.</p>
<ul>
<li>Age</li>
<li>Stress</li>
<li>A Poor Diet</li>
<li>Not Enough <a href="https://sculptnation.com/products/enzymes" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Digestive Enzymes</a></li>
<li>Environmental Toxins</li>
<li>+ More</li>
</ul>
<p>Too much harmful gut bacteria and not enough good bacteria <em><strong>can result in serious trouble for your health and waistline!</strong></em></p>
<p>The good news is that you are in complete control and can change your gut flora!<br />
<em><strong>You simply need to feed it&#8230; GOOD bacteria!</strong></em></p>
<p>The easiest and best way to achieve this is by taking a <a href="https://sculptnation.com/products/probiotics" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">QUALITY PROBIOTIC</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://sculptnation.com/products/probiotics" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-6964 size-full" src="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Probiotics-WorldHealthDay-Blog.gif?resize=600%2C600&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="600" height="600" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>We didn’t cut any corners when developing our formula for <a href="https://sculptnation.com/products/probiotics" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sculpt Nation Probiotics</a>. We spent years looking at scientific studies on gut health.</p>
<p>We wanted to make sure we included the right strains in the right amounts.<br />
<em><strong>It had to be THE BEST on the market.</strong></em></p>
<p>The result is a blend that contains 7 different live probiotics, as well as a prebiotic. This is an important combo because probiotics can’t do their job unless they are fed. The prebiotic in our blend is a special kind of fiber that acts as a fertilizer. It feeds the probiotics what they need&#8230; to work!</p>
<p>A healthy gut is essential for overall GI health, energy balance, emotional support, optimal brain health, and immune support.</p>
<p>Take one capsule of <a href="https://sculptnation.com/products/probiotics" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sculpt Nation Probiotics</a> a day to get your gut back in balance! The result will be better digestion, promoting a more robust immune system, and support for an easier time losing weight!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>Prevention can’t be preached enough!</strong></em></p>
<p>The most important relationship you will ever be in is the one you have with your own body!<br />
Take a look at the stay healthy checklist above and be brutally honest with yourself about the areas where you know you need to improve.</p>
<p>Vow that you will begin to consistently incorporate these ”5 Stay Healthy Tips” and encourage those around you to do the same!</p>
<p>Having people hold you accountable, offer advice, and give you ideas to stay happy and healthy&#8230; is a great way to remain positive and stick with your wellness goals.</p>

<p>Even if you aren’t Irish… chances are someone is trying to get you to head out to a St. Patrick&#8217;s Day party.</p>
<p>After all, it is the fourth most popular drinking holiday here in the U.S.</p>
<p>There will be endless green beer on tap, shots of Irish whiskey, and sugary green drinks galore… creating the perfect storm… <em><strong>for the worst post St. Patrick’s aftermath ever!</strong></em></p>
<p>If you wake up feeling beat down, dehydrated, and still worn out, the last thing you will feel like doing is hitting the gym.</p>
<p>But <strong>THE RIGHT SWEAT SESSION</strong> could be the perfect <strong>POST ST. PATRICK’S STRATEGY !!</strong></p>
<p>We have THREE workout options for you to choose from.</p>
<p><strong>You will get those in a second…</strong>We have to convince you to get out of bed first!!</p>
<p>Let’s talk about what a big night can do to your body and how exercise can help!</p>
<p><strong>Several things can occur….</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Dehydration:</strong> Your body will try to “keep up” by increasing urine production.) This is also why you end up feeling beat down and dried out &#8212; you are super dehydrated.</li>
<li><strong>Upset Stomach:</strong> Your stomach is a wreck, and you feel nauseous mainly because you have irritated your stomach lining.</li>
<li><strong>Body Aches/Food Cravings</strong>: Your blood sugar also may have hit rock-bottom, which would explain why you feel so beat up or have cravings for greasy foods.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Here is where you find yourself SWEARING that you will never go out again!!</strong></p>
<p><strong>HOW DO YOU MAKE IT GO AWAY?!!</strong></p>
<p>Before you even consider working up a sweat with one of the workouts we are giving you&#8230; you have to work through some of the damage done.</p>
<p>You may not feel like eating … but your body is begging you for nutrients.</p>
<p>Your biggest defense might be some <a href="https://sculptnation.com/products/bcaas">BCAAs</a> and Electrolytes, but this combo should actually be consumed BEFORE a big night!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>What we are about to share could actually fight or block the Post St. Patrick’s Aftermath!</strong></p>
<p>Before you go out .. before you pass out .. and as soon as you wake up after a big night out .. pound some BCAAs and electrolytes!</p>
<p>As mentioned, you may wake up feeling dehydrated.</p>
<p>Try adding a scoop of <a href="https://sculptnation.com/products/bcaas">Sculpt Nation BCAAS</a> to a zero or low-calorie electrolyte based drink. The electrolytes and vitamins combined with the essential amino acids and mineral complex found in <a href="https://sculptnation.com/products/bcaas">Sculpt Nation BCAAS</a> may help keep you from feeling … as crappy.</p>
<p>Our next tip …We want you to <strong>drink ANOTHER GREEN DRINK!!</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://sculptnation.com/products/greens"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-6852 size-full" src="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Greens-gif-blog.gif?resize=450%2C917&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="450" height="917" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

<p>After you have done some damage control <em>(and only if you feel hydrated enough)</em> .. you can try to get moving.</p>
<p><strong>How will a workout help get back in the game?</strong></p>
<p>In addition to just getting you out of bed and stimulating blood flow…. The night out may have slowed the release of endorphins, the feel-good hormones that can help regulate your mood. Moving your body and getting some exercise, even when you don’t necessarily feel like it, can help stimulate the release of endorphins, resulting in a better mood and a better state of mind.</p>
<p>You should use caution exercising following a big night out. If you went way overboard, it is probably best to just call it a rest day!</p>
<p>But if you feel up for it, while exercise won’t help you fully bounce back, it can counteract some of the effects, and help you feel human again ..getting you back to your scheduled lifts .. faster!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>HERE ARE THE THREE WORKOUTS</strong><br />
<em><strong>**pick one based on how bad the aftermath is**</strong></em></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-6849 size-large" src="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/AdobeStock_239063100.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/AdobeStock_239063100.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/AdobeStock_239063100.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/AdobeStock_239063100.jpeg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/AdobeStock_239063100.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/AdobeStock_239063100.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>MAJOR BEATDOWN &#8211; Yoga &amp; Stretching.</strong><br />
Yoga may be your best bet because it’s gentle but still gets your body moving.<br />
Crawl out of bed (or just stay there) and do a short 10-minute full-body stretch or yoga sequence. Something is better than nothing! Keep it nice and slow, and you may want to avoid inversions, which is anything where your head goes below your heart.</p>
<p><strong>MODERATE BEATDOWN &#8211; Low Impact Cardio.</strong><br />
You may not feel like pounding the pavement or jumping up and down, but a nice slow walk, swim, or cycle, will help get your blood flowing and give you a nice endorphin release. Just jump on a treadmill, bike, cybex, elliptical .. or even better get some fresh air and go on a walk outside … for at least 20 min!</p>
<p><strong>LIGHT BEATDOWN &#8211; Light Full Body Circuit.</strong><br />
If you are feeling up for more than just some low to moderate movement, try a short, really basic full-body circuit workout.</p>
<p>One exercise per body part, just a couple sets of each in a moderate rep range, using lighter weight, bands, or even just body-weight.</p>
<p><em><strong>An example may be:</strong></em></p>
<ul>
<li>Leg Extensions or Air Squats</li>
<li>Hamstring Curls or Walking Lunges</li>
<li>Calf Raises</li>
<li>Bicep Curls</li>
<li>Bench Dips</li>
<li>DB Chest Press</li>
<li>Lat Pull Downs</li>
<li>Sit-Ups</li>
<li>Rest and REPEAT for another round or two!</li>
</ul>
<p>We have tons of short workouts like this on our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/vshred">YouTube Channel</a> that don’t require the gym at all .. so you can stay at home and sweat it out.</p>
<p><strong>Save this article and use each <em>“phase”</em> over the days to come!</strong></p>
<p>Whether you plan to sweat it out post-party, take it easy, or wait and see what the dreaded day after holds … your body may be wiped out for more than one day! You may want to start with the Light Workout and work your way up!</p>
<p>We hope this blog and these workouts give you an idea of how you can still stay on track… <em>even after a night of bad decisions!!</em></p>

<p>Whey protein has long been a go-to for anyone looking to improve their body… and with good reason. Refueling your body with a high-quality protein post-workout is the fastest, easiest way to avoid falling into a catabolic (muscle wasting) state after training.</p>
<p>Whey acts fast to get into your system and begin repairing damaged muscle cells while building new muscle fibers.</p>
<p>The run-off product from cheese and yogurt making, whey was once discarded as useless&#8230; Until research scientists stumbled upon the fact that whey does some amazing things in your body.</p>
<p><strong>Whey has helped people:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Burn fat faster</li>
<li>Maintain muscle while dieting</li>
<li>Improve strength</li>
<li>Increase lean, metabolism-boosting muscle mass</li>
<li>Boost immune function</li>
<li>So, why whey and not soy, meat, or vegetable proteins?</li>
</ul>
<p>Basically, your body absorbs whey proteins better than any other source. Whey scores the highest on the Biological Value (BV) scale. This means you absorb more protein per serving with whey then you do with any other protein source.</p>
<p><strong>IF… you consume the right type of whey protein.</strong></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-6822" src="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/FB-NPD-female-quote-style.jpg-copy-copy.jpg?resize=1024%2C1024&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="1024" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/FB-NPD-female-quote-style.jpg-copy-copy.jpg?resize=1024%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/FB-NPD-female-quote-style.jpg-copy-copy.jpg?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 150w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/FB-NPD-female-quote-style.jpg-copy-copy.jpg?resize=300%2C300&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/FB-NPD-female-quote-style.jpg-copy-copy.jpg?resize=768%2C768&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/FB-NPD-female-quote-style.jpg-copy-copy.jpg?resize=60%2C60&amp;ssl=1 60w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/FB-NPD-female-quote-style.jpg-copy-copy.jpg?w=1080&amp;ssl=1 1080w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Sugary Floor Sweepings <em>AKA</em> Whey Protein Concentrate</strong></p>
<p>All those low-cost protein powders lining the shelves of big-box stores like Walmart, Costco, and Target are, more than likely, jam-packed with whey protein concentrate (WPC).</p>
<p>It sounds good&#8230;After all, whey is good. And protein concentrate sounds like super strong, concentrated proteins for your body. But here’s the problem…</p>
<p>Those protein powders are really cheap because the whey inside is, for the most part, nothing more than sweetened floor sweepings.</p>
<p>Whey Protein Concentrate (WPC) is a low-cost, low-quality form of whey that finds its way into cheap powders and protein bars. The problem with WPC? It has an extremely low bioavailability score. This means your body only digests, and is able to use, a small percentage of the protein.</p>
<p>The rest is simply passed off as waste.</p>
<p>Not only that, but WPC actually has fewer protein grams per serving than superior forms of whey that work with your body to burn fat and build muscle. For example, some WPC products can contain as low as 34% protein per serving. That means, each scoop contains only 34% protein, the rest is carbs, fat, ash, and lactose.</p>
<p>Think of it this way… that cheap 3lb container of protein isn’t so cheap when you consider that as little as 34% of it is actually protein. <strong>That means over 2lbs of that powder is NOT protein</strong>&#8230;.pretty scary right?</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>The Fastest, Easiest Whey to Your Dream Body 90% Whey Protein Isolate</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://sculptnation.com/mv-protein-lp-v1"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-6831 size-large" src="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Protein-PRODAY40.jpg?resize=1024%2C1024&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="1024" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Protein-PRODAY40.jpg?resize=1024%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Protein-PRODAY40.jpg?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 150w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Protein-PRODAY40.jpg?resize=300%2C300&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Protein-PRODAY40.jpg?resize=768%2C768&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Protein-PRODAY40.jpg?resize=60%2C60&amp;ssl=1 60w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Protein-PRODAY40.jpg?w=1080&amp;ssl=1 1080w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

<p><em><strong>Will You Win Or Lose This Super Bowl Sunday?</strong></em></p>
<p>As the 49ers and Chiefs battle it out on the field, many of you will face your own game day battle&#8230; and we’ve got your defensive strategy!</p>
<p>You made it past the new year’s resolution hump <em>(the point when most people have already failed)</em> and are smashing your goals.</p>
<p><strong>Then… FOUL!!</strong></p>
<p>You are faced with an (unofficial) American holiday that is celebrated with lots of food.</p>
<p>Super Bowl Sunday is the second biggest food consumption day of the year! The only day that scores more calories is Thanksgiving.</p>
<p><strong>Here is what goes down in a matter of only a few hours&#8230;</strong></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-6687 size-large" src="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/AdobeStock_317072671-1.jpeg?resize=1024%2C672&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="672" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/AdobeStock_317072671-1.jpeg?resize=1024%2C672&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/AdobeStock_317072671-1.jpeg?resize=300%2C197&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/AdobeStock_317072671-1.jpeg?resize=768%2C504&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/AdobeStock_317072671-1.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/AdobeStock_317072671-1.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<ul>
<li>1.3 Billion Chicken Wings</li>
<li>2 Million Pizzas</li>
<li>10 Million Pounds of Ribs</li>
<li>88 Million Pounds of Cheese</li>
<li>9200 Tons of Chips</li>
<li>3 Million Pounds of Nuts</li>
<li>325.5 Million Gallons of Beer</li>
</ul>
<p>And that’s just a breakdown of the most popular Super Bowl foods!</p>
<p>So yeah, it’s safe to say that a calorie surplus is in the playbook for many Americans.</p>
<p>While we always preach that <em>“one meal”</em> or even <em>“one day”</em> of eating off your diet plan won’t hurt your overall progress, we’ll let you do the math on how this one day could be an exception.</p>
<p><em><strong>If we know that&#8230;</strong></em></p>
<p>A SURPLUS of 3,500 calories = 1 pound of weight gain.</p>
<p><em><strong>And it is estimated that…</strong></em></p>
<p>The average calories a person will consume on Super Bowl Sunday is 6,000!</p>
<p>It’s easy to see how scrambling back and forth to the buffet table could indeed result in a major poundage penalty, and we want to make sure you are ready to tackle the day!</p>
<p>It may seem like you can’t win unless you sit this one out on the sidelines, but being focused on losing weight does not mean you have to lose out on all the fun, or food!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>FOOLPROOF SUPER BOWL STRATEGY</strong></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-6675 size-large" src="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/superbowl-vince-01.png?resize=1024%2C1024&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="1024" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/superbowl-vince-01.png?resize=1024%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/superbowl-vince-01.png?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 150w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/superbowl-vince-01.png?resize=300%2C300&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/superbowl-vince-01.png?resize=768%2C768&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/superbowl-vince-01.png?resize=60%2C60&amp;ssl=1 60w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/superbowl-vince-01.png?w=1080&amp;ssl=1 1080w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>First… PICK A TEAM</strong><br />
When game day arrives, you should have a plan that starts with deciding which team you are going to be on.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Team <em>“Live-A-Little”</em> VS. Team <em>“Stick-To-The-Plan”</em></strong></p>
<p>We are placing our bets on&#8230;<strong> TEAM LIVE A LITTLE!</strong><br />
That’s because the odds are against you if you tell yourself you aren’t <em>“allowed”</em> to eat something. It is better to go slightly off your plan and practice mindfulness.</p>
<p>Sure, there is the risk that once you get a<em> “taste,”</em> you won’t be able to stop eating, but you have to learn to have willpower at some point. Let’s start mastering that right now!</p>
<p>Your goal is to walk in with a winning attitude.</p>
<p>You can’t let yourself feel ANY guilt about your decision to live a little. Next, you have to trust yourself to be disciplined enough to use mindfulness and moderation to avoid going overboard.</p>
<p><strong>Next… Your Pre-game plan.</strong></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-6719" src="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/superbowl-pregame-blog.png?resize=1024%2C1024&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="1024" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/superbowl-pregame-blog.png?resize=1024%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/superbowl-pregame-blog.png?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 150w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/superbowl-pregame-blog.png?resize=300%2C300&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/superbowl-pregame-blog.png?resize=768%2C768&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/superbowl-pregame-blog.png?resize=60%2C60&amp;ssl=1 60w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/superbowl-pregame-blog.png?w=1080&amp;ssl=1 1080w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><strong>Prepare A Healthy Dish</strong><br />
If you are hosting a party, then you have complete control and can modify almost every snack to be healthy or healthier! If you are attending a party, ask if you can bring something.</p>
<p><strong>Get In Your Workout</strong><br />
Get in your sweat session before the big game. If you tell yourself you’ll do it afterward; you are no doubt setting yourself up to lose!</p>
<p>Add a quick HIIT cardio session on to the end of your lift, like this one, and you will have the perks of that <em>“after-burn effect”</em> that continues well past the final Super Bowl buzzer!</p>
<p><strong>Do Not Calorie Hoard</strong><br />
While it may be tempting to save all your calories or starve yourself in preparation for a food surplus, that is overall a bad idea. Going to the party hungry will NO DOUBT lead to over-eating. At the same time, there is nothing wrong with saving some calories and being mindful in the hours leading up to the big game.</p>
<p>You can do this by having lower carb/fat meals and sticking with mainly lean proteins beforehand. Make sure you have a meal right before the festivities. Fill up a shaker with a <a href="https://sculptnation.com/products/protein">Sculpt Nation Protein</a> smoothie and drink up on your way there!</p>
<p><strong>Get A Good Night Of Sleep</strong><br />
Sleep deprivation not only gets your hormones out of whack, but grogginess also leads to bad decisions, such as overeating! Aim for 7-9 hours of shut-eye the night before the game!</p>
<p>If you need some help falling and staying asleep, you may want to look into a natural remedy, like <a href="https://sculptnation.com/products/burn-pm">Sculpt Nation BURN PM</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Supplement</strong><br />
You can get a head-start before those cravings ever kick in by adding in an appetite suppressant like <a href="https://sculptnation.com/products/burn">Sculpt Nation BURN.</a></p>
<p>You can grab the supplements mentioned above for <strong>30% OFF</strong> now through Superbowl Sunday when you use <strong>code: SUPER30</strong> at checkout! <a href="https://sculptnation.com/products">Click Here to shop.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://sculptnation.com/products"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-6676 size-full" src="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/1-Superbowl-Blog-giphy.gif?resize=480%2C480&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="480" height="480" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Now It’s Time For KICK-OFF… Implement This 5 Step Defensive Strategy</strong></p>
<p><strong>Survey the spread</strong><br />
Take a look at all your options. Think about what is in each dish, what may be the healthiest option and the most filling. Take a moment to ask yourself what you are really craving. Just because it is on the table doesn’t mean it has to make its way to your plate!</p>
<p><strong>Dive in with mindfulness and moderation</strong><br />
Let’s start with beverages. Drink LOTS of water and unless you can’t fathom game day without a beer or two, pass on empty calories found in alcoholic beverages. If you must have alcohol, opt for a light beer, or liquor paired with calorie-free mixers.</p>
<p>When it comes to food, fill the majority of your plate with lots of veggies and any proteins that aren’t battered, fried, or cheese covered. Then when it comes to the good stuff, skip anything that you aren’t DYING to have and include small portions of only the things you REALLY want.</p>
<p><strong>Avoid “BLT’S”</strong><br />
We aren’t talking about the sandwich. We are talking about those little bites, licks, and tastes. A handful of chips as you pass by the bowl, just one more piece of pizza, only a small taste of that buffalo dip, and sneaking a cube of cheese every time you pass by, could easily ALL ADD UP to a full day worth of calories (or more.)</p>
<p>One way to avoid “grazing” is after you make your plate, instead of eating everything all at once, nibble off of the plate you made for yourself. Once it’s empty .. that’s it, no more!</p>
<p><strong>Stay away from the buffet</strong><br />
The problem with parties is that the food stays out for hours! It’s always there waiting for you to have a BLT! Avoidance is the best strategy. After you fill your plate walk away and DO NOT RETURN!</p>
<p>Drink water, chew gum, stay occupied! Whatever you do, don’t head back into that penalty zone! Remember to graze off your plate, not the food spread!</p>
<p><strong>Actually watch the game</strong><br />
And the commercials..and the half-time show…Remember WHY you are surrounded by all that food to begin. Get into the game, jump up and down, and cheer on your team.</p>
<p>If you aren’t into sports but are going to a party anyway, find other ways to stay busy by keeping the conversation going with friends or even ask someone to take it outside for some yard games or a walk around the block. If you are busy socializing, you won’t be thinking about casually making your way back to the buffet!</p>
<p><em><strong>THE GAME IS OVER … Do Not Penalize Yourself</strong></em></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-6722" src="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/superbowl-game-over.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/superbowl-game-over.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/superbowl-game-over.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/superbowl-game-over.jpeg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/superbowl-game-over.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/superbowl-game-over.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /><br />
Even if your team wins, if you lost your food battle, you will most likely wake up on Monday with a flood of negative thoughts.</p>
<p>This is <strong>NEVER</strong> a good place to be!</p>
<p>Feelings of guilt can cause you to do some crazy things, like give up altogether, or think you have no chance at bouncing back.</p>
<p>DO NOT let these thoughts cause you to give up! Let’s use one of the biggest Super Bowl blunders of all time as an example.</p>
<p>At Super Bowl XXXVII, just as the game was coming to an end, the Panthers managed to tie the score. But then John Kasey booted the kickoff out of bounds, giving the Patriots the ball at their own 40-yard line, allowing Tom Brady to step in and win the game!</p>
<p>Do you think Kasey called it quits and retired because of one bad plan? NO!! He went on to play seven more seasons with the Panthers.</p>
<p>Whatever choices you made, do not replay your game-day decisions. You consumed it… MOVE ON!</p>
<p>And by move on, we DO NOT mean that you should attempt any kind of “damage control.” You can not and should not try to restrict calories or attempt to punish yourself in an attempt to “work off” the calories you consumed.</p>
<p>I mean, come on, what are you gonna do? Run 60 miles?? That is more than two back-to-back marathons, yet that is what it would take to even <em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">potentially</span></em> “burn” six thousand extra calories!</p>
<p>Don’t let your mind go there! It’s not healthy, and the outcome will BACKFIRE!</p>
<p>Even if you attempt to “work off” the calories consumed, all you will really do is stress out your body. This could wreak havoc on your hormones and hinder your body&#8217;s ability to recover properly. These things can actually stall weight-loss or even cause weight gain!</p>
<p>The best plan of action is to just <strong>GET BACK ON TRACK</strong>!</p>
<p>A great way to get back on track fast is with the help of Sculpt Nation’s fat-melting, muscle building supplements.</p>

<p>Did you know that all of the <em>POSITIVE</em> things you do to get your body in tip-top shape could be having a <em>NEGATIVE</em> impact on your overall health?</p>
<p>Don’t take this the wrong way. The health hazard we are about to tell you about happens to people of any age, weight, or fitness level! This is because the majority of what causes it is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">unavoidable</span>!</p>
<p>Losing fat, building lean muscle, killing it in the gym, and following a diet is GOOD. This information is far from your “get out of jail free card” to stop doing these things. However, what we are about to discuss may very well be THE REASON you aren’t seeing optimal results, despite your efforts!</p>
<p>You see, even GOOD things like diet and training could potentially backfire and create a BAD thing called OXIDATIVE STRESS. This type of stress happens when <em><strong>free radicals</strong></em> and antioxidants in your body are out of balance.</p>
<p>Since we are regularly exposed to <em><strong>free radicals</strong></em>, even if you never step on a treadmill, lift a weight, or follow a meal plan, you are still at high risk for this type of oxidative stress.</p>
<p>In fact, NOT exercising and eating nutritious food can also create a domino effect that could cause you to produce .. you guessed it .. excess free radicals!!</p>
<p><img class="size-large wp-image-6651" src="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/AdobeStock_295860038.jpeg?resize=1024%2C480&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="480" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/AdobeStock_295860038.jpeg?resize=1024%2C480&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/AdobeStock_295860038.jpeg?resize=300%2C141&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/AdobeStock_295860038.jpeg?resize=768%2C360&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/AdobeStock_295860038.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/AdobeStock_295860038.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><strong>What are <em>FREE RADICALS?</em></strong><br />
We won’t get into some boring chemistry lesson. All you need to know is that free radicals are unstable molecules, and too many of them can damage the cells in your body. Whatever organ a cell belongs to won’t function properly if this happens.</p>
<p>Our bodies are home to over <strong>37 trillion cells</strong> that control everything we do! The health of our cells dictates the appearance of our hair and skin, determines our mood, impacts the gut, regulates metabolism, etc. So you can see how an excess of free radicals could severely negatively impact you .. physically, mentally, and aesthetically!</p>
<p>Sometimes we are the ones responsible for creating this imbalance….</p>
<ul>
<li>Train too much = excess free radicals.</li>
<li>Don’t sleep enough = excess free radicals.</li>
<li>Have an overly restrictive diet and/or inadequate nutrition = excess free radicals.</li>
<li>Eat too many fried or processed foods = excess free radicals.</li>
<li>Stress/Anxiety = excess free radicals.</li>
<li>Smoking = excess free radicals.</li>
<li>Drinking too much alcohol = excess free radicals.</li>
<li>+MORE</li>
</ul>
<p>But there are other ways free radicals are produced in the body that we can’t avoid entirely&#8230;.</p>
<ul>
<li>Exposure to toxins/chemicals</li>
<li>Pesticides</li>
<li>Radiation</li>
<li>Pollutants</li>
<li>Solvents</li>
<li>Secondhand cigarette smoke</li>
<li>+MORE</li>
</ul>
<p>In short, whether you are in our control of them or not, when free radicals take over the body, cells become exhausted and STOP functioning properly.</p>
<p>Over time, what happens next is something called… <em><strong>CELLULAR BURNOUT!!</strong></em></p>
<p><img class="size-large wp-image-6649" src="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/AdobeStock_212626161.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/AdobeStock_212626161.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/AdobeStock_212626161.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/AdobeStock_212626161.jpeg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/AdobeStock_212626161.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/AdobeStock_212626161.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This creates a host of NEGATIVE side effects…..</p>
<ul>
<li>Fatigue</li>
<li>Lacking Endurance/Stamina</li>
<li>Bloating/Constipation</li>
<li>Low Sex Drive</li>
<li>Lackluster Skin</li>
<li>Brittle Hair &amp; Nails</li>
<li>Stalled Weight Loss</li>
<li>Fat Gain</li>
<li>Trouble Sleeping</li>
<li>Anxiety</li>
<li>Brain Fog</li>
<li>+ MUCH MORE</li>
</ul>
<p>You are probably experiencing many of these symptoms but have been unable to pinpoint the reason why. Now you know, it is most likely because of something you have likely never even heard of .. and that is <em><strong>CELLULAR BURNOUT!</strong></em></p>
<p>To make matters worse, as the body ages, it loses its ability to fight the effects of free radicals.</p>
<p><em><strong>The good news is that it’s not too late!</strong></em></p>
<p>You can fix CELLULAR BURNOUT by focusing on something called CELLULAR OPTIMIZATION.</p>
<p>Your body is a sum of its cells. This means that the healthier your cells are, the better you will look and feel. The problem is that you aren’t giving your cells what they need to be optimal.</p>
<p><img class="size-large wp-image-6652" src="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/AdobeStock_298726227.jpeg?resize=1024%2C768&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="768" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/AdobeStock_298726227.jpeg?resize=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/AdobeStock_298726227.jpeg?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/AdobeStock_298726227.jpeg?resize=768%2C576&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/AdobeStock_298726227.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/AdobeStock_298726227.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em><strong>How do we know this?</strong></em></p>
<p>Even the BEST DIET can not provide the fuel our cells need to THRIVE and cancel out all these excess free radicals. Add on all the stressors placed on your body (mentioned above), and a domino effect occurs until eventually your cells stop cooperating and TOTALLY BURNOUT!</p>
<p><strong>So how exactly can you OPTIMIZE the trillions of different cells in your body?</strong><br />
Simply put, you need to replace the BAD FUEL you are giving your cells (stress, processed foods, pollutants, etc.) with CLEAN FUEL (vitamins, minerals, antioxidants, etc.)</p>
<p><em><strong>You may be thinking…</strong></em><br />
<em>“Well, that is easy! I’ll just eat healthily, get enough sleep, and make sure I take a multivitamin.”</em></p>
<p><strong>Not so fast&#8230;</strong><br />
When it comes to CELLULAR BURNOUT, eating healthy, taking vitamins, and getting sleep, just won’t cut it!!</p>
<p>SCIENCE PROVES that our cells need VERY SPECIFIC superfoods in VERY SPECIFIC dosages to thrive.</p>
<p>This is exactly why our team at V Shred and Sculpt Nation has spent years, as well as hundreds of thousands of dollars, to come up with THE PERFECT SOLUTION to beat and treat cellular burnout!</p>
<p>This solution SHOULD cost you HUNDREDS of dollars every single month! We know that isn’t realistic, so we came up with a protocol that will cost you as little as just over ONE DOLLAR a day!</p>
<p><em><strong>WHAT IS IT?</strong></em><br />

<p><a href="https://sculptnation.com/greens-lp-v2"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-6661 size-large" src="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Screenshot-2020-01-09-14.05.02.png?resize=1024%2C763&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="763" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Screenshot-2020-01-09-14.05.02.png?resize=1024%2C763&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Screenshot-2020-01-09-14.05.02.png?resize=300%2C223&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Screenshot-2020-01-09-14.05.02.png?resize=768%2C572&amp;ssl=1 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><em><strong>DO NOT DELAY!</strong></em> If you are already experiencing any of the symptoms we mentioned above, you are most likely already suffering from cellular burnout.

<p>‘Tis the season … that many people freak out about all the calories they are about to consume.</p>
<p>Understandably so! Temptations are everywhere this time of year!</p>
<ul>
<li>Your workplace probably has a new cookie delivery every day in December.</li>
<li>Your calendar is likely full of parties where high-calorie adult beverages and appetizers will be freely passed around.</li>
<li>You have at least one family feast to attend, if not several, all in one or two days.</li>
<li>You may be traveling with limited access to everything you (think) you need to stay on track with training.</li>
</ul>
<p>BUT .. you have a choice in how you approach the holidays.</p>
<p>You can CHOOSE to relax and enjoy yourself.<br />
<strong>OR</strong><br />
You can CHOOSE to be scared, stressed, and anxiety-filled.</p>
<p>All the things that make “dieting” hard, to begin with, will only be multiplied this month.<br />
But with a little planning and the right attitude, the holiday season is NOTHING to worry about.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong>8 Easy Tips For a Guilt-Free Holiday</strong></h3>
<p><strong>DO NOT STARVE YOURSELF&#8230;</strong><br />
If you go to a party or sit down at the holiday dinner table extremely hungry, you will no doubt overeat. Be mindful of what you eat leading into your holiday feast, but don’t go in starving. Unless you already incorporate dieting techniques such as Intermittent Fasting, if you are hungry before your feast, we do not suggest you skip meals.</p>
<p>Fill up on lean proteins and veggies, or enjoy a delicious <a href="https://sculptnation.com/product/protein/">Sculpt Nation protein shake using our top of the line Whey Protein Isolate!</a></p>
<p><a href="https://sculptnation.com/product/protein/"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-6613 size-large" src="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/PROTEIN-BLOG-FINAL.gif?resize=576%2C1024&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="576" height="1024" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/PROTEIN-BLOG-FINAL.gif?resize=576%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 576w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/PROTEIN-BLOG-FINAL.gif?resize=169%2C300&amp;ssl=1 169w" sizes="(max-width: 576px) 100vw, 576px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><strong>CHOOSE WISELY…</strong><br />
Just because it’s available does not mean you have to eat it. You should prioritize your favorite foods and only eat what you enjoy.</p>
<p>If you don’t love cranberry sauce, why eat it?<br />
If you have been craving your grandma’s stuffing all year, eat more of that!<br />
If you aren’t a big drinker, pass on the egg nog and have yourself a bigger slice of pie!<br />
Pile up on protein, but maybe go light on the gravy.</p>
<p>Also, remember that your eyes tend to be bigger than your stomach. Sometimes simply seeing or smelling all that delicious food will increase your appetite. <a href="https://sculptnation.com/product/burn-fat-burner/">Sculpt Nation BURN</a> would be a great product to implement. BURN is a cutting edge fat burner that contains a powerful appetite suppressant that can help hold back the desire to overfill your plate.</p>
<p><a href="https://sculptnation.com/product/burn-fat-burner/"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-6612 size-large" src="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/BURN-GIF-FINAL.gif?resize=576%2C1024&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="576" height="1024" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/BURN-GIF-FINAL.gif?resize=576%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 576w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/BURN-GIF-FINAL.gif?resize=169%2C300&amp;ssl=1 169w" sizes="(max-width: 576px) 100vw, 576px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><strong>BE MINDFUL…</strong><br />
When it’s time to dig in, start with smaller portions, and then eat slowly. If you think you want to go back for seconds <em>(or thirds)</em>, give yourself a break before filling your plate again.</p>
<p>Your hands are a great measuring tool if you want to ensure you don’t go overboard.</p>
<p><strong>Your clenched fist is about a cup…</strong> This measure is useful for side dishes.</p>
<p><strong>The palm of your hand is about 3 ounces of cooked meat…</strong> Use this as a guide for all that turkey and ham.</p>
<p><strong>Your thumb = about 1 tablespoon….</strong> This measure comes in handy when you’re trying to estimate things like dressings and gravy.</p>
<p><strong>MODIFY…</strong><br />
We are NOT suggesting that you ask your wife, mom, or grandma to change their family recipe. But there is nothing wrong with modifying the dish that you contribute.<br />
There are endless ways to make all your holiday favorites into lower-calorie options, especially for breakfast! Why not serve up some <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/pumpkin-spice-protein/">Sculpt Nation Protein Pancakes</a> instead of a high-calorie Christmas morning feast. With a little creativity, modifications are endless!</p>
<p><strong>JUST MOVE…</strong><br />
You may not be able to get in your usual lifts and cardio, but that doesn’t mean you can’t get in a good workout. At the very least, you can always go for a brisk walk or jog.</p>
<p>If time allows, our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCOFCwvhDoUvYcfpD7RJKQwA">YouTube Channel</a> has endless home workouts that take no equipment and only minutes of your day!</p>
<p>One thing we DO NOT want you to do is use verbiage like “earning” your dinner. Food is not some sort of reward and exercise should not be seen as punishment. Treat your holiday workout just like you would any other day of the year. Do it because you are ABLE and because it’s part of your lifestyle.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAK UP&#8230;</strong><br />
Do not be shy when it comes to telling people about your healthy lifestyle. Tell everyone about why it is important to you! It will hopefully keep them from guilting you into overeating or making comments about your choices. You never know, you may even motivate them to do the same. To help them get started and point them in the right direction. you can always encourage them to take our <a href="https://vshred.com/sp/survey/survey-aka1/">FREE body type quiz!</a></p>
<p><strong>STAY OFF THE SCALE…</strong><br />
While one meal, or even a few, will not wreck your progress, it most likely will have temporary effects on your weight. If you eat lots of food, all of that volume will be sitting in your stomach until it fully digests. The weight gain you see is not FAT GAIN. Most of what you see on the scale will be fluid retention. Not to mention other factors that can cause the scale to go up. Things like stress, lack of sleep, and even travel.</p>
<p>Holidays aside, remember that even on a typical day, weight can fluctuate several pounds. The holidays are no different. Take a scale break. Before you weigh yourself post-holiday, give your body at least 3-5 days to normalize.</p>
<p><strong>ENJOY EVERY BITE&#8230;</strong><br />
Worrying about weight gain is way more unhealthy than any temporary pounds you may (but most likely will not) pack on.</p>
<p>We aren’t saying that it is okay to “overindulge” just because it’s a holiday.<br />
We are saying that a few days of enjoying yourself WILL NOT derail your progress.</p>
<p>Stressing out over the holidays isn’t going to do anything except make you less likely to enjoy your time with friends and family. In fact, all that anxiety can backfire and be the reason you overeat. Having a preoccupation with food often causes people to go to ‘extremes’ and do things like binge-eat. Stress also raises your cortisol levels, which can lead to scale fluctuations and even excess fat storage.</p>
<p>If you have a problem controlling your anxiety, you may want to grab some <a href="https://sculptnation.com/product/neuroctane/">Sculpt Nation NEUROCTANE</a>. This product features adaptogens that naturally reduce stress and raise dopamine and serotonin levels. You will naturally feel more relaxed in those stress and anxiety-filled situations.</p>
<p>We know the holidays are an expensive time of year, so we teamed up with Sculpt Nation to bring you a <strong>major discount </strong>on the supplements that melt fat, build lean muscle, and revitalize your health.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Don’t let the holiday cash-crunch bring you down. Get all Sculpt Nation supplements (including the ones I mentioned earlier ) <a href="https://sculptnation.com/shop/">40% off when you use code: MERRY40 at checkout! Click Here</a>.</p>

<p><strong>REMEMBER&#8230;</strong> the holidays are about more than food. Shift your focus to making memories that don’t involve eating. Do not be so focused on food and weight gain that you miss out on what is important this Holiday season. You can’t redo life once it’s passed you by!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>From our V SHRED family to yours, we wish you a HAPPY (and stress-free) HOLIDAY.</strong></p>

<p>Are You Ready? It’s Black Friday and it’s about to get crazy.</p>
<p>It’s the biggest shopping day of the year and you need to be prepared. From finding the perfect deals, planning your timing, waiting in long lines and lasting the full day&#8230;every part of the process needs to be tactically planned.</p>
<p>This “holiday” draws hordes of people out for a full day of shopping. If you’re a Black Friday shopper, try these tips to help you have a healthy shopping experience.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Prepare Your Body!</strong></h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Eat a Healthy Breakfast. </strong>This will help you stay energized throughout the day and keep you from binging on easily accessible fast food. <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/skinny-protein-pumpkin-muffins-recipe-for-thanksgiving/">If you need a quick and healthy breakfast recipe check out this low carb protein pumpkin recipe.</a> It doubles as a quick but filling breakfast and you can take some with you to snack on throughout the day.</li>
<li><strong>Wear Comfortable Clothing.<br />
</strong>You&#8217;ll be battling crowds and possibly stampedes of other shoppers fighting to get their sale items so comfortable and appropriate clothing is a must. Wear closed-toed comfortable shoes since you will be doing a lot of walking and to avoid your toes getting stepped on in the crowded stores.If you&#8217;re carrying a purse consider using a cross-body bag instead, you will avoid pickpocketers and be able to hang onto your personal belongings better.</li>
<li><strong>Get The Energy Boost You&#8217;ll Need.</strong><br />
On Black Friday you might feel exhausted. Thanksgiving can be tiring and chances are you were up early to start shopping. One dose of <a href="https://sculptnation.com/product/burn-fat-burner/"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Sculpt Nations BURN</strong></span></a> will give your body the boost it needs to help you burn off those extra Thanksgiving dinner calories and give you sustainable energy throughout the day.<strong><a href="https://sculptnation.com/product/burn-fat-burner/"> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Snag yourself a bottle for a whopping 50%</span> off</a> when you use coupon code: GAINS50 at checkout</strong> <em>(no fighting the crowds here)</p>
<p></em></li>
<li><strong>Hydrate.<br />
</strong>Drink plenty of water while shopping. It&#8217;s easy to get caught up in the Black Friday madness and dehydrate yourself by forgetting to drink water. Make sure you are giving yourself the proper fuel to run your body and keep hydrated.</li>
<li><strong>Pre-Pack Snacks.</strong><br />
There&#8217;s no doubt about it. You WILL be waiting in long lines today. Including lines at the food court. Having healthy snacks on hand will help you maintain your stamina, save you time, and money as well as prevent you from opting for unhealthier food options.</li>
<li><strong>Rest Up And Get A Good Night&#8217;s Sleep</strong>.<br />
After a long day of battling the crowds for those big savings, you will be physically and mentally exhausted. Help your body restore itself by getting the best sleep possible. <a href="https://sculptnation.com/product/burn-pm/"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Sculpt Nation’s BURN PM</strong></span></a> thermogenic formula includes powerful natural sleep enhancers to help you enjoy a deep sleep as well as helping your body to burn excess fat around the clock.<strong><a href="https://sculptnation.com/product/burn-pm/"> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Recover from your intense day of shopping and grab yourself a bottle of BURN PM 50% off</span></a> when you use coupon code: GAINS50 at checkout!</strong></li>
