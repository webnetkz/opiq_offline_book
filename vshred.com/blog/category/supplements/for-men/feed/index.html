That is a scary number!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Good thing you found this article because </span><b><i>we aren’t going to let YOU be “most” people! </i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lower temps do not have to equal larger waistlines! You just have to have a plan! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this short read we will &#8230;</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Explain why winter weight gain happens. Knowing why is important if you want to prevent it and the reason is probably not what you think. In fact, it is partially not even your fault!</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tell you why fall/winter is actually the BEST time to start a diet and training plan.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Give you 7 easy pro tips that will help guide you through the next few months. </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You may believe winter weight gain happens because of the holidays. Those extra home cooked meals and holiday parties are certainly a factor. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But </span><b><i>there is a DAILY issue you need to be prepared to fight </i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">if you want to avoid packing on winter pounds.</span></p>
<p><b>WHY YOU REALLY PACK ON POUNDS AFTER LABOR DAY</b></p>
<p><img class="size-large wp-image-7471" src="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_130930953.jpeg?resize=1024%2C512&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="512" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_130930953.jpeg?resize=1024%2C512&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_130930953.jpeg?resize=300%2C150&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_130930953.jpeg?resize=768%2C384&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_130930953.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_130930953.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the spring and summer months, you are given what we call a</span><b> fitness freebie. </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You get a </span><b><i>seasonal motivation boost</i></b> <span style="font-weight: 400;">that doesn’t happen when temperatures start to drop, and you begin to pull out the chunky sweaters and comfy leggings. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not only is the sun shining (which makes you happier because of Vitamin D), you are wearing LESS clothing in the summer months. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I don’t know about you, but knowing I’m going to be exposing more skin makes walking in the gym a little easier. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Covering up in layers, no doubt leads to the temptation to slack on body goals! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Knowing your arms, legs, and abs will be less exposed can easily be an excuse to slack. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, being layered up often means you don’t SEE the extra pounds, so they are easier to ignore.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But there is more to it than being bundled up….</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-7477" src="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_236518834.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_236518834.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_236518834.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_236518834.jpeg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_236518834.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_236518834.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span>The #1 reason you slack on health and fitness goals in colder months ISN’T EVEN YOUR FAULT!!</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, you have a part to play in all of this, but</span><b><i> there is actually a scientific reason why you have less desire to train and eat healthy when the sunshine of summer fades.</i></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We will explain why a little further down. But ya know what really stinks? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The scientific reason why we all experience these motivation slumps in the winter only adds to an even bigger issue with motivation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span>It doesn’t matter what season it is motivation ALWAYS comes and goes!</p>
<p>Spring, Summer, Fall, or Winter &#8211; you can NEVER rely on it!</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, what can you do when lack of sunshine and warm temps leave you even more tempted to hit snooze and reach for comfort foods? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You certainly don’t throw your hands up in the air and wait until January to make a resolution to crash diet to get your body ready for spring. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Believe it or not, RIGHT NOW is actually the IDEAL time to get started! </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you </span><b><i>START NOW, </i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">you will develop discipline and a routine heading into the holidays. This will put you in a great place mentally and physically to relax and “indulge” a little more at all those holiday gatherings! </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><b><i>Look at it this way ..<br />
</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Would you rather head into the holiday season already making progress toward your goals and be in a great spot <em>(where it would be okay even if you did gain an extra pound or two?)</em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Or would you rather put it off and only add more fat on top of what you want to lose?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The answer is clear— the solution to getting the motivation needed to make it happen, not so much.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But don’t worry! We’ve got ya covered</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (no pun intended)</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with a few easy motivation hacks!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><b>7 TIPS TO STAY MOTIVATED AS SEASONS CHANGE</b></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><b><br />
</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the number one questions we always get is … “<em>I am just not motivated. How can I motivate myself to train and eat better?”</em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As we mentioned earlier, it doesn&#8217;t matter what season it is, </span><b><i>you can’t always rely on motivation. </i></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you have it, great! You should certainly take advantage of it! But you have to know that it is totally normal to not have much of it. Even professional athletes lack motivation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You have to develop other daily habits that create discipline if you want to succeed long term!</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are a few of our pro tips that we use with our clients, specifically when temperatures drop, and motivation seems to be at its lowest! </span></p>
<p><b>TIP #1: Switch To An At Home Training Program</b></p>
<p><img class="size-large wp-image-7448" src="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_185038762.jpeg?resize=1024%2C647&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="647" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_185038762.jpeg?resize=1024%2C647&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_185038762.jpeg?resize=300%2C189&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_185038762.jpeg?resize=768%2C485&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_185038762.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_185038762.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you know that getting out of bed and stepping into the winter elements is going to be an excuse trigger, make a plan to train at home during cooler months! Some of the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">most effective and challenging workouts </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">only require your body weight and </span><b><i>maybe</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a set of dumbbells or some resistance bands.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A good fat-blasting, muscle-building sweat session can 100% be achieved from the comfort of your home!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adjustable dumbbells, ankle weights, resistance bands, a jump rope, etc., are all things that are inexpensive and can easily be stored in a closet or under your bed and pulled out anytime you don’t feel like leaving the house.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But if you have </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">the right training program</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><b><i>you don’t need any of that. </i></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our favorite </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">at-home bodyweight-only program</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is called</span><b> MOVE. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was designed to help you achieve your fitness goals without a single piece of equipment, and each workout is under 20 minutes! </span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Learn more about MOVE by watching the video below!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you need </span><b>a little extra “nudge”</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to get up and get moving, another </span><b>pro-tip we use</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is keeping some </span><a href="https://sculptnation.com/products/pre-workout" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><b>PRE WORKOUT </b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">on your bedside table. Have it already blended up and chug it as soon as your alarm goes off!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By the time you have brushed your teeth and put on your workout clothes, you will have a nice little jolt of energy and</span><b><i> tons of motivation</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to get going before you have a chance to come up with an excuse! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the bottom of this article, we will tell you about a big end of summer sale happening so that you can stock up on our </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">favorite </span><a href="https://sculptnation.com/products/pre-workout" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><b>PRE WORKOUT</b></a><strong> for 40% off when you use code: LABORDAY40 at checkout! </strong></p>
<p><b>TIP #2: Make Your Workouts Seasonal</b></p>
<p><img class="size-large wp-image-7452" src="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_65703942.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_65703942.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_65703942.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_65703942.jpeg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_65703942.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_65703942.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Embrace the change of seasons and take advantage of activities that you can only do in fall or winter! </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Go on a fall hike and view all the gorgeous foliage.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Try rock climbing.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Walk around a corn maze or pumpkin patch with your family. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you live in a snowy climate, go skiing, sledding, build snowmen with your kids, etc.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Go ice skating.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lace-up your sneakers, go for a walk or run at night, and admire all the Christmas lights and decorations.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are some things you can only do and see during specific times of the year. So instead of missing sunshine and water sports, focus on all the positive things that only come about with cooler temps!</span></p>
<p><b>TIP #3: Try Something Totally New</b></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-7454" src="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_361152601.jpeg?resize=1024%2C514&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="514" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_361152601.jpeg?resize=1024%2C514&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_361152601.jpeg?resize=300%2C151&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_361152601.jpeg?resize=768%2C386&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_361152601.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_361152601.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sometimes a change of routine is all you need to boost motivation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you have been doing all your gym lifts alone, recruit a gym buddy! Try switching up your cardio by skipping your solo runs and joining a group fitness class instead. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another option is to </span><b><i>allow yourself to slow down!</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> If you have been crushing it all spring and summer with intense training and hardcore workouts, </span><b><i>it may actually be time to take it down a notch. </i></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Going full force 365 can cause your stress hormone cortisol to increase. This can lead to a host of drawbacks, including weight gain, muscle loss, poor moods, fatigue, and occasional issues sleeping! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We aren’t saying you should become lazy! But if you have been crushing it 24/7 all spring and summer, your body (and mind) may need to slow down.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Use the next few months to embrace a slower routine. </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Commit to daily yoga.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Focus on becoming more flexible.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Switch to low or moderate-intensity cardio, instead of HIIT.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Try out some bodyweight workouts instead of heavy lifting.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Giving your body a couple of months to recover might even make you more responsive when you decide to kick things up again come spring/summer!</span></p>
<p><b>TIP #4: Stay Accountable</b></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-7457" src="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_266584820.jpeg?resize=1024%2C768&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="768" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_266584820.jpeg?resize=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_266584820.jpeg?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_266584820.jpeg?resize=768%2C576&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_266584820.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_266584820.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><b><br />
</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">The best way to stick to a plan is to have someone that you report back to. This could be a friend, family member, a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">social media community</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, or even a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">coach. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Including someone else, or even just telling someone else about your health and fitness goals and asking them to check in with you to make sure you are sticking to the plan, is a great way to keep the promises you make to yourself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you prefer to fly solo, it helps to create visuals. Make a vision board, create a daily checklist you can mark off after each workout, or keep an accomplishment journal.</span></p>
<p><b>TIP #5: Set A Spring Goal</b></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-7458" src="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_47332240.jpeg?resize=1024%2C680&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="680" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_47332240.jpeg?resize=1024%2C680&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_47332240.jpeg?resize=300%2C199&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_47332240.jpeg?resize=768%2C510&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_47332240.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_47332240.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">March may seem like a long time away, but it will be back before you know it, and 6 months is a long time to make significant changes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Setting a goal is a great way to encourage yourself to push past discomforts and temptation, but there is a science to goal setting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The key to creating goals that stick .. </span><b><i>be REALISTIC and SPECIFIC!</i></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s start with </span><b><i>reality. </i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">You should always focus on one goal at a time and make sure you are being honest with yourself if that goal is really attainable.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you know that your schedule will never allow you to work out 6 days a week, why would you choose a program that requires you to do that?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you know it’s not healthy to attempt to lose 10 pounds a week, why would you aim that high?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you love carbs, why would you go on a KETO diet? </span></p>
<p><b><i>Doing these things will essentially set yourself up for failure.</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Set attainable goals that fit YOUR lifestyle. You can always bump things up if your schedule allows, or you notice you aren’t pushing yourself hard enough. Just keep in mind that being realistic isn’t the same as not believing in yourself or making excuses. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moving on to being </span><b><i>specific.</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The more specific you are about your goals, the more likely you will be to reach them. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It may seem like it’s good enough to say things like .. I want to look good, lose weight, or get ripped! </span><b><i>But you have to dig deeper than that!! </i></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wanting to “lose weight,” for example, is an excellent place to start. But ask yourself what that means to you?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you expand on that and say &#8212; “I want to lose 10 pounds of fat. I will do this by not eating any sweets and doing the V Shred </span><a href="https://vshred.com/sp/move/soc-all/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><b>MOVE </b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">program for 30 consecutive days. I am doing this because I want to have better self-esteem and a head start on bikini season.” &#8212; that makes your goal more specific.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The more specific (and attainable) your goals are, the more likely you will be to not give up!</span></p>
<p><b>TIP #6: Reward Yourself</b></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-7459" src="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/vin_sant_32048508_366936073798151_433609263865135104_n.jpg?resize=882%2C1024&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="882" height="1024" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/vin_sant_32048508_366936073798151_433609263865135104_n.jpg?resize=882%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 882w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/vin_sant_32048508_366936073798151_433609263865135104_n.jpg?resize=258%2C300&amp;ssl=1 258w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/vin_sant_32048508_366936073798151_433609263865135104_n.jpg?resize=768%2C892&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/vin_sant_32048508_366936073798151_433609263865135104_n.jpg?w=1080&amp;ssl=1 1080w" sizes="(max-width: 882px) 100vw, 882px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you have checked a “mini goal” off your list, treat yourself. Knowing that you have a reward coming to celebrate your efforts will make you want to achieve it even more. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It may be tempting to make your reward one of your favorite “forbidden foods” but we never suggest that you reward yourself this way.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You aren’t a dog. You should never reward “good behavior” with food. Having this mentality can create a really unhealthy relationship with food.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You need to eat healthy MOST of the time, control your portions, and see food as fuel. But if you are craving something that isn’t quite as healthy as your grilled chicken and rice, never feel like you need to lose 20 pounds to “deserve” a bite of cake, or nice dinner out with your family. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instead of rewarding yourself with food, buy yourself something you have been wanting. Maybe some new workout clothes, a massage, or an extra $20 bucks in your vacation fund! </span></p>

<p><b>TIP #7: Make Mental Health Top Priority</b></p>
<p><img class="size-large wp-image-7460" src="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_255894146.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_255894146.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_255894146.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_255894146.jpeg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_255894146.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_255894146.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Earlier, we mentioned that cold weather motivation dips may not be your fault.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’m sure you have heard of winter blues. Well, it’s a real thing. Less natural light can cause dips in serotonin, the neurotransmitter that regulates mood.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The dark and dreary days of winter can also cause your body to produce more of the sleep hormone melatonin. This shift can disrupt your body and impact your sleep patterns and overall mood.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are a few ways that you can focus on improving your mental health.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Invest in a light therapy box that simulates natural daylight.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Make sure you are supplementing with or eating plenty of foods with Vitamin D.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Start journaling. There is a lot of scientific evidence that supports putting your thoughts on paper provides a long list of benefits, including stress management, self-confidence, and goal setting. </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Suppose you still find yourself struggling with negative seasonal motivation shifts. In that case, you may need to experiment with taking</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> naturally sourced herbs</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to help support brain health and a positive mood.</span></p>
<p><b><i>Here are a few with some great scientific backing to help boost mood.</i></b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>EnXtra: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">A natural caffeine-free patent-pending botanical ingredient that has been shown to help increase dopamine levels.**It is also one of the first and only natural caffeine-free patent-pending botanical ingredients shown to boost mental alertness &amp; acuity for hours or ending in a huge caffeine energy crash.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Piper Nigrum Fruit Extract:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> A very specific type of black pepper that has been shown to help increase both serotonin and dopamine.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>L-Theanine:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> A powerful amino acid that is believed to help reduce occasional anxiety brought on by stressful situations.</span></li>
</ul>

<p><b><i>BOTTOM LINE IF YOU WANT TO STAY MOTIVATED YEAR ROUND</i></b><b><i><br />
</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you put away the shorts and swimsuits and shift out of bikini season, it’s common for motivation to “fall back” with the clocks. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The seasons have to change (unless you live near the equator) &#8211; so you have to figure out ways to</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">not let your fitness goals go into hibernation mode!</span><b><i> </i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pumpkin spice lattes are only here for a limited time, but getting into shape isn’t seasonal! </span><i>It&#8217;s a year-round commitment!!</i><i> </i></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>The Testosterone Suppression Response: What it is and how it’s holding you back</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>Close your eyes and imagine&#8230;</strong></em><br />
Having enough energy to power through your day with ease … laser focus and clarity to crush everyday tasks &#8230; seeing optimal results from weight training … ridding yourself of stubborn fat … having a robust sex life … being able to lay your head on your pillow and getting a quality, restful night of sleep.</p>
<p><em><strong>Sounds pretty dang good, doesn’t it?</strong> </em><br />
There are hundreds of chemical substances in your body that work in silence to ensure that all of this (plus more) can happen.</p>
<p><em><strong>We are talking about .. your hormones!</strong></em><br />
Hormones are messengers that tell your organs what they need to do and when.</p>
<p>Your hormones regulate everything… from how you think, feel, sleep, build muscle, store fat, breathe, and expend energy… to how hungry you are, your body temperature, sexual reproduction, libido, and much more.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>It doesn’t matter if you are 20 or 70 .. male or female ..</strong></em><br />
<em><strong>hormone levels can become “imbalanced” at any time &#8211; for many reasons.</strong></em></p>

<p>Even young and healthy individuals can experience hormone disruptions. This can come about from poor diet and lifestyle choices, and believe it or not, too much of a GOOD thing can also cause your hormones to go crazy! Excess exercise and diet can even be culprits!</p>
<p>Because your hormones quietly go to work&#8230;<em><strong> it’s not until something seems off that you would notice they aren’t functioning at top capacity.</strong></em></p>
<p>In this article, we want to discuss two hormones in particular and the shocking and potentially hazardous relationship they have with each other.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>NEW HORMONE RESEARCH SHOCKED US</strong><br />
Scientists have discovered a HIDDEN REASON why one of your KEY HORMONES could be low. And why even if you try to replenish it… your attempts could fail!</p>
<p>It’s something we had never heard before and are pretty sure you haven’t either.</p>
<p>Before we tell you about this strange connection and what you can do to help tackle root cause … we want to emphasize why <em><strong>this is something you should address immediately!</strong></em></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>THE IMPORTANCE OF OPTIMAL HORMONE LEVELS</strong><br />
Knowing that your hormones are messengers for pretty much every bodily function, you can understand how having balanced hormones is important if you want to look and feel your best.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, hormone imbalance is a widespread issue, and, more times than not, it goes unnoticed.</p>
<p>Most people don’t realize something is “off” until hormone levels have been changing for a while. By this time, they are already causing a number of unexplained issues.</p>
<ul>
<li>Difficulty losing weight</li>
<li>Excess storage of fat</li>
<li>Changes in appetite</li>
<li>GI Issues</li>
<li>Trouble with restful sleep</li>
<li>Exhaustion</li>
<li>Muscle weakness/loss</li>
<li>Occasional shifts in mood</li>
<li>Low sex drive</li>
</ul>
<p><em><strong>These effects can creep up slowly…</strong></em> making it difficult to even realize your body is changing. They are also often brushed aside as a “natural” result of a stress, aging, or the outcome of yet another failed diet.</p>
<p>We all require different hormone levels. But each of us&#8230; no matter weight, height, gender, sex, or race .. should ensure our hormone levels are in a normal, healthy range.</p>
<p>It takes only a small fluctuation to cause big changes.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>WHAT ARE THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF HORMONES</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Your body has two main operating systems… the nervous system and the endocrine system.</p>
<p>The endocrine system is responsible for secreting hormones into the bloodstream via numerous glands.</p>
<p>There are said to be more than 200 hormones or hormone-like substances in the body.</p>
<p><em><strong>Here is a breakdown of some of your MAIN hormones&#8230;</strong></em></p>
<ul>
<li>Thyroid Hormones (T3/T4)</li>
<li>Growth hormone</li>
<li>Leptin</li>
<li>Ghrelin</li>
<li>Insulin</li>
<li>Adrenaline</li>
<li>Serotonin</li>
<li>Estrogen</li>
<li>Progesterone</li>
<li>Cortisol</li>
<li>Testosterone</li>
</ul>
<p>As stated above, for this article, we are only focusing on two.</p>
<p>We are looking into testosterone and cortisol. The relationship researchers have discovered they have with each other&#8230; <em><strong>totally changes the way we look at “boosting” testosterone.</strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>WHAT IS TESTOSTERONE</strong></em></p>

<p style="text-align: left;">If you are reading this, you need optimal testosterone levels. Testosterone is one of the main hormones responsible for your overall health.</p>
<p>Yes, it is primarily KNOWN as a male sex hormone that is made in the testes&#8230; but women produce and need testosterone.</p>
<p>Testosterone is typically associated with sex drive. It also plays a vital role in the development of muscle mass, bone density, the way you store body fat, and mood.</p>
<p><em><strong>Everyone needs testosterone and no one is safe from declining testosterone levels!</strong></em></p>
<p>There are tons of TESTOSTERONE MYTHS… here are a few we want to bust!!</p>
<p><em><strong>Testosterone is NOT only for men&#8230;</strong></em><br />
Men may make and need more, but ladies, you need this sex hormone too!</p>
<p><em><strong>Age does NOT dictate how much testosterone you have….</strong></em><br />
Just because you are YOUNG does not mean you aren’t at risk for having lower test levels!<br />
Yes, your testosterone levels naturally can decline starting in your 30’s, but this is not the only cause of lower testosterone levels.</p>
<p><em><strong>It’s NOT just some “supplement” meatheads take…</strong></em><br />
Do SOME people abuse testosterone and take a “man-made” version (thinking it will lead to greater muscle gains) &#8211; yes!</p>
<p>Man-made testosterone (an anabolic steroid) is NOT what we are referring to. Your body makes testosterone naturally, and you need optimal levels for optimal health.</p>
<p><em><strong>It’s NOT as simple as “boosting” testosterone levels…</strong> </em><br />
If low testosterone is an issue, people believe that all they need to do is BOOST the testosterone they aren’t creating. So they shell out money products that promise to boost testosterone production.</p>
<p>Sounds like the logical solution, right?</p>
<p><em><strong>NOT SO FAST</strong></em> …. these products can help you support the creation of more testosterone, but that is only HALF of the solution.</p>
<p>We stumbled upon some pretty shocking research that could explain why just <em><strong>replenishing your testosterone levels isn’t enough.</strong></em></p>
<p>There is actually a hidden factor as to why your testosterone may be low, and why modulating testosterone alone may NOT be enough.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>Do you want to promote more energy, better libido, less body fat, and more lean muscle?</strong></em><br />
<em><strong>Then you need to know about this new discovery!</strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>THE HIDDEN REASON YOUR TESTOSTERONE IS LOW</strong><a href="https://sculptnation.com/testboost" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-7235 size-full" src="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_221827769.jpeg?resize=1170%2C635&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1170" height="635" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_221827769.jpeg?w=6000&amp;ssl=1 6000w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_221827769.jpeg?resize=300%2C163&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_221827769.jpeg?resize=768%2C417&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_221827769.jpeg?resize=1024%2C556&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_221827769.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_221827769.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1170px) 100vw, 1170px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">One real reason your testosterone levels have tanked could be because you are making TOO MUCH of another hormone!</p>
<p>Harvard University conducted a groundbreaking study and had a major discovery.</p>
<p>When CORTISOL levels are too high, testosterone levels drop, and any testosterone support you try to give your body may become LESS effective.</p>
<p>If their theory is correct, then <em><strong>it may not be a lack of testosterone that is the issue</strong></em>. Instead, it could be an increase in cortisol that is STOPPING your body’s ability to make and use testosterone.</p>
<p>This means that it won’t matter how much you boost new testosterone you through supplements… <em><strong>If your cortisol is high, all the fresh testosterone in the world won’t matter, because too much of the stress hormone (cortisol) can inhibit testosterone production!!</strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>WHAT IS CORTISOL</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://sculptnation.com/testboost"><img class="size-full wp-image-7238" src="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_243475643.jpeg?resize=1170%2C780&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1170" height="780" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_243475643.jpeg?w=4500&amp;ssl=1 4500w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_243475643.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_243475643.jpeg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_243475643.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_243475643.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_243475643.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1170px) 100vw, 1170px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Cortisol is your body&#8217;s main stress hormone, but it does way more than manage stress response.</p>
<p>It is a “multi-tasking” hormone, meaning it controls many bodily functions…</p>
<ul>
<li>Fuels your body’s “fight-or-flight” instinct</li>
<li>Boosts energy levels</li>
<li>Regulates mood</li>
<li>Controls sleep/wake cycles</li>

<p>If you are mentally stressed out, have an “a-type” personality, do not get enough sleep, are calorie restricted for an extended time, or are training too hard &#8211; <em><strong>there is a good chance your cortisol could be out of range.</strong></em></p>
<p>Your body NEEDS healthy levels of cortisol, but too much can lead to a host of issues.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>THE IMPORTANT RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN CORTISOL AND TESTOSTERONE</strong></p>

<p style="text-align: left;">That study that Harvard researchers did shows us there is an important relationship between cortisol and testosterone.</p>
<p>They work against each other &#8211; and unless you get your stress levels down &#8211; cortisol is the winner.</p>
<p>Too much cortisol can cause something called <em><strong>Testosterone Suppression Response (TSR.)</strong></em></p>
<p>Basically, this means that no matter how much testosterone you’re making, if you have too much cortisol, you will struggle with TSR and continue to have the consequences of low testosterone, even if you have plenty!</p>
<p>Effects like…<br />
Loss of muscle mass .. low sex drive .. inability to lose fat .. poor sleep quality .. etc.</p>
<p>As a result, even if you use testosterone boosters, it may not matter if your cortisol is elevated.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>HOW TO CURB THE TESTOSTERONE SUPPRESSION RESPONSE (TSR)</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Your most important line of defense is lowering your cortisol levels.</p>
<p>We put together a <a href="https://sculptnation.com/testboost">2-minute at home test</a> you can take to help determine if you have too much cortisol. We will tell you where you can go to take that in just a moment.</p>
<p>First, we want to give you a couple of methods to lower cortisol and fight TSR….</p>
<p><strong>Manage Stress Levels (mental and physical)</strong><br />
The most effective way to lower your cortisol levels is to get your stress under control. Stress is not just mental .. it can be any physical stress you are placing on your body as well.</p>
<p><strong>Focus on quality sleep</strong><br />
You need 7-9 hours of quality sleep every single night (minimum) to keep your cortisol levels in check. This can be virtually impossible if your cortisol is high because cortisol regulates your sleep/wake cycle.</p>
<p><strong>These changes are challenging to adhere to!</strong> Avoiding cortisol spiking stressors is pretty much IMPOSSIBLE! We face stress every day. Even dieting and exercising can cause your body to be “stressed out.” And how can you get quality sleep if your sleep/wake cycle is messed up!?</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>Thankfully… THERE IS ONE OTHER WAY TO HELP FIGHT BACK!!!</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>Focus on diet &amp; supplementing with cortisol lowering/test boosting support supplements…</strong></em> There are some nutrients you can take daily that help support a reduction in cortisol levels, as well as a few foods you should try to TOTALLY AVOID.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://sculptnation.com/testboost" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>CLICK HERE to discover&#8230;</strong></em></a><br />
<em><strong>AN EASY and SCIENTIFICALLY backed way to give your body the </strong></em><br />
<em><strong>cortisol crushing nutrients it needs&#8230;</strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>The 4 foods you need to avoid…</strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>A 2-minute quiz to help you determine if your cortisol is high ..</strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>++ More on that groundbreaking testosterone/cortisol study&#8230;</strong></em></p>
<p>Researchers also found that the effects cortisol have on testosterone are reversed when stress levels go down.</p>
<p>This is GOOD NEWS! Now that we know that high cortisol blocking your testosterone IS an issue… we can fight back!!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>In this video, we explain everything you need to know about TSR and </strong></em><br />
<em><strong>an effective approach to knocking it out! </strong></em><br />

<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>THE LONGER YOU WAIT &#8211; THE WORSE THINGS WILL GET</strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Your body will continue to struggle as this testosterone suppression response continues, and it will only get worse if you don&#8217;t take charge and destroy your ability to make and use testosterone.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>Boosting your testosterone is great, but it’s a complete waste of time</strong></em><br />
<em><strong>if you aren’t blocking cortisol too.</strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>We have discovered <a href="https://sculptnation.com/testboost" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">THE ONLY testosterone maximizing method</a> available that is specifically designed to support healthy testosterone while minimizing and balancing the effects of cortisol.</strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://sculptnation.com/testboost" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>CLICK HERE TO FIND OUT FOR YOURSELF</strong></em></a></p>
<p><em><strong>REMEMBER… You need OPTIMAL TESTOSTERONE LEVELS if you want support to…</strong></em></p>

<p>We know, we know! Talking about the birds and the bees is uncomfortable&#8230; But we can’t hold out on giving you this information! READ THIS AND GET YOUR SEX DRIVE BACK!!</p>
<p><em>I have a headache.</em><br />
<em>I am too exhausted.</em><br />
<em>I feel “fat” today.</em><br />
<em>I had a terrible day.</em><br />
<em>I have to take care of the kids.</em><br />
<em>I am too sore from my V Shred workout.</em></p>
<p>We have all had a reason to turn down some bump n’ grind.. getting frisky.. knocking boots.. doing a little mattress dancing. Okay, okay, we’ll stop. We’re blushing too!</p>
<p><strong>But what if (most of the time) the reason you aren’t in the mood has nothing to do with any of that?</strong></p>
<p>What if you are just as frustrated about your lack of desire as your partner is?</p>
<p><strong>You WANT to be intimate with your partner but can’t figure out WHY you no longer have the URGE?</strong></p>
<p>There isn’t a “universal norm” when it comes to sex drive.</p>
<p>Everyone’s sexual appetite is different and not feeling that “spark” can be influenced by numerous things, some of which are relational and emotional.</p>
<p>But many people find themselves in a different situation. Their libido is low and they can’t seem to get in the mood … <strong>but they have no idea why?!</strong></p>
<p>If this is you… <strong>There may be A SIMPLE REASON and ALL-NATURAL APPROACH</strong><br />
<strong>that will help reboot your sexual health!</strong></p>
<p>There is a hormone your body needs to feel frisky.</p>
<p>It’s called <em>Testosterone</em>.</p>
<p>Testosterone belongs to a class of male hormones (called androgens). You have to have optimal testosterone levels to not only have a roaring libido but to be able to lose fat, grow muscle, and function normally!</p>

<p><strong>WHAT CAUSES TESTOSTERONE TO BECOME LOW?</strong></p>
<p>Testosterone levels can take a nose-dive for MANY reasons…</p>
<ul>
<li>OBESITY</li>
<li>HORMONAL DISORDERS</li>
<li>TYPE 2 DIABETES</li>
<li>CERTAIN DISEASE/CHRONIC ILLNESS</li>
<li>CERTAIN MEDICATIONS</li>
<li>STRESS</li>
<li>POOR DIET (including over dieting)</li>
<li>ALCOHOL ABUSE</li>
<li>AGE (After 30, testosterone levels decrease every year naturally)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>WHAT CAN YOU DO ABOUT IT?</strong><br />
To find out if your testosterone levels are in a healthy range, you would need to see a doctor and get bloodwork done.</p>
<p>If you are having any significant signs associated with low testosterone levels, we suggest you make a doctor&#8217;s appointment and get checked out!</p>
<p>But for many of us, our testosterone levels simply aren’t OPTIMAL.</p>
<p>Here at V Shred and Sculpt Nation, we spent a lot of time researching what it can do to the body when testosterone isn’t in an optimal range.</p>
<p>Once we did our homework and discovered there could be a <strong>NATURAL APPROACH</strong>, we sought out to find THE MOST HIGH-QUALITY form of these very specific science-backed herbs and adaptogens. Then we nailed down the proper combinations and dosages that would make these natural ingredients the most effective!</p>
<p><strong>The result?</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://sculptnation.com/products/test-boost?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=post&amp;utm_campaign=v-shred&amp;utm_content=Vday-Blog-M-TestBoost&amp;utm_term=77907521"><strong>TEST BOOST</strong></a> &#8211; A scientifically supported powerful blend that can not only be beneficial for boosting libido, sexual performance, sex drive, and sexual satisfaction .. but also enhance muscle growth and athletic performance.</p>
<p><strong>That’s right, lower testosterone levels may also be the reason why you are busting your butt in the gym and following your meal plan, but NOT seeing results.</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://sculptnation.com/products/test-boost?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=post&amp;utm_campaign=v-shred&amp;utm_content=Vday-Blog-M-TestBoost&amp;utm_term=77907521"><strong>TEST BOOST by Sculpt Nation</strong></a> contains eight different research-backed ingredients that provide a safe, natural, and effective way to refresh your libido and boost your body’s own testosterone levels.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>LISTEN ….</strong><br />
Don’t you want to give your significant other (and yourself) the gift of&#8230; a robust sex life!?</p>
<p>Heck, forget about ONE day! What about the other 364?!</p>
<p>New research just came out that says that the percentage of American adults not having sex has reached a record high.</p>
<p><strong>Here is a look at just some of the <em>sextistics</em> out there….</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The portion of Americans age 18 to 29 reporting having <span style="text-decoration: underline;">no sex</span> more than doubled between 2008 and 2018, to 23 percent.</li>
<li>13 percent of married couples in the United States report having sex only a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">few times per year.</span></li>
<li>Only 26% of couples have sex <span style="text-decoration: underline;">once a week.</span> The majority do the deed only <span style="text-decoration: underline;">1-2x a month.</span></li>
<li>And get this .. 15 to 20 percent of couples are in a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">TOTALLY sexless relationship.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><em>TALK ABOUT SOME TRAGIC NUMBERS!</em> Low sex drive can affect all ages, all genders, and all relationships.</p>
<p>Not to mention, if you aren’t having enough sex, it could hurt way more than your ego.</p>
<p><strong>A healthy sex life…..</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Boosts Immunity</li>
<li>Helps Maintain Healthy Blood Pressure</li>
<li>Improves Sleep</li>
<li>Enhances Cognition</li>
<li>Eases Anxiety &amp; Stress</li>
<li>Boosts Self Esteem</li>
<li>Makes You More Affectionate</li>
<li>Burns Calories</li>
</ul>
<p>No doubt it has endless benefits.</p>
<p>But in order to want it, you most likely need to have optimal testosterone levels! Having lower testosterone can have many other effects on your brain and body!</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Make sure your supplements have these test-boost ingredients if you want to maximize muscle gains and improve athletic performance.</p>
<h2>7 Test-Boost Ingredients Your Supplement Should Have</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>1. Tribulus Terrestris</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-5704 size-full" src="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Seeds-of-Tribulus-terrestris-plant-test-boost-ss.jpg?resize=625%2C400&#038;ssl=1" alt="Tribulus Terrestris | Must-Haves In Your Testosterone Supplement" width="625" height="400" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Seeds-of-Tribulus-terrestris-plant-test-boost-ss.jpg?w=625&amp;ssl=1 625w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Seeds-of-Tribulus-terrestris-plant-test-boost-ss.jpg?resize=300%2C192&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>The tribulus terrestris is a Mediterranean plant people use for its array of health and aesthetic benefits. Users take it for sports, bodybuilding, and even disease prevention, among others.</p>
<p>Researchers once tested the effects of tribulus terrestris on a group of professional rugby players. The results showed that it helped the athletes increase strength, build larger muscles, and trim down body fat.</p>
<p>It’s the best testosterone booster to help you <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/best-way-to-burn-fat-and-build-muscle-reset-your-hormones-naturally/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">increase strength gains and get over plateaus</a>. That way, you can increase your size without sacrificing lean muscle mass.</p>
<h3>2. American Panax Ginseng</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-5705 size-full" src="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Ginseng-root-on-wooden-background-test-boost-ss.jpg?resize=625%2C400&#038;ssl=1" alt="American Panax Ginseng | Must-Haves In Your Testosterone Supplement" width="625" height="400" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Ginseng-root-on-wooden-background-test-boost-ss.jpg?w=625&amp;ssl=1 625w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Ginseng-root-on-wooden-background-test-boost-ss.jpg?resize=300%2C192&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>The American panax ginseng stimulates hormone-producing glands to create more testosterone. Not only does this natural testosterone supplement help with bodybuilding, but it also alleviates testosterone-deficiency complications such as erectile dysfunction (ED).</p>
<p>It may be the best <a href="https://sculptnation.com/product/test-boost/">testosterone supplement</a> to increase both your muscle mass and libido at the same time. In fact, recent studies show that panax ginseng helps enhance erections by boosting the production of sex hormones.</p>
<h3>3. Cordyceps Mushroom</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-5706 size-full" src="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/dried-cordyceps-militaris-mushroom-on-wooden-spoon-test-boost-ss.jpg?resize=625%2C400&#038;ssl=1" alt="Cordyceps Mushroom | Must-Haves In Your Testosterone Supplement" width="625" height="400" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/dried-cordyceps-militaris-mushroom-on-wooden-spoon-test-boost-ss.jpg?w=625&amp;ssl=1 625w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/dried-cordyceps-militaris-mushroom-on-wooden-spoon-test-boost-ss.jpg?resize=300%2C192&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>Gym-goers struggling with endurance can start taking cordyceps mushroom. It’s a natural testosterone booster that mainly improves the body’s ability to withstand prolonged vigorous physical activity.</p>
<p>Cordyceps mushrooms can help you go harder and stronger at the gym. That way, you can pump out more high-quality sets and reps every time you work out.</p>
<h3>4. Ashwaganda Root 4:1 Extract</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-5708 size-full" src="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Roots-and-powder-of-Ashwagandha-also-known-as-Indian-ginseng-test-boost-ss.jpg?resize=625%2C400&#038;ssl=1" alt="Ashwaganda Root 4:1 Extract | Must-Haves In Your Testosterone Supplement" width="625" height="400" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Roots-and-powder-of-Ashwagandha-also-known-as-Indian-ginseng-test-boost-ss.jpg?w=625&amp;ssl=1 625w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Roots-and-powder-of-Ashwagandha-also-known-as-Indian-ginseng-test-boost-ss.jpg?resize=300%2C192&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>Taking the best <a href="https://sculptnation.com/product/test-boost/">testosterone supplements</a> is useless if you’re constantly under a lot of stress. You may not know it, but stress actually decreases the amount of testosterone in your body.</p>
<p>When you’re under stress, the body produces cortisol, a testosterone-sapping hormone. Luckily, Ashwaganda root is a testosterone booster that decreases the amount of cortisol the body has.</p>
<p>As a result, users can enjoy an increase in both strength and muscle mass. In fact, one study showed that Ashwaganda roots helped their subjects lift heavier on the bench press while adding mass in the triceps, biceps, and forearms.</p>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> To decrease cortisol levels, remember to take a breather every now and then. Stress negatively affects the way our mind and body performs.</p>
<h3>5. Hawthorn Berry Extract (Crategus Leavigata)</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-5709 size-full" src="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Medical-folk-remedies-from-the-fruits-of-hawthorn-test-boost-ss.jpg?resize=625%2C400&#038;ssl=1" alt="Hawthorn Berry Extract (Crategus Leavigata) | Must-Haves In Your Testosterone Supplement" width="625" height="400" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Medical-folk-remedies-from-the-fruits-of-hawthorn-test-boost-ss.jpg?w=625&amp;ssl=1 625w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Medical-folk-remedies-from-the-fruits-of-hawthorn-test-boost-ss.jpg?resize=300%2C192&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>You can use hawthorn berry extract to increase blood flow to your muscles. It may be the best supplement for testosterone-deficient men who don’t drive enough blood and oxygen to their muscles.</p>
<p>Athletes can use this top <a href="https://sculptnation.com/product/test-boost/">testosterone supplement</a> to feed their muscles with oxygen and blood. This leads to faster muscle recovery so you can get back to the gym stronger than ever.</p>
<p>Also, men struggling with ED can use this to pump more blood into their penis.</p>
<h3>6. LongJack (Euryooma Longifolla) Root</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-5710 size-full" src="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Eurycoma-Longifolia-Jack-is-the-herb-name-for-what-is-more-commonly-known-as-Tongkat-Ali-test-boost-ss.jpg?resize=625%2C400&#038;ssl=1" alt="LongJack (Euryooma Longifolla) Root | Must-Haves In Your Testosterone Supplement" width="625" height="400" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Eurycoma-Longifolia-Jack-is-the-herb-name-for-what-is-more-commonly-known-as-Tongkat-Ali-test-boost-ss.jpg?w=625&amp;ssl=1 625w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Eurycoma-Longifolia-Jack-is-the-herb-name-for-what-is-more-commonly-known-as-Tongkat-Ali-test-boost-ss.jpg?resize=300%2C192&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>LongJack root is a popular herb in Southeast Asia. Since ancient times, Malaysian men have been using this root to improve their sexual prowess.</p>
<p>Today, many athletes claim that the longjack root is the best natural testosterone booster to improve strength and hormone levels. It’s a natural ingredient fitness buffs all around the world look for in the <a href="https://sculptnation.com/product/test-boost/">testosterone booster supplements</a> they use.</p>
<h3>7. Epimedium (Epimedium Grandiflorum)</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-5711 size-full" src="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/red-flowering-epimedium-barrenwort-test-boost-ss.jpg?resize=625%2C400&#038;ssl=1" alt="Epimedium (Epimedium Grandiflorum) | Must-Haves In Your Testosterone Supplement" width="625" height="400" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/red-flowering-epimedium-barrenwort-test-boost-ss.jpg?w=625&amp;ssl=1 625w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/red-flowering-epimedium-barrenwort-test-boost-ss.jpg?resize=300%2C192&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>Due to its potent libido-enhancing prowess, users call this supplement the horny goat weed.</p>
<p>This power-packed herb enhances sexual performance by promoting healthy blood flow to the genitals. It does this by blocking PDE5, a chemical that restricts the distribution of blood to the penis.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, athletes can use this herb to improve testosterone levels and decrease the amount of cortisol in the body. Doing so may lead to better athletic performance and <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/how-to-gain-muscle-mass/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">bigger muscle mass</a>.</p>

<p>The body needs testosterone to increase lean muscle mass, cut body fat, improve libido, and hasten muscle recovery. There are dozens of supplements out there, but unless they have these test-boost ingredients, taking them won’t mean anything.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The drive to obtain the perfect body can tempt you into taking shortcuts without thinking of possible side effects of steroids. People lose sight of the harm they’re causing themselves by clinging to the idea of being in control.</p>
<p>The side effects of steroids can cause lasting damage that leaves you incapacitated and at risk for an early death. It’s possible to <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/how-to-gain-muscle-mass/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">gain a healthy form</a> without resorting to dangerous supplements.</p>

<h3><strong>What Are Anabolic Steroids?</strong></h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2172" src="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/anabolic-steroid-pills-syringe-capsule-tablet-side-effects-of-steroids-ss.jpg?resize=625%2C419&#038;ssl=1" alt="What Are Anabolic Steroids? | Negative Side Effects Of Steroids | Healthy Alternatives To Make Gains" width="625" height="419" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/anabolic-steroid-pills-syringe-capsule-tablet-side-effects-of-steroids-ss.jpg?w=625&amp;ssl=1 625w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/anabolic-steroid-pills-syringe-capsule-tablet-side-effects-of-steroids-ss.jpg?resize=300%2C201&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>Synthetic anabolic steroids imitate characteristics of the male sex hormone testosterone. Doctors have occasionally resorted to them to treat men with issues related to low testosterone.</p>
<p>It also increases the stamina to help build muscles. That&#8217;s why steroids look tempting for athletes. As a result, steroids are often referenced when athletes get permanently banned from a sport after getting caught with illegal substances.</p>
<p>You take the steroids by injecting or taking them in orally. Then, your body breaks them down and passes them into your cells.</p>
<p>They later bind to structures called androgen receptors, designed to work with the body’s natural testosterone. The anabolic steroids fool these receptors into thinking it’s testosterone, causing them to activate and increase the protein levels in your body.</p>
<p>This process rapidly creates new cells in your body, leading to an increase in muscle mass. It also speeds up muscle recovery after a workout, allowing you to work out for longer periods of time.</p>
<div id="How" class="anchor"></div>
<h3><strong>How Are They Used?</strong></h3>
<p>Anabolic steroids administered by a doctor can help cancer patients recover and treat people lacking certain hormones. Other valid medical uses for anabolic steroids include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Treating anemia</li>
<li>Helping breast cancer patients</li>
<li>Alleviating endometriosis</li>
<li>Aiding AIDS patients in gaining weight</li>
</ul>
<p>Carefully monitored doses can minimize any potential harm. But using these drugs without a doctor’s direction puts you at risk for lasting physical damage.</p>
<p>Since it’s hard to get access to these drugs without a physician’s approval, many get them from unverified sources through illegal means. You could buy versions of these drugs as supplements from health food stores up until 2004 when they were permanently banned.</p>
<p>However, people still obtain illegal versions of anabolic steroids at places like their local gym or hunt them down through other sources like backroom laboratories or unethical pharmacies.</p>
<div id="Damage" class="anchor"></div>
<h3><strong>What Damage Do Steroids Cause The Body?</strong></h3>
<p>Abuse of anabolic steroids causes side effects to appear within a very short amount of time. Some early signs of anabolic steroid abuse might include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your skin becomes oily and acne-ridden</li>
<li>Losing your hair</li>
<li>Showing increasing signs of aggression with little provocation</li>
<li>Increasing blood pressure</li>
</ul>
<div id="Effects" class="anchor"></div>
<h3><strong>What Are The Long-Term Effects Of Using Steroids?</strong></h3>
<p>More serious adverse effects from long-term use include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Development of heart issues</li>
<li>Elevated cholesterol levels</li>
<li>Damage to your kidney and liver</li>
<li>Shrinking of your testicles and related infertility</li>
</ul>
<p>Many side effects of steroids can be reversed once you stop taking the drugs. But that gets harder the longer you go on using them without proper supervision.</p>
<p>In effect, you can get physically and psychologically dependent on the steroids. This leads to risky behavior trying to continue obtaining more of the drug.</p>
<p>More than the side effects of steroids on your health, it also drains your financial resources. It’s not recommended for heavy users to try and stop using on their own. This could lead to a worsening of mood swings and even put you in a suicidal state.</p>
<p>You can receive help withdrawing from the steroids by placing yourself under a doctor’s care. They can recommend treatments designed to safely get the drugs out of your system.</p>
<div id="Natural" class="anchor"></div>
<h3><strong>How Can You Make Natural Gains Without Steroids?</strong></h3>

<p>What they will do is allow you to maintain a healthy lifestyle and physique in a way that doesn’t slowly break down your overall biology.</p>
<h3>1. Maintain a Nutritious Diet</h3>
<p>Yes, we’re starting here, because people tend to find every way they can to get around this. But the single best thing you can do for yourself and your body is making sure you’re giving it healthy, nutritious food at regular intervals.</p>
<p>This isn’t intended to plug a specific diet or health regime. We recommend you get help from a certified dietician. They can help you come up with meal plans and snacks designed to help you meet your stated goals.</p>
<h3>2. Find a Clean Form of <a href="https://sculptnation.com/product/creatine/">Creatine</a></h3>
<p>Creatine, an amino acid, forms naturally in the body and helps it regulate certain functions. Many bodybuilders take it in food form to increase their stamina.</p>
<p>It also helps build muscle mass by creating more muscle cells and making them larger. It’s important to take creatine the right way to start seeing real gains.</p>
<p>Improper or overuse can lead to side effects like stomach pains and issues with bowel movements. Talk to a fitness professional if you have questions about the proper dose for your current weight and height.</p>
<p>They’ll help you find a product that’s been verified as free of anything harmful.</p>
<h3>3. Use <a href="https://sculptnation.com/product/protein-chocolate/">Protein Powders</a></h3>
<p>Some people find it difficult to get enough protein from their normal diet to help them build the muscle mass they desire. Protein powders can fill that gap and help your body produce more of the enzymes and other substances needed to help your muscles recover properly.</p>
<h3>4. Try <a href="https://sculptnation.com/product/bcaas/">L-carnitine</a></h3>
<p>L-carnitine is another form of amino acid that improves your endurance during intense workouts. You can find versions in most health food or drug stores.</p>
<p>It keeps blood sugar low and aids in burning fat. This also helps make the definition from muscle gains more obvious.</p>
<p>Other benefits of L-carnitine include improving blood flow and making you feel less sore after workouts. As with anything you take in your body, make sure you’re taking the recommended dosage and consult someone professionally qualified to answer your questions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Creatine is a great alternative to help you build muscles. With it, you won&#8217;t have to worry about any side effects of steroids. Watch the video below to find out more about this amino acid:</strong><br />

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of the toughest things men have to deal with as they age is the declining levels of testosterone. Just how important is testosterone? Testosterone is the male hormone responsible for muscle mass and fast metabolism. Read on to learn how to boost testosterone.</p>
<h2>How To Boost Your Body&#8217;s Testosterone Levels | Get It Up</h2>
<p>By the time men hit 30, testosterone levels start to decline. This puts them at greater risk to different conditions — from cardiovascular problems to type 2 diabetes and obesity.</p>
<p>Testosterone is important for women, as well. Testosterone levels among women also peak during their 20s.</p>
<p>Women have traces of the anabolic hormone, though it is only around 10% of what men usually have. Women who lose their body’s testosterone also experience the same problems such as weight gain and sluggish metabolism.</p>
<p>Fortunately, there are ways to boost your testosterone levels. Here are simple things you can implement to boost your body’s testosterone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span style="color: #000080;">1. Eat the Right Type of Dietary Fat</span></h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-1349 size-full" src="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/products-sports-nutrition-rich-proteins-carbohydrates-Boost-Testosterone-Levels-ss.jpg?resize=625%2C418&#038;ssl=1" alt="Eat the Right Type of Dietary Fat | Tips On How To Boost Testosterone Levels | supplements to increase testosterone" width="625" height="418" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/products-sports-nutrition-rich-proteins-carbohydrates-Boost-Testosterone-Levels-ss.jpg?w=625&amp;ssl=1 625w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/products-sports-nutrition-rich-proteins-carbohydrates-Boost-Testosterone-Levels-ss.jpg?resize=300%2C201&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>Dietary fat is considered by many as a bad thing. However, let’s agree that there are different types of fats you can consume.</p>
<p>Fats are needed by the body for metabolizing vitamins A, D, E and K. According to studies, fats can help boost the body’s testosterone level.</p>
<p>Consuming controlled levels of quality fats such as coconut oil, egg yolk, and olive oil can make a huge difference to how much testosterone your body produces.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #000080;">2. Choose the Right Type of Cholesterol</span></h3>
<p>Testosterone is basically made from cholesterol. Therefore, there’s a strong relationship between levels of testosterone to the amount of cholesterol you take.</p>
<p>But to stay healthy, you have to consider the type of cholesterol you are consuming. According to experts, HDL or high-density lipoprotein is the type of cholesterol you want to incorporate into your meals.</p>
<p>It is associated with the better cardiovascular condition and weight loss. What types of food usually contain HDL? Fish, vegetables, and fruits are among the most popular options for HDL-rich meals.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #000080;">3. Supplementation</span></h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-1350 size-full" src="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/steel-dumbbell-colorful-vitamins-pills-on-Boost-Testosterone-Levels-ss.jpg?resize=625%2C417&#038;ssl=1" alt="Supplementation | Tips On How To Boost Testosterone Levels | supplements to increase testosterone" width="625" height="417" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/steel-dumbbell-colorful-vitamins-pills-on-Boost-Testosterone-Levels-ss.jpg?w=625&amp;ssl=1 625w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/steel-dumbbell-colorful-vitamins-pills-on-Boost-Testosterone-Levels-ss.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>Supplementation is also important to increase your body’s testosterone level. Test boosters help your body produce more natural testosterone, leading to more lean muscle gains, faster fat loss, and can even help your libido. However not all Testosterone supplements are created equally. You&#8217;ll want one with potent ingredients that actually work.</p>
<p><strong>Ingredients to look for in a Testosterone Booster:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>TRIBULUS TERRESTRIS:</strong> One study performed with Tribulus and elite Rugby players showed that Tribulus “significantly increased strength and fat-free mass.</li>
<li><strong>AMERICAN PANAX GINSENG:</strong> Panax American Ginseng is a true testosterone &amp; libido-boosting all-star.</li>
<li><strong>CORDYCEPS MUSHROOM:</strong> This powerful, natural food has been shown in animal studies to significantly increase testosterone levels. Cordyceps has also been shown to increase endurance, which may help you in the gym… and in the bedroom.</li>
<li><strong><strong>ASHWAGANDHA ROOT 4:1 EXTRACT: </strong></strong>Ashwagandha can help reduce your body’s production of the testosterone-sapping stress hormone, Cortisol. Studies show that excess Cortisol can clamp down your testosterone levels. <span style="font-size: 1rem;">Studies show that Ashwagandha can also help significantly increase your testosterone levels. </span><span style="font-size: 1rem;"><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Ashwagandha may also help you rapidly gain strength. In one study, Ashwagandha Root helped lifters gain significant strength in the Bench Press while also packing on extra mass in the biceps, triceps, and forearms.</span></span></li>
<li><strong>HAWTHORN BERRY EXTRACT: </strong>Helps increase blood flow, and has been used to help support erectile health.</li>
<li><strong>LONGJACK ROOT:</strong> Helps boost strength and support free testosterone levels.</li>
<li><strong>EPIMEDIUM:</strong> Commonly known as Horny Goat Weed, this power-packed herb helps improve sexual performance by inhibiting the activity of PDE5, a chemical that blocks the dilation and blood flow to the genitals. Epimedium may also help bolster your testosterone levels, crush Cortisol, and improve your libido.</li>
</ul>

<h3><span style="color: #000080;">4. Be Smart in Your Training</span></h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-1352 size-full" src="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/young-woman-stretching-her-back-after-Boost-Testosterone-Levels-ss.jpg?resize=625%2C417&#038;ssl=1" alt="Be Smart in Your Training | Tips On How To Boost Testosterone Levels | supplements to increase testosterone" width="625" height="417" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/young-woman-stretching-her-back-after-Boost-Testosterone-Levels-ss.jpg?w=625&amp;ssl=1 625w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/young-woman-stretching-her-back-after-Boost-Testosterone-Levels-ss.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>If you <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/full-lower-body-6-pack-abs-workout-bodyweight-exercises-only/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">intend to workout</a>, try sticking to programs that have higher volumes, rather than low-rep-high intensity workouts.</p>
<p>There is enough evidence stating 70 to 80 percent of your 10-rep max repeatedly done could elicit the best testosterone response.</p>
<p>Also, focus on larger muscle groups of the body. Free weights have been proven to increase testosterone levels the most. If you are the type of person who loves to run for hours, you may want to stop this.</p>
<p>Longer hours of training could decrease the amount of testosterone in your body. As rule of thumb, stick to a 60-minute moderate to high-intensity workout instead.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #000080;">5. Get Enough Sleep</span></h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-1351 size-full" src="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/top-view-sexy-muscular-young-man-Boost-Testosterone-Levels-ss.jpg?resize=625%2C418&#038;ssl=1" alt="Get Enough Sleep | Tips On How To Boost Testosterone Levels | supplements to increase testosterone" width="625" height="418" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/top-view-sexy-muscular-young-man-Boost-Testosterone-Levels-ss.jpg?w=625&amp;ssl=1 625w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/top-view-sexy-muscular-young-man-Boost-Testosterone-Levels-ss.jpg?resize=300%2C201&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>Sleep is just as important as working out. Lack of sleep dramatically reduces your testosterone levels which then triggers body fat formation.</p>
<p>To get the most testosterone from sleeping, you should sleep for around 7 to 9 hours in a day.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Start training smarter by doing your push-ups correctly. Here&#8217;s a checklist you can follow</b><b>:</b></p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='1170' height='659' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/6QWwBcOsAfw?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></p>
<p>The amount of testosterone in the body will eventually drop as we get older. Low testosterone levels have been associated with sluggish metabolism, which triggers problems ranging from type 2 diabetes to heart conditions. The good news is you can still find ways to naturally increase the body’s testosterone levels to have a healthier body longer.</p>
