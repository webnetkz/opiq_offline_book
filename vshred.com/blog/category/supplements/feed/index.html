<p>When exercise becomes a convenient habit, transformations become possible. In August 2019, Deborah, 40, of Inez, TX came back to work after a week off due to nerve damage in her back. The other waitresses in the restaurant where she worked had started a small weight loss challenge. The winner amongst them would get the prize pool from each person’s $5 buy in plus a gift card for matching that total. It wasn’t much, but Deborah figured what the heck…and now her V Shred transformation is inspiring others!</p>
<p><em>“I put money in and signed up, but I was convinced I wouldn’t lose weight so I just kept doing what I normally did.”</em> she explained.</p>
<p>After a couple weeks, as some of the other waitresses started to lose a few initial pounds Deborah saw a photo of herself and did not like what was looking back at her.</p>
<p><em>“Man was it an eye opener.”</em></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-7636" src="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Deb-before-blog.png?resize=1024%2C1024&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="1024" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Deb-before-blog.png?resize=1024%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Deb-before-blog.png?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 150w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Deb-before-blog.png?resize=300%2C300&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Deb-before-blog.png?resize=768%2C768&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Deb-before-blog.png?resize=60%2C60&amp;ssl=1 60w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Deb-before-blog.png?w=1080&amp;ssl=1 1080w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>The very next day she signed up for a gym membership with a friend. As they both consistently went to the gym after dropping the kids off at school at eating healthier, she started to notice results.</p>
<p><em>“Within a month I lost 9 pounds! With the busy schedules of kids and work I didn’t want to be stressed about work outs and food.”</em></p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Finding Fat Loss Extreme for Women &#8211; Starting A V Shred Transformation</h2>
<p>It was a good start, but as a busy working mother of 3, Deborah knew she needed something more straightforward and structured.</p>
<p><em>“I needed someone to tell me what workouts to do on what days, how many reps, when to rest, and FOR SURE what to eat. Counting macros was not in the cards for me and didn’t have to be. With V Shred its all done for me and works. I love all of it!!”</em> she described, looking back on her V Shred transformation.</p>
<p>Deborah first got started with the <a href="https://vshred.com/sp/fat-loss-extreme-f/sku_CKcwR4TEg54IeG?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=socialmedia&amp;utm_campaign=female-motivation-testimonial&amp;utm_content=Product-Author&amp;utm_term=5">Fat Loss Extreme for Her</a> program. Once she completed the initial 90 days she switched to the <a href="https://vshred.com/sp/ripped-in-90-days/sku_AR6nTj3PTK3uu9?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=socialmedia&amp;utm_campaign=female-motivation-testimonial&amp;utm_content=Product-Author&amp;utm_term=5">Ripped In 90 Days</a> program, and now does a regular combination of the two.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-7629" src="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/before-after-f-sc-225.jpg?resize=1024%2C1024&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="1024" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/before-after-f-sc-225.jpg?resize=1024%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/before-after-f-sc-225.jpg?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 150w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/before-after-f-sc-225.jpg?resize=300%2C300&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/before-after-f-sc-225.jpg?resize=768%2C768&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/before-after-f-sc-225.jpg?resize=60%2C60&amp;ssl=1 60w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/before-after-f-sc-225.jpg?w=1080&amp;ssl=1 1080w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><em>“I was never involved in working out or eating healthy ever.”</em> Deborah explained. <em>“After starting V Shred my body was constantly changing for the better and I now see muscles I didn’t know I had! I keep going then pushing harder.”</em></p>
<p>Throughout 2020 Deborah was able to continue her exercises at the gym, despite COVID closures in other parts of Texas. Her success inspired her to close in a patio at home, and like many, create her own home gym.</p>
<p><em>“It has everything I need except a stair stepper and a couple of leg machines.”</em></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-7630" src="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/ezgif-2-f58715b67360.gif?resize=1080%2C410&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1080" height="410" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><em>“With the home gym and all of V Shred’s programs, I have plenty to do. I also purchased <a href="https://vshred.com/sp/move?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=socialmedia&amp;utm_campaign=female-motivation-testimonial&amp;utm_content=Product-Author&amp;utm_term=5">V Shred&#8217;s MOVE Program</a> during quarantine! As far as nutrition, I kept making my meal plans [with my V Shred Trainer] and sticking with the diet. We have a garden to grow our own vegetables, have 10 chickens for fresh eggs, and a pond stocked with catfish and perch which are just now getting big enough to eat.”</em></p>
<p>Once her weight loss results were noticeable from diet and exercise alone Deborah started implementing SculptNation supplements to gain that extra edge on her already active day to day life.</p>
<p><em>“When Sculpt Nation has their <a href="https://sculptnation.com/products/fat-loss-stack?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=socialmedia&amp;utm_campaign=female-motivation-testimonial&amp;utm_content=Product-Author&amp;utm_term=5">40% off sales</a> I stock up 3-6 months in advance… My closet is kind of like a supplement store.”</em> Deborah mused.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-7631" src="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/117831867_592673508072569_7785970253332491242_n.jpg?resize=1024%2C768&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="768" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/117831867_592673508072569_7785970253332491242_n.jpg?resize=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/117831867_592673508072569_7785970253332491242_n.jpg?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/117831867_592673508072569_7785970253332491242_n.jpg?resize=768%2C576&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/117831867_592673508072569_7785970253332491242_n.jpg?w=1242&amp;ssl=1 1242w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">A True V Shred Transformation &#8211; From Tired &amp; Injured to Proud &amp; Self-Sufficient</h2>
<p>From the support Deborah received from family and friends, she also had a bit of a wakeup call. Well past the initial challenge with coworkers, others were noticing her body composition change, her improved attitude, and her enthusiasm for helping others. As people started asking her questions, she knew helping others transform into happy and proud versions of themselves (like she had) was something she wanted to do.</p>
<p><em>“My mom saw my weight loss and started training with me. She got down 30 pounds in 3 months! My 4 year old wants to eat what I eat so he can have muscles. My 13 year old loves going to the gym with me. My husband constantly tells me how proud of me he is. They’ve all supported me 100%!”</em></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-7633" src="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Deb-progress2.png?resize=1024%2C1024&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="1024" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Deb-progress2.png?resize=1024%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Deb-progress2.png?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 150w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Deb-progress2.png?resize=300%2C300&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Deb-progress2.png?resize=768%2C768&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Deb-progress2.png?resize=60%2C60&amp;ssl=1 60w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>Now Deborah is returning the favor!</p>
<p><em>“Now that I have been on this journey I know that I absolutely want to help people to hit their personal goals and feel happy and proud of themselves inside and out.”</em></p>
<p>Deborah has enrolled in the ACE personal training certification program. At age 40 with new goals and dreams she’s working to become certified as a trainer, nutritionist, and youth fitness coach to help kids get on the right track early, as she now has been able to help her family do.</p>
<p>This fall Deborah competed in an online competition to be featured on <a href="https://mshealthandfitness.com/2020/deborah-mcdaniel?utm_source=vshred-blog&amp;utm_medium=socialmedia&amp;utm_campaign=female-motivation-testimonial&amp;utm_content=Product-Author&amp;utm_term=5">Ms Health And Fitness</a> and finished in the top 10!</p>
<h2>Giving Back Fitness Motivation</h2>
<p>When Deborah was asked about how community plays a part in a fitness journey and her personal V Shred transformation she mentioned her success was all about the support she received. Motivating loved ones, professional guidance, and a community of like minded individuals help make personal transformations possible.</p>
<p><em>“My experience with Vshred has been life changing. When it comes to my fitness journey I am proud that I stuck to it even when I didn’t want to. The Vshred for women Facebook page is amazing, all the support and transformation are awesome!”</em></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-7568" src="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/43707f0c562bc5957a2488cd1a9fd5322a9e2de0.jpg?resize=1024%2C768&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="768" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/43707f0c562bc5957a2488cd1a9fd5322a9e2de0.jpg?resize=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/43707f0c562bc5957a2488cd1a9fd5322a9e2de0.jpg?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/43707f0c562bc5957a2488cd1a9fd5322a9e2de0.jpg?resize=768%2C576&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/43707f0c562bc5957a2488cd1a9fd5322a9e2de0.jpg?w=1440&amp;ssl=1 1440w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><em>“I never even thought of going to the gym and eating healthy, but now want to help others do it. If V Shred wouldn’t have been such an amazing program I probably would have stopped a long time ago!”</em></p>
<p>The V Shred Team is so proud of Deborah’s journey and cannot wait to see her help others build active and healthy lifestyles. Her’s is a unique, and lifelong journey. Shred on!</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the spring and summer months, you are given what we call a</span><b> fitness freebie. </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You get a </span><b><i>seasonal motivation boost</i></b> <span style="font-weight: 400;">that doesn’t happen when temperatures start to drop, and you begin to pull out the chunky sweaters and comfy leggings. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not only is the sun shining (which makes you happier because of Vitamin D), you are wearing LESS clothing in the summer months. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I don’t know about you, but knowing I’m going to be exposing more skin makes walking in the gym a little easier. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Covering up in layers, no doubt leads to the temptation to slack on body goals! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Knowing your arms, legs, and abs will be less exposed can easily be an excuse to slack. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, being layered up often means you don’t SEE the extra pounds, so they are easier to ignore.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But there is more to it than being bundled up….</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-7477" src="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_236518834.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_236518834.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_236518834.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_236518834.jpeg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_236518834.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_236518834.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span>The #1 reason you slack on health and fitness goals in colder months ISN’T EVEN YOUR FAULT!!</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, you have a part to play in all of this, but</span><b><i> there is actually a scientific reason why you have less desire to train and eat healthy when the sunshine of summer fades.</i></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We will explain why a little further down. But ya know what really stinks? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The scientific reason why we all experience these motivation slumps in the winter only adds to an even bigger issue with motivation.</span></p>

<p>Spring, Summer, Fall, or Winter &#8211; you can NEVER rely on it!</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, what can you do when lack of sunshine and warm temps leave you even more tempted to hit snooze and reach for comfort foods? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You certainly don’t throw your hands up in the air and wait until January to make a resolution to crash diet to get your body ready for spring. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Believe it or not, RIGHT NOW is actually the IDEAL time to get started! </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you </span><b><i>START NOW, </i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">you will develop discipline and a routine heading into the holidays. This will put you in a great place mentally and physically to relax and “indulge” a little more at all those holiday gatherings! </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><b><i>Look at it this way ..<br />
</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Would you rather head into the holiday season already making progress toward your goals and be in a great spot <em>(where it would be okay even if you did gain an extra pound or two?)</em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Or would you rather put it off and only add more fat on top of what you want to lose?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The answer is clear— the solution to getting the motivation needed to make it happen, not so much.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But don’t worry! We’ve got ya covered</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (no pun intended)</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with a few easy motivation hacks!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><b>7 TIPS TO STAY MOTIVATED AS SEASONS CHANGE</b></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><b><br />
</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the number one questions we always get is … “<em>I am just not motivated. How can I motivate myself to train and eat better?”</em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As we mentioned earlier, it doesn&#8217;t matter what season it is, </span><b><i>you can’t always rely on motivation. </i></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you have it, great! You should certainly take advantage of it! But you have to know that it is totally normal to not have much of it. Even professional athletes lack motivation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You have to develop other daily habits that create discipline if you want to succeed long term!</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are a few of our pro tips that we use with our clients, specifically when temperatures drop, and motivation seems to be at its lowest! </span></p>
<p><b>TIP #1: Switch To An At Home Training Program</b></p>
<p><img class="size-large wp-image-7448" src="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_185038762.jpeg?resize=1024%2C647&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="647" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_185038762.jpeg?resize=1024%2C647&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_185038762.jpeg?resize=300%2C189&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_185038762.jpeg?resize=768%2C485&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_185038762.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_185038762.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you know that getting out of bed and stepping into the winter elements is going to be an excuse trigger, make a plan to train at home during cooler months! Some of the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">most effective and challenging workouts </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">only require your body weight and </span><b><i>maybe</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a set of dumbbells or some resistance bands.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A good fat-blasting, muscle-building sweat session can 100% be achieved from the comfort of your home!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adjustable dumbbells, ankle weights, resistance bands, a jump rope, etc., are all things that are inexpensive and can easily be stored in a closet or under your bed and pulled out anytime you don’t feel like leaving the house.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But if you have </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">the right training program</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><b><i>you don’t need any of that. </i></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our favorite </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">at-home bodyweight-only program</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is called</span><b> MOVE. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was designed to help you achieve your fitness goals without a single piece of equipment, and each workout is under 20 minutes! </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By the time you have brushed your teeth and put on your workout clothes, you will have a nice little jolt of energy and</span><b><i> tons of motivation</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to get going before you have a chance to come up with an excuse! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the bottom of this article, we will tell you about a big end of summer sale happening so that you can stock up on our </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">favorite </span><a href="https://sculptnation.com/products/pre-workout" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><b>PRE WORKOUT</b></a><strong> for 40% off when you use code: LABORDAY40 at checkout! </strong></p>
<p><b>TIP #2: Make Your Workouts Seasonal</b></p>
<p><img class="size-large wp-image-7452" src="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_65703942.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_65703942.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_65703942.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_65703942.jpeg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_65703942.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_65703942.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Embrace the change of seasons and take advantage of activities that you can only do in fall or winter! </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Go on a fall hike and view all the gorgeous foliage.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Try rock climbing.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Walk around a corn maze or pumpkin patch with your family. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you live in a snowy climate, go skiing, sledding, build snowmen with your kids, etc.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Go ice skating.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lace-up your sneakers, go for a walk or run at night, and admire all the Christmas lights and decorations.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are some things you can only do and see during specific times of the year. So instead of missing sunshine and water sports, focus on all the positive things that only come about with cooler temps!</span></p>
<p><b>TIP #3: Try Something Totally New</b></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-7454" src="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_361152601.jpeg?resize=1024%2C514&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="514" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_361152601.jpeg?resize=1024%2C514&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_361152601.jpeg?resize=300%2C151&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_361152601.jpeg?resize=768%2C386&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_361152601.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_361152601.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sometimes a change of routine is all you need to boost motivation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you have been doing all your gym lifts alone, recruit a gym buddy! Try switching up your cardio by skipping your solo runs and joining a group fitness class instead. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another option is to </span><b><i>allow yourself to slow down!</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> If you have been crushing it all spring and summer with intense training and hardcore workouts, </span><b><i>it may actually be time to take it down a notch. </i></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Going full force 365 can cause your stress hormone cortisol to increase. This can lead to a host of drawbacks, including weight gain, muscle loss, poor moods, fatigue, and occasional issues sleeping! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We aren’t saying you should become lazy! But if you have been crushing it 24/7 all spring and summer, your body (and mind) may need to slow down.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Use the next few months to embrace a slower routine. </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Commit to daily yoga.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Focus on becoming more flexible.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Switch to low or moderate-intensity cardio, instead of HIIT.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Try out some bodyweight workouts instead of heavy lifting.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Giving your body a couple of months to recover might even make you more responsive when you decide to kick things up again come spring/summer!</span></p>
<p><b>TIP #4: Stay Accountable</b></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-7457" src="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_266584820.jpeg?resize=1024%2C768&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="768" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_266584820.jpeg?resize=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_266584820.jpeg?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_266584820.jpeg?resize=768%2C576&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_266584820.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_266584820.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><b><br />
</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">The best way to stick to a plan is to have someone that you report back to. This could be a friend, family member, a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">social media community</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, or even a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">coach. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Including someone else, or even just telling someone else about your health and fitness goals and asking them to check in with you to make sure you are sticking to the plan, is a great way to keep the promises you make to yourself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you prefer to fly solo, it helps to create visuals. Make a vision board, create a daily checklist you can mark off after each workout, or keep an accomplishment journal.</span></p>
<p><b>TIP #5: Set A Spring Goal</b></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">March may seem like a long time away, but it will be back before you know it, and 6 months is a long time to make significant changes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Setting a goal is a great way to encourage yourself to push past discomforts and temptation, but there is a science to goal setting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The key to creating goals that stick .. </span><b><i>be REALISTIC and SPECIFIC!</i></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s start with </span><b><i>reality. </i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">You should always focus on one goal at a time and make sure you are being honest with yourself if that goal is really attainable.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you know that your schedule will never allow you to work out 6 days a week, why would you choose a program that requires you to do that?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you know it’s not healthy to attempt to lose 10 pounds a week, why would you aim that high?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you love carbs, why would you go on a KETO diet? </span></p>
<p><b><i>Doing these things will essentially set yourself up for failure.</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Set attainable goals that fit YOUR lifestyle. You can always bump things up if your schedule allows, or you notice you aren’t pushing yourself hard enough. Just keep in mind that being realistic isn’t the same as not believing in yourself or making excuses. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moving on to being </span><b><i>specific.</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The more specific you are about your goals, the more likely you will be to reach them. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It may seem like it’s good enough to say things like .. I want to look good, lose weight, or get ripped! </span><b><i>But you have to dig deeper than that!! </i></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wanting to “lose weight,” for example, is an excellent place to start. But ask yourself what that means to you?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you expand on that and say &#8212; “I want to lose 10 pounds of fat. I will do this by not eating any sweets and doing the V Shred </span><a href="https://vshred.com/sp/move/soc-all/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><b>MOVE </b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">program for 30 consecutive days. I am doing this because I want to have better self-esteem and a head start on bikini season.” &#8212; that makes your goal more specific.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The more specific (and attainable) your goals are, the more likely you will be to not give up!</span></p>
<p><b>TIP #6: Reward Yourself</b></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-7459" src="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/vin_sant_32048508_366936073798151_433609263865135104_n.jpg?resize=882%2C1024&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="882" height="1024" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/vin_sant_32048508_366936073798151_433609263865135104_n.jpg?resize=882%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 882w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/vin_sant_32048508_366936073798151_433609263865135104_n.jpg?resize=258%2C300&amp;ssl=1 258w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/vin_sant_32048508_366936073798151_433609263865135104_n.jpg?resize=768%2C892&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/vin_sant_32048508_366936073798151_433609263865135104_n.jpg?w=1080&amp;ssl=1 1080w" sizes="(max-width: 882px) 100vw, 882px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you have checked a “mini goal” off your list, treat yourself. Knowing that you have a reward coming to celebrate your efforts will make you want to achieve it even more. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It may be tempting to make your reward one of your favorite “forbidden foods” but we never suggest that you reward yourself this way.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You aren’t a dog. You should never reward “good behavior” with food. Having this mentality can create a really unhealthy relationship with food.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You need to eat healthy MOST of the time, control your portions, and see food as fuel. But if you are craving something that isn’t quite as healthy as your grilled chicken and rice, never feel like you need to lose 20 pounds to “deserve” a bite of cake, or nice dinner out with your family. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instead of rewarding yourself with food, buy yourself something you have been wanting. Maybe some new workout clothes, a massage, or an extra $20 bucks in your vacation fund! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you think you need some nutrition guidance or want to learn more about creating a healthy relationship with food, take our <a href="https://vshred.com/sp/survey/survey-aka1/">free body type quiz</a> and we&#8217;ll tell you exactly what type of diet will deliver results for your goals and specific body type. </span></p>
<p><b>TIP #7: Make Mental Health Top Priority</b></p>
<p><img class="size-large wp-image-7460" src="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_255894146.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_255894146.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_255894146.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_255894146.jpeg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_255894146.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_255894146.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Earlier, we mentioned that cold weather motivation dips may not be your fault.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’m sure you have heard of winter blues. Well, it’s a real thing. Less natural light can cause dips in serotonin, the neurotransmitter that regulates mood.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The dark and dreary days of winter can also cause your body to produce more of the sleep hormone melatonin. This shift can disrupt your body and impact your sleep patterns and overall mood.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are a few ways that you can focus on improving your mental health.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Invest in a light therapy box that simulates natural daylight.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Make sure you are supplementing with or eating plenty of foods with Vitamin D.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Start journaling. There is a lot of scientific evidence that supports putting your thoughts on paper provides a long list of benefits, including stress management, self-confidence, and goal setting. </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Suppose you still find yourself struggling with negative seasonal motivation shifts. In that case, you may need to experiment with taking</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> naturally sourced herbs</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to help support brain health and a positive mood.</span></p>
<p><b><i>Here are a few with some great scientific backing to help boost mood.</i></b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>EnXtra: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">A natural caffeine-free patent-pending botanical ingredient that has been shown to help increase dopamine levels.**It is also one of the first and only natural caffeine-free patent-pending botanical ingredients shown to boost mental alertness &amp; acuity for hours or ending in a huge caffeine energy crash.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Piper Nigrum Fruit Extract:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> A very specific type of black pepper that has been shown to help increase both serotonin and dopamine.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>L-Theanine:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> A powerful amino acid that is believed to help reduce occasional anxiety brought on by stressful situations.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can find all of these natural herbs (plus 3 more) in a one of a kind supplement called </span><b><a href="https://sculptnation.com/neuroctane/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NEUROCTANE</a>. </b></p>

<p><b><i>BOTTOM LINE IF YOU WANT TO STAY MOTIVATED YEAR ROUND</i></b><b><i><br />
</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you put away the shorts and swimsuits and shift out of bikini season, it’s common for motivation to “fall back” with the clocks. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The seasons have to change (unless you live near the equator) &#8211; so you have to figure out ways to</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">not let your fitness goals go into hibernation mode!</span><b><i> </i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pumpkin spice lattes are only here for a limited time, but getting into shape isn’t seasonal! </span><i>It&#8217;s a year-round commitment!!</i><i> </i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Combining Sculpt Nation supplements with V Shred&#8217;s diet and training programs is a great way to get a head start on keeping those winter pounds at bay this year. </span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>The Testosterone Suppression Response: What it is and how it’s holding you back</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>Close your eyes and imagine&#8230;</strong></em><br />
Having enough energy to power through your day with ease … laser focus and clarity to crush everyday tasks &#8230; seeing optimal results from weight training … ridding yourself of stubborn fat … having a robust sex life … being able to lay your head on your pillow and getting a quality, restful night of sleep.</p>
<p><em><strong>Sounds pretty dang good, doesn’t it?</strong> </em><br />
There are hundreds of chemical substances in your body that work in silence to ensure that all of this (plus more) can happen.</p>
<p><em><strong>We are talking about .. your hormones!</strong></em><br />
Hormones are messengers that tell your organs what they need to do and when.</p>
<p>Your hormones regulate everything… from how you think, feel, sleep, build muscle, store fat, breathe, and expend energy… to how hungry you are, your body temperature, sexual reproduction, libido, and much more.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>It doesn’t matter if you are 20 or 70 .. male or female ..</strong></em><br />
<em><strong>hormone levels can become “imbalanced” at any time &#8211; for many reasons.</strong></em></p>

<p>Even young and healthy individuals can experience hormone disruptions. This can come about from poor diet and lifestyle choices, and believe it or not, too much of a GOOD thing can also cause your hormones to go crazy! Excess exercise and diet can even be culprits!</p>
<p>Because your hormones quietly go to work&#8230;<em><strong> it’s not until something seems off that you would notice they aren’t functioning at top capacity.</strong></em></p>
<p>In this article, we want to discuss two hormones in particular and the shocking and potentially hazardous relationship they have with each other.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>NEW HORMONE RESEARCH SHOCKED US</strong><br />
Scientists have discovered a HIDDEN REASON why one of your KEY HORMONES could be low. And why even if you try to replenish it… your attempts could fail!</p>
<p>It’s something we had never heard before and are pretty sure you haven’t either.</p>
<p>Before we tell you about this strange connection and what you can do to help tackle root cause … we want to emphasize why <em><strong>this is something you should address immediately!</strong></em></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>THE IMPORTANCE OF OPTIMAL HORMONE LEVELS</strong><br />
Knowing that your hormones are messengers for pretty much every bodily function, you can understand how having balanced hormones is important if you want to look and feel your best.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, hormone imbalance is a widespread issue, and, more times than not, it goes unnoticed.</p>
<p>Most people don’t realize something is “off” until hormone levels have been changing for a while. By this time, they are already causing a number of unexplained issues.</p>
<ul>
<li>Difficulty losing weight</li>
<li>Excess storage of fat</li>
<li>Changes in appetite</li>
<li>GI Issues</li>
<li>Trouble with restful sleep</li>
<li>Exhaustion</li>
<li>Muscle weakness/loss</li>
<li>Occasional shifts in mood</li>
<li>Low sex drive</li>
</ul>
<p><em><strong>These effects can creep up slowly…</strong></em> making it difficult to even realize your body is changing. They are also often brushed aside as a “natural” result of a stress, aging, or the outcome of yet another failed diet.</p>
<p>We all require different hormone levels. But each of us&#8230; no matter weight, height, gender, sex, or race .. should ensure our hormone levels are in a normal, healthy range.</p>
<p>It takes only a small fluctuation to cause big changes.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>WHAT ARE THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF HORMONES</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Your body has two main operating systems… the nervous system and the endocrine system.</p>
<p>The endocrine system is responsible for secreting hormones into the bloodstream via numerous glands.</p>
<p>There are said to be more than 200 hormones or hormone-like substances in the body.</p>
<p><em><strong>Here is a breakdown of some of your MAIN hormones&#8230;</strong></em></p>
<ul>
<li>Thyroid Hormones (T3/T4)</li>
<li>Growth hormone</li>
<li>Leptin</li>
<li>Ghrelin</li>
<li>Insulin</li>
<li>Adrenaline</li>
<li>Serotonin</li>
<li>Estrogen</li>
<li>Progesterone</li>
<li>Cortisol</li>
<li>Testosterone</li>
</ul>
<p>As stated above, for this article, we are only focusing on two.</p>
<p>We are looking into testosterone and cortisol. The relationship researchers have discovered they have with each other&#8230; <em><strong>totally changes the way we look at “boosting” testosterone.</strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>WHAT IS TESTOSTERONE</strong></em></p>

<p style="text-align: left;">If you are reading this, you need optimal testosterone levels. Testosterone is one of the main hormones responsible for your overall health.</p>
<p>Yes, it is primarily KNOWN as a male sex hormone that is made in the testes&#8230; but women produce and need testosterone.</p>
<p>Testosterone is typically associated with sex drive. It also plays a vital role in the development of muscle mass, bone density, the way you store body fat, and mood.</p>
<p><em><strong>Everyone needs testosterone and no one is safe from declining testosterone levels!</strong></em></p>
<p>There are tons of TESTOSTERONE MYTHS… here are a few we want to bust!!</p>
<p><em><strong>Testosterone is NOT only for men&#8230;</strong></em><br />
Men may make and need more, but ladies, you need this sex hormone too!</p>
<p><em><strong>Age does NOT dictate how much testosterone you have….</strong></em><br />
Just because you are YOUNG does not mean you aren’t at risk for having lower test levels!<br />
Yes, your testosterone levels naturally can decline starting in your 30’s, but this is not the only cause of lower testosterone levels.</p>
<p><em><strong>It’s NOT just some “supplement” meatheads take…</strong></em><br />
Do SOME people abuse testosterone and take a “man-made” version (thinking it will lead to greater muscle gains) &#8211; yes!</p>
<p>Man-made testosterone (an anabolic steroid) is NOT what we are referring to. Your body makes testosterone naturally, and you need optimal levels for optimal health.</p>
<p><em><strong>It’s NOT as simple as “boosting” testosterone levels…</strong> </em><br />
If low testosterone is an issue, people believe that all they need to do is BOOST the testosterone they aren’t creating. So they shell out money products that promise to boost testosterone production.</p>
<p>Sounds like the logical solution, right?</p>
<p><em><strong>NOT SO FAST</strong></em> …. these products can help you support the creation of more testosterone, but that is only HALF of the solution.</p>
<p>We stumbled upon some pretty shocking research that could explain why just <em><strong>replenishing your testosterone levels isn’t enough.</strong></em></p>
<p>There is actually a hidden factor as to why your testosterone may be low, and why modulating testosterone alone may NOT be enough.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>Do you want to promote more energy, better libido, less body fat, and more lean muscle?</strong></em><br />
<em><strong>Then you need to know about this new discovery!</strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>THE HIDDEN REASON YOUR TESTOSTERONE IS LOW</strong><a href="https://sculptnation.com/testboost" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-7235 size-full" src="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_221827769.jpeg?resize=1170%2C635&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1170" height="635" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_221827769.jpeg?w=6000&amp;ssl=1 6000w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_221827769.jpeg?resize=300%2C163&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_221827769.jpeg?resize=768%2C417&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_221827769.jpeg?resize=1024%2C556&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_221827769.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_221827769.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1170px) 100vw, 1170px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">One real reason your testosterone levels have tanked could be because you are making TOO MUCH of another hormone!</p>
<p>Harvard University conducted a groundbreaking study and had a major discovery.</p>
<p>When CORTISOL levels are too high, testosterone levels drop, and any testosterone support you try to give your body may become LESS effective.</p>
<p>If their theory is correct, then <em><strong>it may not be a lack of testosterone that is the issue</strong></em>. Instead, it could be an increase in cortisol that is STOPPING your body’s ability to make and use testosterone.</p>
<p>This means that it won’t matter how much you boost new testosterone you through supplements… <em><strong>If your cortisol is high, all the fresh testosterone in the world won’t matter, because too much of the stress hormone (cortisol) can inhibit testosterone production!!</strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>WHAT IS CORTISOL</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://sculptnation.com/testboost"><img class="size-full wp-image-7238" src="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_243475643.jpeg?resize=1170%2C780&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1170" height="780" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_243475643.jpeg?w=4500&amp;ssl=1 4500w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_243475643.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_243475643.jpeg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_243475643.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_243475643.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_243475643.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1170px) 100vw, 1170px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Cortisol is your body&#8217;s main stress hormone, but it does way more than manage stress response.</p>
<p>It is a “multi-tasking” hormone, meaning it controls many bodily functions…</p>
<ul>
<li>Fuels your body’s “fight-or-flight” instinct</li>
<li>Boosts energy levels</li>
<li>Regulates mood</li>
<li>Controls sleep/wake cycles</li>
<li>Helps control blood sugar levels</li>
<li>Manages how your body uses carbs/fats/protein</li>
<li>Regulates metabolism</li>
<li>Helps reduce inflammation</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are mentally stressed out, have an “a-type” personality, do not get enough sleep, are calorie restricted for an extended time, or are training too hard &#8211; <em><strong>there is a good chance your cortisol could be out of range.</strong></em></p>
<p>Your body NEEDS healthy levels of cortisol, but too much can lead to a host of issues.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>THE IMPORTANT RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN CORTISOL AND TESTOSTERONE</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://sculptnation.com/testboost"><img class="size-full wp-image-7236" src="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_319140527.jpeg?resize=1170%2C658&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1170" height="658" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_319140527.jpeg?w=7680&amp;ssl=1 7680w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_319140527.jpeg?resize=300%2C169&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_319140527.jpeg?resize=768%2C432&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_319140527.jpeg?resize=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_319140527.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_319140527.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1170px) 100vw, 1170px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">That study that Harvard researchers did shows us there is an important relationship between cortisol and testosterone.</p>
<p>They work against each other &#8211; and unless you get your stress levels down &#8211; cortisol is the winner.</p>
<p>Too much cortisol can cause something called <em><strong>Testosterone Suppression Response (TSR.)</strong></em></p>
<p>Basically, this means that no matter how much testosterone you’re making, if you have too much cortisol, you will struggle with TSR and continue to have the consequences of low testosterone, even if you have plenty!</p>
<p>Effects like…<br />
Loss of muscle mass .. low sex drive .. inability to lose fat .. poor sleep quality .. etc.</p>
<p>As a result, even if you use testosterone boosters, it may not matter if your cortisol is elevated.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>HOW TO CURB THE TESTOSTERONE SUPPRESSION RESPONSE (TSR)</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Your most important line of defense is lowering your cortisol levels.</p>
<p>We put together a <a href="https://sculptnation.com/testboost">2-minute at home test</a> you can take to help determine if you have too much cortisol. We will tell you where you can go to take that in just a moment.</p>
<p>First, we want to give you a couple of methods to lower cortisol and fight TSR….</p>
<p><strong>Manage Stress Levels (mental and physical)</strong><br />
The most effective way to lower your cortisol levels is to get your stress under control. Stress is not just mental .. it can be any physical stress you are placing on your body as well.</p>
<p><strong>Focus on quality sleep</strong><br />
You need 7-9 hours of quality sleep every single night (minimum) to keep your cortisol levels in check. This can be virtually impossible if your cortisol is high because cortisol regulates your sleep/wake cycle.</p>
<p><strong>These changes are challenging to adhere to!</strong> Avoiding cortisol spiking stressors is pretty much IMPOSSIBLE! We face stress every day. Even dieting and exercising can cause your body to be “stressed out.” And how can you get quality sleep if your sleep/wake cycle is messed up!?</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>Thankfully… THERE IS ONE OTHER WAY TO HELP FIGHT BACK!!!</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>Focus on diet &amp; supplementing with cortisol lowering/test boosting support supplements…</strong></em> There are some nutrients you can take daily that help support a reduction in cortisol levels, as well as a few foods you should try to TOTALLY AVOID.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://sculptnation.com/testboost" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>CLICK HERE to discover&#8230;</strong></em></a><br />
<em><strong>AN EASY and SCIENTIFICALLY backed way to give your body the </strong></em><br />
<em><strong>cortisol crushing nutrients it needs&#8230;</strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>The 4 foods you need to avoid…</strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>A 2-minute quiz to help you determine if your cortisol is high ..</strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>++ More on that groundbreaking testosterone/cortisol study&#8230;</strong></em></p>
<p>Researchers also found that the effects cortisol have on testosterone are reversed when stress levels go down.</p>
<p>This is GOOD NEWS! Now that we know that high cortisol blocking your testosterone IS an issue… we can fight back!!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>In this video, we explain everything you need to know about TSR and </strong></em><br />
<em><strong>an effective approach to knocking it out! </strong></em><br />

<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>THE LONGER YOU WAIT &#8211; THE WORSE THINGS WILL GET</strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Your body will continue to struggle as this testosterone suppression response continues, and it will only get worse if you don&#8217;t take charge and destroy your ability to make and use testosterone.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>Boosting your testosterone is great, but it’s a complete waste of time</strong></em><br />
<em><strong>if you aren’t blocking cortisol too.</strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>We have discovered <a href="https://sculptnation.com/testboost" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">THE ONLY testosterone maximizing method</a> available that is specifically designed to support healthy testosterone while minimizing and balancing the effects of cortisol.</strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://sculptnation.com/testboost" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>CLICK HERE TO FIND OUT FOR YOURSELF</strong></em></a></p>

<p>Probably traits passed down from your parents .. like your eye and hair color, the shape of your nose, maybe even your hot temper, and of course, the shape of your body.</p>
<p>You have probably heard someone say something similar to this (and possibly even said it yourself) &#8230;<em><strong>“Everyone in my family is overweight. It doesn’t matter what I do, it’s my genetics.”</strong></em></p>
<p>Yes, genetics can determine where you store fat, how much muscle you can pack on, how wide your hips are, and even how your body responds to certain foods. We even preach the importance of <a href="https://vshred.com/sp/survey/survey-aka1/">training and eating for your specific body type</a> because <em><strong>our FIXED genes can influence many aspects of who we are</strong></em>.</p>
<p>We can’t control the genes we’ve been given. But when it comes to how well you can drop body fat… <em><strong>the finger may need to be pointed at a second set of genes you didn’t get from your parents.</strong></em></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-6899 size-full" src="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/AdobeStock_216416516.jpeg?resize=1170%2C741&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1170" height="741" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/AdobeStock_216416516.jpeg?w=5760&amp;ssl=1 5760w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/AdobeStock_216416516.jpeg?resize=300%2C190&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/AdobeStock_216416516.jpeg?resize=768%2C486&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/AdobeStock_216416516.jpeg?resize=1024%2C649&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/AdobeStock_216416516.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/AdobeStock_216416516.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1170px) 100vw, 1170px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><strong>The Second Genome</strong><br />
There are over 37 trillion “human” cells in our bodies that contain our DNA, and <em><strong>the majority of these cells ARE NOT hereditary genes.</strong></em></p>
<p>It’s a “second set of genes” that researchers call our second genome. Unlike your inherited genes, which are more or less fixed, this second set of genes is not.</p>
<p>57% of the cells that make YOU who YOU ARE and live in your body are not passed down by your parents.</p>
<p><em><strong>THIS IS GOOD NEWS</strong></em> … we will tell you why and how you can reverse this a little further down in this article.</p>
<p>First, let’s explain what this “second genome” is.</p>
<p>This second set of genes is a bunch of bacteria, fungi, parasites, and viruses! That’s right, you are mostly made up of a bunch of .. well .. bugs.</p>
<p>These microscopic organisms (<strong>called MICROBIOME</strong>) play a vital role in supporting the daily operation of your body.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-6900 size-full" src="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/AdobeStock_152941653.jpeg?resize=1170%2C941&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1170" height="941" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/AdobeStock_152941653.jpeg?w=7000&amp;ssl=1 7000w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/AdobeStock_152941653.jpeg?resize=300%2C241&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/AdobeStock_152941653.jpeg?resize=768%2C618&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/AdobeStock_152941653.jpeg?resize=1024%2C824&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/AdobeStock_152941653.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/AdobeStock_152941653.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1170px) 100vw, 1170px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>You name it&#8230; your microbiome helps it function.</p>
<ul>
<li>Food Digestion</li>
<li>Nutrient Absorption</li>
<li>Energy Production</li>
<li>Immune System Regulation (⅔ of our immune system resides in the gut)</li>
<li>Skin Health</li>
<li>Mental Health/Brain Function</li>
<li>++ MORE</li>
</ul>
<p>These microbes live everywhere in your body! Bacteria is the most common organism, and the vast majority takes residency in your gut.</p>
<p>A healthy adult will have about FIVE POUNDS of bacteria in their colon. Some are BENEFICIAL… others are HARMFUL!</p>
<p>If you have too much unfriendly bacteria, that is when you may start to have<br />
adverse effects such as&#8230;</p>
<ul>
<li>GI Discomfort (occasional bloating, constipation, diarrhea, indigestion)</li>
<li>Fatigue</li>
<li>Brian Fog</li>
<li>Difficulty Losing Weight</li>
<li>A Sluggish Immune System</li>
<li>Nutrition Deficiency</li>
<li>Unrestful Sleep</li>
<li>++ MORE</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>Here is THE GOOD NEWS &#8230;</strong></em></p>
<p>The organisms live in you today may not be the same as the ones that colonize next week. They are constantly changing and have been since the day you were born.</p>
<p>This means you have the ability to impact what could be holding you back from reaching your fitness goals AND feeling your best mentally and physically.</p>
<p>But this can only happen if you take <em><strong>a very specific and proactive approach</strong></em> to ensure you are swapping out that “bad” bacteria with good bacteria .. or at least maintaining a proper balance of the two.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>You need to reach something called “Microbial Harmony.”</strong></em></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-6901 size-full" src="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/AdobeStock_292486431.jpeg?resize=1170%2C781&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1170" height="781" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/AdobeStock_292486431.jpeg?w=6004&amp;ssl=1 6004w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/AdobeStock_292486431.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/AdobeStock_292486431.jpeg?resize=768%2C513&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/AdobeStock_292486431.jpeg?resize=1024%2C684&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/AdobeStock_292486431.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/AdobeStock_292486431.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1170px) 100vw, 1170px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><strong>What Is Microbial Harmony?</strong><br />
We all have our own “Microbiome Blueprint” that is as unique as your fingerprint … nobody else has YOUR exact microbiome. Even identical twins are made up of a totally different accumulation of microbial life.</p>
<p>Researchers have also found that the organisms that live in people of a healthy weight are VERY DIFFERENT than those that are overweight. This strongly suggests&#8230; <em><strong>having a healthy balance of bacteria likely play a crucial role in our ability to lose weight.</strong></em></p>
<p>The reason our microbiome is so individual (and continually changing) is most likely a result of our personal lifestyle practices as well as our interactions with the world around us.</p>
<ul>
<li>Eating too many processed foods</li>
<li>Lack of micro-nutrient diversity</li>
<li>Not exercising</li>
<li>Environmental toxins (in the air you breathe, the water you drink and bathe in, foods you consume, surfaces you touch, pollution, etc.)</li>
<li>Stress</li>
<li>Age</li>
</ul>
<p>As you see… some of these things you do have total control over… others, not so much!</p>
<p>If you are serious about wanting to get in the best shape of your life and feel even better than you look… <em><strong>you need to take GUT HEALTH seriously.</strong></em></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Action Step #1</strong></span><br />
STOP being so quick to “blame” your genetics for every setback and issue with your health and take responsibility for what you are (or aren’t) doing to contribute.<br />
Unlike the genes your ancestors gave you, many of your issues could be tied to your second genome, and reversing that is somewhat in your control!</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Action Step #2</strong></span><br />
Remove (or add) the things you have control over. Things such as .. lowering your stress levels, getting enough sleep, eliminating or reducing processed foods, and exercising regularly.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Action Step #3</strong></span><br />
This step is the most important and something you have COMPLETE control over.<br />
You have to replenish your healthy bacteria. To do this, you have to feed your gut healthy bacteria.</p>
<p>There are two ways you can go about this&#8230;.</p>
<p>You could attempt to incorporate very specific high quality prebiotic and probiotic foods that are rich in healthy bacteria.</p>
<p>This would include consistently consuming LARGE amounts of things like…</p>
<ul>
<li>Yogurt</li>
<li>Kefir</li>
<li>Kimchi or Sauerkraut</li>
<li>Raw/Organic Fruits &amp; Vegetables</li>
<li>Specific Nuts and Beans</li>
<li>Seeds (such as chia and flax)</li>
<li>++ MORE</li>
</ul>
<p>Most people would never be able to eat this type of variety every single day.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>Or&#8230; you could go the much easier and better route!</strong></em></p>
<p>Our product formulation team at Sculpt Nation studied HUNDREDS of gut-beneficial strains of bacteria and narrowed it down to 7 KEY STRAINS that you need daily to achieve Microbial Harmony.</p>
<p>These strains deliver over 3.8 BILLION colony-forming units of microbiome-boosting bacteria that will get your gut in a balanced “harmonized” state.</p>
<p>Our researchers also discovered that this bacteria has to have a very type of specific FOOD to survive and thrive!</p>
<p>It took our team over 18 months to get this formula right, and we are FINALLY ready and eager to pass it on to you!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="https://sculptnation.com/probiotics-mini-vsl-v9"><em><strong>Discover how to achieve Microbial Harmony&#8230; in SECONDS!</strong></em></a></p>
<p><a href="https://sculptnation.com/probiotics-mini-vsl-v9"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-7409" src="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/ezgif-2-caba50571434.gif?resize=600%2C554&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="600" height="554" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><em><strong>THE TRUTH IS…..</strong></em><br />
Most of us are in a state of “Microbial Chaos” that puts your body in a position that makes it IMPOSSIBLE to look, feel, and function at your best.</p>
<p><em><strong>YOU ARE NOT STUCK!</strong> </em><br />
What makes YOU (you) .. is more than the DNA passed down from your bloodline! We simply overlook the fact that our microbiome has a KEY role in so many of our body (and brain) functions.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>Experts say that we have more bacteria in our guts than we do cells in our entire body!</strong></em><br />
<em><strong>So many … that they estimate we are only 10% human &#8230; and 90% bacteria!</strong></em></p>
<p>If that doesn’t tell you just how vital GUT HEALTH is … we aren’t sure what will!</p>
<p><em><strong>DO NOT DELAY!</strong></em> We really can’t overstate the importance of gut health and achieving the Microbial Harmony needed to achieve that.</p>
<p>An angry gut is no small thing!<br />
Start taking charge of your health and properly achieve Microbial Harmony today!!</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Is Your Gut Bacteria Balanced?</strong><br />
<strong>If not, that explains a lot <em>(maybe even your weight gain)</em></strong></p>
<p><em><strong>“What is on the inside will be reflected on the outside.”</strong></em> &#8212; Don’t worry, we aren’t about to give you a Ted Talk about the importance of inner beauty (but that is important too)</p>
<p>We are about to tell you how VITAL it is that you invest in GUT HEALTH so your body can be healthy enough inside to build muscle and burn fat … <em><strong>and look the way you want it to on the outside.</strong></em></p>
<p>We’ve got a <em><strong>gut instinct</strong></em> that most of you have at least one of the following issues.</p>
<ul>
<li>Occasional Bloating</li>
<li>Occasional Gas</li>
<li>Occasional Constipation</li>
<li>Occasional Diarrhea</li>
<li>Brain Fog</li>
<li>Unrestful Sleep</li>
<li>Exhaustion</li>
<li>A sluggish immune system</li>
<li>Difficulty losing weight</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: center;">We also have a <em><strong>gut feeling</strong></em> as to why.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-6894 size-full" src="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/AdobeStock_140658974.jpeg?resize=1170%2C780&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1170" height="780" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/AdobeStock_140658974.jpeg?w=5760&amp;ssl=1 5760w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/AdobeStock_140658974.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/AdobeStock_140658974.jpeg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/AdobeStock_140658974.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/AdobeStock_140658974.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/AdobeStock_140658974.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1170px) 100vw, 1170px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>Actually… WE KNOW WHY!</p>
<p>Because science tells us that these things could all be happening because… <em><strong>your gut isn’t healthy!</strong></em></p>
<p>You probably already know that an unhealthy gut can be the cause of GI distress.<br />
<em><strong>But the guts connection to WEIGHT LOSS and YOUR IMMUNE SYSTEM</strong></em>…. Might be something you have never considered!</p>
<p><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>In this article, we will explain:</strong></span></em></p>
<ul>
<li>How probiotics can help you lose weight!</li>
<li>How probiotics boost immunity!</li>
<li>How to get your gut health back with probiotics (and what they are.)</li>
<li>The best probiotics strains for whole-body health (and the problem with most on store shelves.)</li>
<li>The OTHER “biotic” your body needs for probiotics to do their job.</li>
</ul>
<p>Before we dive into <em><strong>how your gut could be hindering your ability to lose weight…</strong></em><br />
we need to talk about HOW to get your gut in a balanced and healthy state.</p>
<p>The best way to ensure your gut is happy (and as a result, helps your entire body function properly) is to feed it with&#8230;<em><strong> the right balance of GOOD bacteria.</strong></em></p>
<p>Over 100 trillion microorganisms live in your body. Your gut has been taken over by much of this bacteria since birth.</p>
<p>Bacteria isn’t always a “bad word”.. your gut needs certain types of bacteria to have optimal digestion, healthy immune system function, and a strong metabolism.</p>
<p><em><strong>It becomes “bad” when harmful bacteria take over.</strong></em></p>
<p>Our intestines are under constant attack. A diet lacking diversity and essential micronutrients, stress, toxins in our environment, genetics, and aging, can all cause BAD bacteria to populate.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>You have to balance this out with GOOD bacteria!</strong></em></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-6885 size-full" src="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/AdobeStock_312008058.jpeg?resize=1170%2C752&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1170" height="752" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/AdobeStock_312008058.jpeg?w=4200&amp;ssl=1 4200w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/AdobeStock_312008058.jpeg?resize=300%2C193&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/AdobeStock_312008058.jpeg?resize=768%2C494&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/AdobeStock_312008058.jpeg?resize=1024%2C658&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/AdobeStock_312008058.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/AdobeStock_312008058.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1170px) 100vw, 1170px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><em><strong>Here is how you do that….</strong></em><br />
The best way to support gut health and fight the imbalances that may cause GI issues (and possibly weight gain), is to improve your nutrition and create healthy lifestyle habits.</p>
<p>Exercise .. that’s easy enough.<br />
Nutrition … that’s where things get tricky.</p>
<p>To balance out gut bacteria, you need to figure out how to eat a bunch of food that contains <em><strong>a perfect mix of VERY specific probiotics and prebiotics.</strong></em></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>For reference….</strong></span><br />
<em>Probiotics</em> … are live bacteria. It’s the food your gut likes and needs to stay healthy.<br />
<em>Prebiotics</em> … feed this good bacteria. Think of them as “fertilizer” for probiotics.</p>
<p>Here is a glance at a few of the things you would need to eat (daily) to feed your gut with enough prebiotics and probiotics to make your gut flora balanced, healthy, and happy.</p>
<ul>
<li>Lots of raw/organic veggies and fruits</li>
<li>Some nuts and beans.</li>
<li>Fiber sources such as flax and chia seeds.</li>
<li>A few fermented foods like kimchi, sauerkraut, yogurt, or unpasteurized cheese.</li>
<li>Some foods like coconut, ginger, and olive oil.</li>
</ul>
<p>Are you REALLY going to eat THAT MUCH VARIETY every single day? And can you imagine how expensive it would be to purchase QUALITY foods like this in high amounts?</p>
<p>Wouldn’t it be much easier to take one capsule with meals and know you are giving your gut exactly what it needs to thrive (and set you up for your weight loss goals.)</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>Exactly why we developed <a href="https://sculptnation.com/products/probiotics">Sculpt Nation Probiotics</a>!</strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://sculptnation.com/products/probiotics"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6921" src="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/ezgif-2-bc5238f7a928.gif?resize=600%2C600&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="600" height="600" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

<strong>Today only! <a href="https://sculptnation.com/products/probiotics">==&gt; CLICK HERE</a></strong></p>
<p>For years, we have been studying all of the latest research on gut health. Before we released a Probiotic, we wanted to make sure it was only the best on the market.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>Mission accomplished &#8211; <a href="https://sculptnation.com/products/probiotics">Sculpt Nation Probiotics</a> are now available!</strong></em></p>
<p>We know that there are THOUSANDS of probiotics on store shelves. You are probably asking yourself what makes ours any different?</p>
<p><em><strong>Here are a few problems with most probiotics….</strong></em></p>
<ul>
<li>Most are nothing more than tablets filled with only a few (if any) LIVE and ACTIVE probiotics.</li>
<li>They do not contain the RIGHT BLEND of bacteria.</li>
<li>Most generic probiotics products starve your beneficial bacteria because they don’t include PREbiotics.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>We wanted to take out all of the confusion.</strong></p>
<p>Rather than spending countless hours asking Google, or scanning every store shelf totally overwhelmed with all of the options,<em><strong> we developed the most powerful and complete blend of “gut food” that money can buy!</strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><em><strong>Here is a breakdown of what every <a href="https://sculptnation.com/products/probiotics">Sculpt Nation PROBIOTICS </a>serving contains.</strong></em></p>
<p>Let’s start with the ingredient most probiotics on the market DO NOT HAVE… but should!</p>
<p>It’s not a Probiotic.<br />
It is a PRE-biotic.</p>
<p><em><strong>We briefly touched on this earlier but to re-cap…</strong></em>PREbiotics are different than PRObiotics.</p>
<p>PREbiotics are not bacteria. They are a special type of fiber that feeds your good bacteria.</p>
<p>Most of the fiber you eat from your diet is not this type of special type of fiber; one reason why supplementing with it is important!</p>
<p>The prebiotic we choose to put in our <a href="https://sculptnation.com/products/probiotics">Sculpt Nation Probiotic Blend</a> is called INULIN <em>(a unique type of prebiotic fiber found in plants.)</em></p>
<p>Look at prebiotics and probiotics as a team. Probiotics need food to work. That food is prebiotics. <em><strong>You shouldn’t be supplementing with one… and not the other.</strong></em></p>
<p><a href="https://sculptnation.com/products/probiotics"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6916" src="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Probiotics.png?resize=800%2C828&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="800" height="828" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Probiotics.png?w=800&amp;ssl=1 800w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Probiotics.png?resize=290%2C300&amp;ssl=1 290w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Probiotics.png?resize=768%2C795&amp;ssl=1 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><em><strong>Okay, now let’s move on to the 7 LIVE PROBIOTICS in our unique PROBIOTICS blend.</strong></em></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Bacillus Coagulans</strong> &#8211; Shown to help support protein absorption and recovery from exercise. This results in reduced muscle damage and soreness. Other studies show it helps reduce occasional bloating.</li>
<li><strong>Lactobacillus Acidophilus</strong> &#8211; This is one of the strongest, most researched, and most well-known probiotics. Studies rave about its ability to help promote better digestive health, support regularity and strengthen immune system function.</li>
<li><strong>Bifidobacterium Bifidum</strong> &#8211; This is an important one because it makes up around 80% of your intestinal microflora. Studies show it can help with occasional stress, increase levels of good bacteria in the gut, and act as an antioxidant.</li>
<li><strong>Bifidobacterium Longum</strong> &#8211; This one can also combat stress, as well as help support learning, boost memory, and improve mood.</li>
<li><strong>Strepococcus Thermophilius</strong> &#8211; Shown to help support a healthy immune system, promote oral health, and the overall composition of your gut’s microflora.</li>
<li><strong>Lactobacillus Bulgaricus (Delbrueckii)</strong> &#8211; Another research-backed and very powerful immune system booster.</li>
<li><strong>Lactobacillus Paracasei</strong> &#8211; Can support the strength of your intestinal barrier, aid in nutrient absorption, and help with immune system health.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Now that you understand HOW TO FEED YOUR GUT </strong><em><strong>(and what makes <a href="https://sculptnation.com/products/probiotics">OUR BLEND</a> unique)</strong></em><br />
<strong>Let’s go over how PROBIOTICS may help you lose weight!</strong></p>
<p><img class="size-large wp-image-6914" src="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/AdobeStock_314724372.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/AdobeStock_314724372.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/AdobeStock_314724372.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/AdobeStock_314724372.jpeg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/AdobeStock_314724372.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/AdobeStock_314724372.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>Numerous studies have found that overweight people have different gut bacteria than either normal-weight or skinny people.<br />
We could stop here, and you would probably be sold on the fact that <em><strong>a healthy gut can NO DOUBT can have an impact on your weight.</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>But let’s keep going&#8230;</strong></em><br />
Researchers have conducted studies where they transplanted gut bacteria from obese mice into the guts of lean mice&#8230;and the lean mice got fat!!</p>
<p><em><strong>Crazy, right?!</strong></em></p>
<p>Studies like this make it pretty evident that gut bacteria play a significant role in weight regulation.</p>
<p><em><strong>But how?!</strong></em></p>
<ul>
<li>Probiotics may help release a hormone in your body that tells you you are full. Higher levels of this appetite-reducing hormone (GLP-1) also help you burn more fat.</li>
<li>Probiotics may support improved fat metabolism by encouraging an increase in levels of a protein called ANGPTL4 (a circulating protein involved in the regulation of fatty acid metabolism.)</li>
<li>Probiotics may support a healthy, normal inflammatory response, which can contribute to weight issues.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Probiotics can play a POWERFUL role in weight management</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Plus… let’s not forget the many other reasons to take a probiotic supplement… like improved GI health, energy balance, emotional support, optimal brain health, and immune support.<br />
But they are not magic pills.</p>
<p><strong>Probiotics &amp; Your Immune System</strong><br />
70-80% of immune cells live in your gut. It makes perfect sense that if your gut isn’t healthy, your immune system won’t be either!</p>
<p>We’ve already told you the numerous ways probiotics strengthen your gut. Because of that you are already helping support the strength of your immune system. This is especially important for immune support because the intestinal lining contains specialized cells to maintain health during times of challenge.</p>
<p>Beyond that, quality probiotics have also been demonstrated to support immunity by boosting immune cells and increasing key immune-boosting antibodies.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>Probiotics are not magic pills.</strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">They are just one tool in your arsenal for creating a healthier you.<br />
You need to combine supplements with a healthy diet and regular training program to get the best results.<br />
Nutrients that give you the energy to work out are crucial. Eat a blend of lean proteins, healthy fats, vitamin-rich fruits, and vegetables (or a powdered supplement like <strong><a href="https://sculptnation.com/products/greens">THESE</a></strong>.)</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Meal prepping helps you stay committed to a good diet.</p>
<p>Let me show you how to do it</p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TT57UfsWGWU" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>Add in our probiotic blend to ensure your gut flora is happy, healthy, and able to thrive, and<br />
you will be well on your way to your best (from the inside, out) in no time!</p>

<strong>Because We Aren&#8217;t Having Enough Of It.</strong><br />
<strong>[Let’s Talk About… S E X]</strong></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-6772 size-full" src="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/AdobeStock_234630586.jpeg?resize=1170%2C720&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1170" height="720" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/AdobeStock_234630586.jpeg?w=6500&amp;ssl=1 6500w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/AdobeStock_234630586.jpeg?resize=300%2C185&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/AdobeStock_234630586.jpeg?resize=768%2C473&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/AdobeStock_234630586.jpeg?resize=1024%2C630&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/AdobeStock_234630586.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/AdobeStock_234630586.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1170px) 100vw, 1170px" data-recalc-dims="1" /><br />
Often, the topics we avoid discussing are the ones that need to be talked about the most! Sex no doubt tops the list of subjects we tend to shy away from.</p>
<p><em>Whether it’s…</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Having a heart-to-heart with your significant other about your sexual activity as a couple.</li>
<li>Discussing the birds and the bees with your kids.</li>
<li>Talking about your bedroom habits with your doctor.</li>
<li>A chit chat with your friends.</li>
</ul>
<p>Talking about sex <em>(and often the lack of)</em> can be uncomfortable.</p>
<p>We aren’t trying to make you feel uneasy, but research shows that lack of sex is a huge problem in relationships these days, and the trickle-down effect can be devastating.</p>
<p>We know because we’ve heard endless stories. Stories like this one from an anonymous member of the V Shred family…</p>
<p><em>“One day, out of nowhere, it just happened. I no longer felt the urge to have sex. I made every excuse in the world, but the truth was that I didn’t really have one. I wanted sex. I wanted my body to want sex as much as my mind and my heart did.. but it just didn’t. I was in my early 30’s and deeply in love with my husband. How could this be happening? My doctor told me this was a normal thing for women to experience and sent me home. Ultimately, my lack of desire caused me to have severe depression,I lacked self confidence, and I felt like less of a woman. It also caused my husband to have low-self esteem and question my fidelity. Our marriage got a little rocky. Once I finally got to the bottom of why this was happening, I got my life back.”</em></p>

<p><strong>Does this sound familiar?</strong><br />
Today we are going to tell you what this woman discovered to be her issue&#8230;It very well may be why YOUR sex drive is low too!</p>
<p><strong>If so, the good news is that there may be <a href="https://sculptnation.com/products/hgh-boost?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=post&amp;utm_campaign=v-shred&amp;utm_content=Vday-Blog-F-HGHBoost&amp;utm_term=77907521">a SIMPLE APPROACH to getting it back</a>.</strong></p>
<p>First of all, we want to point out that you should NEVER judge your sex drive based on someone else’s. Just like we all have different body types, we are all wired with varying levels of sexual desire.</p>
<p>The best way to determine if your sex drive is low is to look back and compare it to how it was 5, 10, 20, 30 years ago.</p>
<p>If you notice a downward trend in your personal sexual appetite, that is when you have to try and pinpoint WHY your libido has gone from va-va-voom .. to gloom!</p>
<p>Sometimes, low libido is due to emotional distress. It can even solely be because of a relationship issue. But often, the reason desire is low is because some of your hormones aren’t sitting at prime levels!</p>
<p>Sex hormones can be out of balance for a variety of reasons. Age, diet, and exercise habits to name a few.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re struggling from any signs that point to low hormone levels, you should see a healthcare professional for proper care.</p>
<p><strong>But … often your sex hormones<a href="https://sculptnation.com/products/hgh-boost?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=post&amp;utm_campaign=v-shred&amp;utm_content=Vday-Blog-F-HGHBoost&amp;utm_term=77907521"> just need a little boost!</a></strong></p>
<p>Several hormones contribute to how robust your sex drive is, one of the most important is something called Human Growth Hormone (HGH.)</p>
<p>HGH is something our body produces naturally. It is made by a tiny gland at the base of your brain called the pituitary gland.</p>
<p>HGH is what helps us grow when we are kids. Then, as we age, it helps maintain a variety of organs and tissues.</p>
<p>But with age, the pituitary gland slowly reduces the amount of HGH it produces. This can happen as early as age 18, but it really starts it’s downward spiral beginning in middle age.</p>
<p>You may have seen hormone doctors on TV or in advertisements claiming HGH could be the “fountain of youth” that will restore your aesthetics to their wrinkle-free glowing youth.</p>
<p>Research is pretty mixed on if this claim is valid, but one thing most doctors and scientists agree to be fact…</p>
<p><strong>Having lower HGH can no doubt put your body into a state that dictates your desire to have sex.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-6774 size-full" src="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/lowHGH-symptoms.png?resize=1170%2C458&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1170" height="458" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/lowHGH-symptoms.png?w=1640&amp;ssl=1 1640w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/lowHGH-symptoms.png?resize=300%2C117&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/lowHGH-symptoms.png?resize=768%2C301&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/lowHGH-symptoms.png?resize=1024%2C401&amp;ssl=1 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1170px) 100vw, 1170px" data-recalc-dims="1" /><br />
<strong>Here are a few reasons why….</strong></p>
<p><strong>Human Growth Hormone can determine body composition.</strong><br />
A common and well-known reason people don’t want to have sex is that they don’t like the way their body looks naked.</p>
<p>Lower levels of GH could impact your metabolism, how your body utilizes and stores fat, it’s response to insulin/blood sugar levels, and how well you retain lean muscle mass.</p>
<p>All of these things could play a part in how well your body responds to training and nutrition!</p>
<p><strong>Human Growth Hormone is essential for brain health.</strong><br />
You may not realize it, but your desire to have sex begins before you “feel it” because the urge starts much higher up .. in your head!</p>
<p>HGH production is controlled by a set of hormones produced in a particular region of the brain, as well as your pancreas and intestinal tract. This means that lower levels of GH could affect many cognitive functions, such as mental alertness, motivation, and emotions.</p>
<p>When these things are off… your desire to have sex could be impacted.</p>
<p><strong>Human Growth Hormone can help you sleep.</strong><br />
The number one excuse for not having sex is probably .. I’m too tired!</p>
<p>Experts estimate that up to 75 percent of our HGH is released while we sleep. If you aren’t snoozing, your HGH levels will suffer!</p>
<p>Another way that HGH affects sleep is that it can reduce cortisol (the stress hormone) levels. When your cortisol is too high, the quality and duration of your sleep could suffer.</p>
<p><strong>Human Growth Hormone can impact cell regeneration.</strong><br />
Continuing with how HGH can impact aesthetics, slow cell turnover is what can cause your hair to appear thinner, increase the appearance of wrinkles, and cause your skin to start sagging. These are all things that can no doubt leave you less confident!</p>
<p><strong>Human Growth Hormone can increase blood flow.</strong><br />
We aren’t going to spell this one out for you. Just stop and think about why blood flow would be necessary for you to have a better sex life!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>What can you do to give your HGH levels a NATURAL BOOST?!</strong></p>

<p><strong>1. Get 7-9 Hours Of Quality Sleep.</strong><br />
As mentioned above, our bodies naturally release the most HGH while we are sleeping. If you need some help with catching quality Zzzz’s, you may want to check out <a href="https://sculptnation.com/products/burn-pm">BURN PM</a>. This product is a powerful naturally formulated sleep support enhancer that is packed with both nighttime fat-burners and relaxation &amp; recovery agents.</p>
<p><strong>2. Incorporate High-Intensity Interval Training.</strong><br />
Short bursts of cardio intervals have been proven to improve HGH levels throughout the day. The tougher those bursts of energy are… the higher the boost of HGH! If you need some ideas for HIIT workouts, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCOFCwvhDoUvYcfpD7RJKQwA">we have hundreds of ideas and follow along videos on our YOUTUBE channel.</a></p>
<p><strong>3. Eat Enough Protein (especially around workouts).</strong><br />
Studies have shown that protein can promote increased HGH levels. The easiest (and most delicious) way to hit your protein goals is with our <a href="https://sculptnation.com/products/protein?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=post&amp;utm_campaign=v-shred&amp;utm_content=Vday-Blog-F-Protein&amp;utm_term=77907521">Sculpt Nation PROTEIN</a>. It’s easy to shake one up on the go, but you can also use it to make some tasty treats, <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/pumpkin-spice-protein/">like protein pancakes</a>!</p>
<p><strong>4. Lose A Little More Fat.</strong><br />
Excess fat deposits (especially in the abdomen) have been linked to lower levels of HGH. Try taking our <a href="https://vshred.com/sp/survey/survey-aka1/?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=post&amp;utm_campaign=v-shred&amp;utm_content=Vday-Blog-F-Quiz&amp;utm_term=77907521">FREE BODY TYPE QUIZ</a> to see what diet and exercise may help you blast fat most effectively!</p>
<p><strong>5. Take very specific researched backed natural herbs and adaptogens.</strong><br />
We saved the most crucial suggestion for last. Many people are already dieting, exercising, sleeping, and getting adequate protein, but are still struggling with lower HGH levels. For this reason, supplementing with some very specific vitamins and herbs could be your missing link!</p>
<p>Steps 1-4 are overall pretty self-explanatory. But knowing which supplements to take, figuring out what brands are trustworthy, and then nailing down the proper dosage for each one to even be effective .. that takes lots of time, money, and research!</p>

<p>We know, we know! Talking about the birds and the bees is uncomfortable&#8230; But we can’t hold out on giving you this information! READ THIS AND GET YOUR SEX DRIVE BACK!!</p>
<p><em>I have a headache.</em><br />
<em>I am too exhausted.</em><br />
<em>I feel “fat” today.</em><br />
<em>I had a terrible day.</em><br />
<em>I have to take care of the kids.</em><br />
<em>I am too sore from my V Shred workout.</em></p>
<p>We have all had a reason to turn down some bump n’ grind.. getting frisky.. knocking boots.. doing a little mattress dancing. Okay, okay, we’ll stop. We’re blushing too!</p>
<p><strong>But what if (most of the time) the reason you aren’t in the mood has nothing to do with any of that?</strong></p>
<p>What if you are just as frustrated about your lack of desire as your partner is?</p>
<p><strong>You WANT to be intimate with your partner but can’t figure out WHY you no longer have the URGE?</strong></p>
<p>There isn’t a “universal norm” when it comes to sex drive.</p>
<p>Everyone’s sexual appetite is different and not feeling that “spark” can be influenced by numerous things, some of which are relational and emotional.</p>
<p>But many people find themselves in a different situation. Their libido is low and they can’t seem to get in the mood … <strong>but they have no idea why?!</strong></p>
<p>If this is you… <strong>There may be A SIMPLE REASON and ALL-NATURAL APPROACH</strong><br />
<strong>that will help reboot your sexual health!</strong></p>
<p>There is a hormone your body needs to feel frisky.</p>
<p>It’s called <em>Testosterone</em>.</p>
<p>Testosterone belongs to a class of male hormones (called androgens). You have to have optimal testosterone levels to not only have a roaring libido but to be able to lose fat, grow muscle, and function normally!</p>
<p><a href="https://sculptnation.com/products/test-boost?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=post&amp;utm_campaign=v-shred&amp;utm_content=Vday-Blog-M-TestBoost&amp;utm_term=77907521"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-6767 size-full" src="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/info-testlevels-TESTBOOST-SN-Page.png?resize=1170%2C1286&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1170" height="1286" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/info-testlevels-TESTBOOST-SN-Page.png?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/info-testlevels-TESTBOOST-SN-Page.png?resize=273%2C300&amp;ssl=1 273w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/info-testlevels-TESTBOOST-SN-Page.png?resize=768%2C844&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/info-testlevels-TESTBOOST-SN-Page.png?resize=932%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 932w" sizes="(max-width: 1170px) 100vw, 1170px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><strong>WHAT CAUSES TESTOSTERONE TO BECOME LOW?</strong></p>
<p>Testosterone levels can take a nose-dive for MANY reasons…</p>
<ul>
<li>OBESITY</li>
<li>HORMONAL DISORDERS</li>
<li>TYPE 2 DIABETES</li>
<li>CERTAIN DISEASE/CHRONIC ILLNESS</li>
<li>CERTAIN MEDICATIONS</li>
<li>STRESS</li>
<li>POOR DIET (including over dieting)</li>
<li>ALCOHOL ABUSE</li>
<li>AGE (After 30, testosterone levels decrease every year naturally)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>WHAT CAN YOU DO ABOUT IT?</strong><br />
To find out if your testosterone levels are in a healthy range, you would need to see a doctor and get bloodwork done.</p>
<p>If you are having any significant signs associated with low testosterone levels, we suggest you make a doctor&#8217;s appointment and get checked out!</p>
<p>But for many of us, our testosterone levels simply aren’t OPTIMAL.</p>
<p>Here at V Shred and Sculpt Nation, we spent a lot of time researching what it can do to the body when testosterone isn’t in an optimal range.</p>
<p>Once we did our homework and discovered there could be a <strong>NATURAL APPROACH</strong>, we sought out to find THE MOST HIGH-QUALITY form of these very specific science-backed herbs and adaptogens. Then we nailed down the proper combinations and dosages that would make these natural ingredients the most effective!</p>
<p><strong>The result?</strong></p>

<p><strong>LISTEN ….</strong><br />
Don’t you want to give your significant other (and yourself) the gift of&#8230; a robust sex life!?</p>
<p>Heck, forget about ONE day! What about the other 364?!</p>
<p>New research just came out that says that the percentage of American adults not having sex has reached a record high.</p>
<p><strong>Here is a look at just some of the <em>sextistics</em> out there….</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The portion of Americans age 18 to 29 reporting having <span style="text-decoration: underline;">no sex</span> more than doubled between 2008 and 2018, to 23 percent.</li>
<li>13 percent of married couples in the United States report having sex only a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">few times per year.</span></li>
<li>Only 26% of couples have sex <span style="text-decoration: underline;">once a week.</span> The majority do the deed only <span style="text-decoration: underline;">1-2x a month.</span></li>
<li>And get this .. 15 to 20 percent of couples are in a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">TOTALLY sexless relationship.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><em>TALK ABOUT SOME TRAGIC NUMBERS!</em> Low sex drive can affect all ages, all genders, and all relationships.</p>
<p>Not to mention, if you aren’t having enough sex, it could hurt way more than your ego.</p>
<p><strong>A healthy sex life…..</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Boosts Immunity</li>
<li>Helps Maintain Healthy Blood Pressure</li>
<li>Improves Sleep</li>
<li>Enhances Cognition</li>
<li>Eases Anxiety &amp; Stress</li>
<li>Boosts Self Esteem</li>
<li>Makes You More Affectionate</li>
<li>Burns Calories</li>
</ul>
<p>No doubt it has endless benefits.</p>
<p>But in order to want it, you most likely need to have optimal testosterone levels! Having lower testosterone can have many other effects on your brain and body!</p>

<ul>
<li>Lack of energy</li>
<li>A decrease in muscle mass</li>
<li>Hair loss</li>
<li>Loss of bone mass</li>
<li>Fatigue</li>

<p><em><strong>Will You Win Or Lose This Super Bowl Sunday?</strong></em></p>
<p>As the 49ers and Chiefs battle it out on the field, many of you will face your own game day battle&#8230; and we’ve got your defensive strategy!</p>
<p>You made it past the new year’s resolution hump <em>(the point when most people have already failed)</em> and are smashing your goals.</p>
<p><strong>Then… FOUL!!</strong></p>
<p>You are faced with an (unofficial) American holiday that is celebrated with lots of food.</p>
<p>Super Bowl Sunday is the second biggest food consumption day of the year! The only day that scores more calories is Thanksgiving.</p>
<p><strong>Here is what goes down in a matter of only a few hours&#8230;</strong></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-6687 size-large" src="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/AdobeStock_317072671-1.jpeg?resize=1024%2C672&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="672" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/AdobeStock_317072671-1.jpeg?resize=1024%2C672&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/AdobeStock_317072671-1.jpeg?resize=300%2C197&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/AdobeStock_317072671-1.jpeg?resize=768%2C504&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/AdobeStock_317072671-1.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/AdobeStock_317072671-1.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<ul>
<li>1.3 Billion Chicken Wings</li>
<li>2 Million Pizzas</li>
<li>10 Million Pounds of Ribs</li>
<li>88 Million Pounds of Cheese</li>
<li>9200 Tons of Chips</li>
<li>3 Million Pounds of Nuts</li>
<li>325.5 Million Gallons of Beer</li>
</ul>
<p>And that’s just a breakdown of the most popular Super Bowl foods!</p>
<p>So yeah, it’s safe to say that a calorie surplus is in the playbook for many Americans.</p>
<p>While we always preach that <em>“one meal”</em> or even <em>“one day”</em> of eating off your diet plan won’t hurt your overall progress, we’ll let you do the math on how this one day could be an exception.</p>
<p><em><strong>If we know that&#8230;</strong></em></p>
<p>A SURPLUS of 3,500 calories = 1 pound of weight gain.</p>
<p><em><strong>And it is estimated that…</strong></em></p>
<p>The average calories a person will consume on Super Bowl Sunday is 6,000!</p>
<p>It’s easy to see how scrambling back and forth to the buffet table could indeed result in a major poundage penalty, and we want to make sure you are ready to tackle the day!</p>
<p>It may seem like you can’t win unless you sit this one out on the sidelines, but being focused on losing weight does not mean you have to lose out on all the fun, or food!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>FOOLPROOF SUPER BOWL STRATEGY</strong></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-6675 size-large" src="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/superbowl-vince-01.png?resize=1024%2C1024&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="1024" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/superbowl-vince-01.png?resize=1024%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/superbowl-vince-01.png?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 150w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/superbowl-vince-01.png?resize=300%2C300&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/superbowl-vince-01.png?resize=768%2C768&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/superbowl-vince-01.png?resize=60%2C60&amp;ssl=1 60w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/superbowl-vince-01.png?w=1080&amp;ssl=1 1080w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>First… PICK A TEAM</strong><br />
When game day arrives, you should have a plan that starts with deciding which team you are going to be on.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Team <em>“Live-A-Little”</em> VS. Team <em>“Stick-To-The-Plan”</em></strong></p>
<p>We are placing our bets on&#8230;<strong> TEAM LIVE A LITTLE!</strong><br />
That’s because the odds are against you if you tell yourself you aren’t <em>“allowed”</em> to eat something. It is better to go slightly off your plan and practice mindfulness.</p>
<p>Sure, there is the risk that once you get a<em> “taste,”</em> you won’t be able to stop eating, but you have to learn to have willpower at some point. Let’s start mastering that right now!</p>
<p>Your goal is to walk in with a winning attitude.</p>
<p>You can’t let yourself feel ANY guilt about your decision to live a little. Next, you have to trust yourself to be disciplined enough to use mindfulness and moderation to avoid going overboard.</p>
<p><strong>Next… Your Pre-game plan.</strong></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-6719" src="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/superbowl-pregame-blog.png?resize=1024%2C1024&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="1024" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/superbowl-pregame-blog.png?resize=1024%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/superbowl-pregame-blog.png?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 150w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/superbowl-pregame-blog.png?resize=300%2C300&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/superbowl-pregame-blog.png?resize=768%2C768&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/superbowl-pregame-blog.png?resize=60%2C60&amp;ssl=1 60w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/superbowl-pregame-blog.png?w=1080&amp;ssl=1 1080w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><strong>Prepare A Healthy Dish</strong><br />
If you are hosting a party, then you have complete control and can modify almost every snack to be healthy or healthier! If you are attending a party, ask if you can bring something.</p>
<p><strong>Get In Your Workout</strong><br />
Get in your sweat session before the big game. If you tell yourself you’ll do it afterward; you are no doubt setting yourself up to lose!</p>
<p>Add a quick HIIT cardio session on to the end of your lift, like this one, and you will have the perks of that <em>“after-burn effect”</em> that continues well past the final Super Bowl buzzer!</p>
<p><strong>Do Not Calorie Hoard</strong><br />
While it may be tempting to save all your calories or starve yourself in preparation for a food surplus, that is overall a bad idea. Going to the party hungry will NO DOUBT lead to over-eating. At the same time, there is nothing wrong with saving some calories and being mindful in the hours leading up to the big game.</p>
<p>You can do this by having lower carb/fat meals and sticking with mainly lean proteins beforehand. Make sure you have a meal right before the festivities. Fill up a shaker with a <a href="https://sculptnation.com/products/protein">Sculpt Nation Protein</a> smoothie and drink up on your way there!</p>
<p><strong>Get A Good Night Of Sleep</strong><br />
Sleep deprivation not only gets your hormones out of whack, but grogginess also leads to bad decisions, such as overeating! Aim for 7-9 hours of shut-eye the night before the game!</p>

<p><strong>Now It’s Time For KICK-OFF… Implement This 5 Step Defensive Strategy</strong></p>
<p><strong>Survey the spread</strong><br />
Take a look at all your options. Think about what is in each dish, what may be the healthiest option and the most filling. Take a moment to ask yourself what you are really craving. Just because it is on the table doesn’t mean it has to make its way to your plate!</p>
<p><strong>Dive in with mindfulness and moderation</strong><br />
Let’s start with beverages. Drink LOTS of water and unless you can’t fathom game day without a beer or two, pass on empty calories found in alcoholic beverages. If you must have alcohol, opt for a light beer, or liquor paired with calorie-free mixers.</p>
<p>When it comes to food, fill the majority of your plate with lots of veggies and any proteins that aren’t battered, fried, or cheese covered. Then when it comes to the good stuff, skip anything that you aren’t DYING to have and include small portions of only the things you REALLY want.</p>
<p><strong>Avoid “BLT’S”</strong><br />
We aren’t talking about the sandwich. We are talking about those little bites, licks, and tastes. A handful of chips as you pass by the bowl, just one more piece of pizza, only a small taste of that buffalo dip, and sneaking a cube of cheese every time you pass by, could easily ALL ADD UP to a full day worth of calories (or more.)</p>
<p>One way to avoid “grazing” is after you make your plate, instead of eating everything all at once, nibble off of the plate you made for yourself. Once it’s empty .. that’s it, no more!</p>
<p><strong>Stay away from the buffet</strong><br />
The problem with parties is that the food stays out for hours! It’s always there waiting for you to have a BLT! Avoidance is the best strategy. After you fill your plate walk away and DO NOT RETURN!</p>
<p>Drink water, chew gum, stay occupied! Whatever you do, don’t head back into that penalty zone! Remember to graze off your plate, not the food spread!</p>
<p><strong>Actually watch the game</strong><br />
And the commercials..and the half-time show…Remember WHY you are surrounded by all that food to begin. Get into the game, jump up and down, and cheer on your team.</p>
<p>If you aren’t into sports but are going to a party anyway, find other ways to stay busy by keeping the conversation going with friends or even ask someone to take it outside for some yard games or a walk around the block. If you are busy socializing, you won’t be thinking about casually making your way back to the buffet!</p>
<p><em><strong>THE GAME IS OVER … Do Not Penalize Yourself</strong></em></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-6722" src="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/superbowl-game-over.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/superbowl-game-over.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/superbowl-game-over.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/superbowl-game-over.jpeg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/superbowl-game-over.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/superbowl-game-over.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /><br />
Even if your team wins, if you lost your food battle, you will most likely wake up on Monday with a flood of negative thoughts.</p>
<p>This is <strong>NEVER</strong> a good place to be!</p>
<p>Feelings of guilt can cause you to do some crazy things, like give up altogether, or think you have no chance at bouncing back.</p>
<p>DO NOT let these thoughts cause you to give up! Let’s use one of the biggest Super Bowl blunders of all time as an example.</p>
<p>At Super Bowl XXXVII, just as the game was coming to an end, the Panthers managed to tie the score. But then John Kasey booted the kickoff out of bounds, giving the Patriots the ball at their own 40-yard line, allowing Tom Brady to step in and win the game!</p>
<p>Do you think Kasey called it quits and retired because of one bad plan? NO!! He went on to play seven more seasons with the Panthers.</p>
<p>Whatever choices you made, do not replay your game-day decisions. You consumed it… MOVE ON!</p>
<p>And by move on, we DO NOT mean that you should attempt any kind of “damage control.” You can not and should not try to restrict calories or attempt to punish yourself in an attempt to “work off” the calories you consumed.</p>
<p>I mean, come on, what are you gonna do? Run 60 miles?? That is more than two back-to-back marathons, yet that is what it would take to even <em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">potentially</span></em> “burn” six thousand extra calories!</p>
<p>Don’t let your mind go there! It’s not healthy, and the outcome will BACKFIRE!</p>
<p>Even if you attempt to “work off” the calories consumed, all you will really do is stress out your body. This could wreak havoc on your hormones and hinder your body&#8217;s ability to recover properly. These things can actually stall weight-loss or even cause weight gain!</p>
<p>The best plan of action is to just <strong>GET BACK ON TRACK</strong>!</p>
<p>A great way to get back on track fast is with the help of Sculpt Nation’s fat-melting, muscle building supplements.</p>

<p>Did you know that all of the <em>POSITIVE</em> things you do to get your body in tip-top shape could be having a <em>NEGATIVE</em> impact on your overall health?</p>
<p>Don’t take this the wrong way. The health hazard we are about to tell you about happens to people of any age, weight, or fitness level! This is because the majority of what causes it is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">unavoidable</span>!</p>
<p>Losing fat, building lean muscle, killing it in the gym, and following a diet is GOOD. This information is far from your “get out of jail free card” to stop doing these things. However, what we are about to discuss may very well be THE REASON you aren’t seeing optimal results, despite your efforts!</p>
<p>You see, even GOOD things like diet and training could potentially backfire and create a BAD thing called OXIDATIVE STRESS. This type of stress happens when <em><strong>free radicals</strong></em> and antioxidants in your body are out of balance.</p>
<p>Since we are regularly exposed to <em><strong>free radicals</strong></em>, even if you never step on a treadmill, lift a weight, or follow a meal plan, you are still at high risk for this type of oxidative stress.</p>
<p>In fact, NOT exercising and eating nutritious food can also create a domino effect that could cause you to produce .. you guessed it .. excess free radicals!!</p>
<p><img class="size-large wp-image-6651" src="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/AdobeStock_295860038.jpeg?resize=1024%2C480&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="480" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/AdobeStock_295860038.jpeg?resize=1024%2C480&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/AdobeStock_295860038.jpeg?resize=300%2C141&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/AdobeStock_295860038.jpeg?resize=768%2C360&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/AdobeStock_295860038.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/AdobeStock_295860038.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><strong>What are <em>FREE RADICALS?</em></strong><br />
We won’t get into some boring chemistry lesson. All you need to know is that free radicals are unstable molecules, and too many of them can damage the cells in your body. Whatever organ a cell belongs to won’t function properly if this happens.</p>
<p>Our bodies are home to over <strong>37 trillion cells</strong> that control everything we do! The health of our cells dictates the appearance of our hair and skin, determines our mood, impacts the gut, regulates metabolism, etc. So you can see how an excess of free radicals could severely negatively impact you .. physically, mentally, and aesthetically!</p>
<p>Sometimes we are the ones responsible for creating this imbalance….</p>
<ul>
<li>Train too much = excess free radicals.</li>
<li>Don’t sleep enough = excess free radicals.</li>
<li>Have an overly restrictive diet and/or inadequate nutrition = excess free radicals.</li>
<li>Eat too many fried or processed foods = excess free radicals.</li>
<li>Stress/Anxiety = excess free radicals.</li>
<li>Smoking = excess free radicals.</li>
<li>Drinking too much alcohol = excess free radicals.</li>
<li>+MORE</li>
</ul>
<p>But there are other ways free radicals are produced in the body that we can’t avoid entirely&#8230;.</p>
<ul>
<li>Exposure to toxins/chemicals</li>
<li>Pesticides</li>
<li>Radiation</li>
<li>Pollutants</li>
<li>Solvents</li>
<li>Secondhand cigarette smoke</li>
<li>+MORE</li>
</ul>
<p>In short, whether you are in our control of them or not, when free radicals take over the body, cells become exhausted and STOP functioning properly.</p>
<p>Over time, what happens next is something called… <em><strong>CELLULAR BURNOUT!!</strong></em></p>
<p><img class="size-large wp-image-6649" src="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/AdobeStock_212626161.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/AdobeStock_212626161.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/AdobeStock_212626161.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/AdobeStock_212626161.jpeg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/AdobeStock_212626161.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/AdobeStock_212626161.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This creates a host of NEGATIVE side effects…..</p>
<ul>
<li>Fatigue</li>
<li>Lacking Endurance/Stamina</li>
<li>Bloating/Constipation</li>
<li>Low Sex Drive</li>
<li>Lackluster Skin</li>
<li>Brittle Hair &amp; Nails</li>
<li>Stalled Weight Loss</li>
<li>Fat Gain</li>
<li>Trouble Sleeping</li>
<li>Anxiety</li>
<li>Brain Fog</li>
<li>+ MUCH MORE</li>
</ul>
<p>You are probably experiencing many of these symptoms but have been unable to pinpoint the reason why. Now you know, it is most likely because of something you have likely never even heard of .. and that is <em><strong>CELLULAR BURNOUT!</strong></em></p>
<p>To make matters worse, as the body ages, it loses its ability to fight the effects of free radicals.</p>
<p><em><strong>The good news is that it’s not too late!</strong></em></p>
<p>You can fix CELLULAR BURNOUT by focusing on something called CELLULAR OPTIMIZATION.</p>
<p>Your body is a sum of its cells. This means that the healthier your cells are, the better you will look and feel. The problem is that you aren’t giving your cells what they need to be optimal.</p>
<p><img class="size-large wp-image-6652" src="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/AdobeStock_298726227.jpeg?resize=1024%2C768&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="768" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/AdobeStock_298726227.jpeg?resize=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/AdobeStock_298726227.jpeg?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/AdobeStock_298726227.jpeg?resize=768%2C576&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/AdobeStock_298726227.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/AdobeStock_298726227.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em><strong>How do we know this?</strong></em></p>
<p>Even the BEST DIET can not provide the fuel our cells need to THRIVE and cancel out all these excess free radicals. Add on all the stressors placed on your body (mentioned above), and a domino effect occurs until eventually your cells stop cooperating and TOTALLY BURNOUT!</p>
<p><strong>So how exactly can you OPTIMIZE the trillions of different cells in your body?</strong><br />
Simply put, you need to replace the BAD FUEL you are giving your cells (stress, processed foods, pollutants, etc.) with CLEAN FUEL (vitamins, minerals, antioxidants, etc.)</p>
<p><em><strong>You may be thinking…</strong></em><br />
<em>“Well, that is easy! I’ll just eat healthily, get enough sleep, and make sure I take a multivitamin.”</em></p>
<p><strong>Not so fast&#8230;</strong><br />
When it comes to CELLULAR BURNOUT, eating healthy, taking vitamins, and getting sleep, just won’t cut it!!</p>
<p>SCIENCE PROVES that our cells need VERY SPECIFIC superfoods in VERY SPECIFIC dosages to thrive.</p>
<p>This is exactly why our team at V Shred and Sculpt Nation has spent years, as well as hundreds of thousands of dollars, to come up with THE PERFECT SOLUTION to beat and treat cellular burnout!</p>
<p>This solution SHOULD cost you HUNDREDS of dollars every single month! We know that isn’t realistic, so we came up with a protocol that will cost you as little as just over ONE DOLLAR a day!</p>
<p><em><strong>WHAT IS IT?</strong></em><br />
It is actually TWENTY-SIX different ingredients including SEVEN SCIENTIFICALLY BACKED SUPERFOODS that studies prove can reverse cellular damage. The best part, you get all 26 of these ingredients perfectly dosed inside a single serving.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://sculptnation.com/greens-lp-v2"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Discover how to instantly hit the refresh button on your cellular health and finally get your life back!</span></a></p>
<p><a href="https://sculptnation.com/greens-lp-v2"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-6661 size-large" src="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Screenshot-2020-01-09-14.05.02.png?resize=1024%2C763&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="763" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Screenshot-2020-01-09-14.05.02.png?resize=1024%2C763&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Screenshot-2020-01-09-14.05.02.png?resize=300%2C223&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Screenshot-2020-01-09-14.05.02.png?resize=768%2C572&amp;ssl=1 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><em><strong>DO NOT DELAY!</strong></em> If you are already experiencing any of the symptoms we mentioned above, you are most likely already suffering from cellular burnout. You have to take action as soon as possible! The next fad diet, a multi-vitamin, and eating your fruits and veggies is NOT going to work!</p>

<p>‘Tis the season … that many people freak out about all the calories they are about to consume.</p>
<p>Understandably so! Temptations are everywhere this time of year!</p>
<ul>
<li>Your workplace probably has a new cookie delivery every day in December.</li>
<li>Your calendar is likely full of parties where high-calorie adult beverages and appetizers will be freely passed around.</li>
<li>You have at least one family feast to attend, if not several, all in one or two days.</li>
<li>You may be traveling with limited access to everything you (think) you need to stay on track with training.</li>
</ul>
<p>BUT .. you have a choice in how you approach the holidays.</p>
<p>You can CHOOSE to relax and enjoy yourself.<br />
<strong>OR</strong><br />
You can CHOOSE to be scared, stressed, and anxiety-filled.</p>
<p>All the things that make “dieting” hard, to begin with, will only be multiplied this month.<br />
But with a little planning and the right attitude, the holiday season is NOTHING to worry about.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong>8 Easy Tips For a Guilt-Free Holiday</strong></h3>
<p><strong>DO NOT STARVE YOURSELF&#8230;</strong><br />
If you go to a party or sit down at the holiday dinner table extremely hungry, you will no doubt overeat. Be mindful of what you eat leading into your holiday feast, but don’t go in starving. Unless you already incorporate dieting techniques such as Intermittent Fasting, if you are hungry before your feast, we do not suggest you skip meals.</p>
<p>Fill up on lean proteins and veggies, or enjoy a delicious <a href="https://sculptnation.com/product/protein/">Sculpt Nation protein shake using our top of the line Whey Protein Isolate!</a></p>
<p><a href="https://sculptnation.com/product/protein/"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-6613 size-large" src="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/PROTEIN-BLOG-FINAL.gif?resize=576%2C1024&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="576" height="1024" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/PROTEIN-BLOG-FINAL.gif?resize=576%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 576w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/PROTEIN-BLOG-FINAL.gif?resize=169%2C300&amp;ssl=1 169w" sizes="(max-width: 576px) 100vw, 576px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><strong>CHOOSE WISELY…</strong><br />
Just because it’s available does not mean you have to eat it. You should prioritize your favorite foods and only eat what you enjoy.</p>
<p>If you don’t love cranberry sauce, why eat it?<br />
If you have been craving your grandma’s stuffing all year, eat more of that!<br />
If you aren’t a big drinker, pass on the egg nog and have yourself a bigger slice of pie!<br />
Pile up on protein, but maybe go light on the gravy.</p>
<p>Also, remember that your eyes tend to be bigger than your stomach. Sometimes simply seeing or smelling all that delicious food will increase your appetite. <a href="https://sculptnation.com/product/burn-fat-burner/">Sculpt Nation BURN</a> would be a great product to implement. BURN is a cutting edge fat burner that contains a powerful appetite suppressant that can help hold back the desire to overfill your plate.</p>
<p><a href="https://sculptnation.com/product/burn-fat-burner/"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-6612 size-large" src="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/BURN-GIF-FINAL.gif?resize=576%2C1024&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="576" height="1024" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/BURN-GIF-FINAL.gif?resize=576%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 576w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/BURN-GIF-FINAL.gif?resize=169%2C300&amp;ssl=1 169w" sizes="(max-width: 576px) 100vw, 576px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><strong>BE MINDFUL…</strong><br />
When it’s time to dig in, start with smaller portions, and then eat slowly. If you think you want to go back for seconds <em>(or thirds)</em>, give yourself a break before filling your plate again.</p>
<p>Your hands are a great measuring tool if you want to ensure you don’t go overboard.</p>
<p><strong>Your clenched fist is about a cup…</strong> This measure is useful for side dishes.</p>
<p><strong>The palm of your hand is about 3 ounces of cooked meat…</strong> Use this as a guide for all that turkey and ham.</p>
<p><strong>Your thumb = about 1 tablespoon….</strong> This measure comes in handy when you’re trying to estimate things like dressings and gravy.</p>
<p><strong>MODIFY…</strong><br />
We are NOT suggesting that you ask your wife, mom, or grandma to change their family recipe. But there is nothing wrong with modifying the dish that you contribute.<br />
There are endless ways to make all your holiday favorites into lower-calorie options, especially for breakfast! Why not serve up some <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/pumpkin-spice-protein/">Sculpt Nation Protein Pancakes</a> instead of a high-calorie Christmas morning feast. With a little creativity, modifications are endless!</p>
<p><strong>JUST MOVE…</strong><br />
You may not be able to get in your usual lifts and cardio, but that doesn’t mean you can’t get in a good workout. At the very least, you can always go for a brisk walk or jog.</p>
<p>If time allows, our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCOFCwvhDoUvYcfpD7RJKQwA">YouTube Channel</a> has endless home workouts that take no equipment and only minutes of your day!</p>
<p>One thing we DO NOT want you to do is use verbiage like “earning” your dinner. Food is not some sort of reward and exercise should not be seen as punishment. Treat your holiday workout just like you would any other day of the year. Do it because you are ABLE and because it’s part of your lifestyle.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAK UP&#8230;</strong><br />
Do not be shy when it comes to telling people about your healthy lifestyle. Tell everyone about why it is important to you! It will hopefully keep them from guilting you into overeating or making comments about your choices. You never know, you may even motivate them to do the same. To help them get started and point them in the right direction. you can always encourage them to take our <a href="https://vshred.com/sp/survey/survey-aka1/">FREE body type quiz!</a></p>
<p><strong>STAY OFF THE SCALE…</strong><br />
While one meal, or even a few, will not wreck your progress, it most likely will have temporary effects on your weight. If you eat lots of food, all of that volume will be sitting in your stomach until it fully digests. The weight gain you see is not FAT GAIN. Most of what you see on the scale will be fluid retention. Not to mention other factors that can cause the scale to go up. Things like stress, lack of sleep, and even travel.</p>
<p>Holidays aside, remember that even on a typical day, weight can fluctuate several pounds. The holidays are no different. Take a scale break. Before you weigh yourself post-holiday, give your body at least 3-5 days to normalize.</p>
<p><strong>ENJOY EVERY BITE&#8230;</strong><br />
Worrying about weight gain is way more unhealthy than any temporary pounds you may (but most likely will not) pack on.</p>
<p>We aren’t saying that it is okay to “overindulge” just because it’s a holiday.<br />
We are saying that a few days of enjoying yourself WILL NOT derail your progress.</p>
<p>Stressing out over the holidays isn’t going to do anything except make you less likely to enjoy your time with friends and family. In fact, all that anxiety can backfire and be the reason you overeat. Having a preoccupation with food often causes people to go to ‘extremes’ and do things like binge-eat. Stress also raises your cortisol levels, which can lead to scale fluctuations and even excess fat storage.</p>
<p>If you have a problem controlling your anxiety, you may want to grab some <a href="https://sculptnation.com/product/neuroctane/">Sculpt Nation NEUROCTANE</a>. This product features adaptogens that naturally reduce stress and raise dopamine and serotonin levels. You will naturally feel more relaxed in those stress and anxiety-filled situations.</p>

<p><strong>REMEMBER&#8230;</strong> the holidays are about more than food. Shift your focus to making memories that don’t involve eating. Do not be so focused on food and weight gain that you miss out on what is important this Holiday season. You can’t redo life once it’s passed you by!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>From our V SHRED family to yours, we wish you a HAPPY (and stress-free) HOLIDAY.</strong></p>
