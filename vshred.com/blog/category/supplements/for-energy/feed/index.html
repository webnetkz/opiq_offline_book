That is a scary number!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Good thing you found this article because </span><b><i>we aren’t going to let YOU be “most” people! </i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lower temps do not have to equal larger waistlines! You just have to have a plan! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this short read we will &#8230;</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Explain why winter weight gain happens. Knowing why is important if you want to prevent it and the reason is probably not what you think. In fact, it is partially not even your fault!</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tell you why fall/winter is actually the BEST time to start a diet and training plan.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Give you 7 easy pro tips that will help guide you through the next few months. </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You may believe winter weight gain happens because of the holidays. Those extra home cooked meals and holiday parties are certainly a factor. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But </span><b><i>there is a DAILY issue you need to be prepared to fight </i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">if you want to avoid packing on winter pounds.</span></p>
<p><b>WHY YOU REALLY PACK ON POUNDS AFTER LABOR DAY</b></p>
<p><img class="size-large wp-image-7471" src="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_130930953.jpeg?resize=1024%2C512&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="512" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_130930953.jpeg?resize=1024%2C512&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_130930953.jpeg?resize=300%2C150&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_130930953.jpeg?resize=768%2C384&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_130930953.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_130930953.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the spring and summer months, you are given what we call a</span><b> fitness freebie. </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You get a </span><b><i>seasonal motivation boost</i></b> <span style="font-weight: 400;">that doesn’t happen when temperatures start to drop, and you begin to pull out the chunky sweaters and comfy leggings. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not only is the sun shining (which makes you happier because of Vitamin D), you are wearing LESS clothing in the summer months. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I don’t know about you, but knowing I’m going to be exposing more skin makes walking in the gym a little easier. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Covering up in layers, no doubt leads to the temptation to slack on body goals! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Knowing your arms, legs, and abs will be less exposed can easily be an excuse to slack. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, being layered up often means you don’t SEE the extra pounds, so they are easier to ignore.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But there is more to it than being bundled up….</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-7477" src="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_236518834.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_236518834.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_236518834.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_236518834.jpeg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_236518834.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_236518834.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span>The #1 reason you slack on health and fitness goals in colder months ISN’T EVEN YOUR FAULT!!</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, you have a part to play in all of this, but</span><b><i> there is actually a scientific reason why you have less desire to train and eat healthy when the sunshine of summer fades.</i></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We will explain why a little further down. But ya know what really stinks? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The scientific reason why we all experience these motivation slumps in the winter only adds to an even bigger issue with motivation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span>It doesn’t matter what season it is motivation ALWAYS comes and goes!</p>
<p>Spring, Summer, Fall, or Winter &#8211; you can NEVER rely on it!</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, what can you do when lack of sunshine and warm temps leave you even more tempted to hit snooze and reach for comfort foods? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You certainly don’t throw your hands up in the air and wait until January to make a resolution to crash diet to get your body ready for spring. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Believe it or not, RIGHT NOW is actually the IDEAL time to get started! </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you </span><b><i>START NOW, </i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">you will develop discipline and a routine heading into the holidays. This will put you in a great place mentally and physically to relax and “indulge” a little more at all those holiday gatherings! </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><b><i>Look at it this way ..<br />
</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Would you rather head into the holiday season already making progress toward your goals and be in a great spot <em>(where it would be okay even if you did gain an extra pound or two?)</em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Or would you rather put it off and only add more fat on top of what you want to lose?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The answer is clear— the solution to getting the motivation needed to make it happen, not so much.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But don’t worry! We’ve got ya covered</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (no pun intended)</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with a few easy motivation hacks!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><b>7 TIPS TO STAY MOTIVATED AS SEASONS CHANGE</b></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><b><br />
</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the number one questions we always get is … “<em>I am just not motivated. How can I motivate myself to train and eat better?”</em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As we mentioned earlier, it doesn&#8217;t matter what season it is, </span><b><i>you can’t always rely on motivation. </i></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you have it, great! You should certainly take advantage of it! But you have to know that it is totally normal to not have much of it. Even professional athletes lack motivation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You have to develop other daily habits that create discipline if you want to succeed long term!</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are a few of our pro tips that we use with our clients, specifically when temperatures drop, and motivation seems to be at its lowest! </span></p>
<p><b>TIP #1: Switch To An At Home Training Program</b></p>
<p><img class="size-large wp-image-7448" src="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_185038762.jpeg?resize=1024%2C647&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="647" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_185038762.jpeg?resize=1024%2C647&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_185038762.jpeg?resize=300%2C189&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_185038762.jpeg?resize=768%2C485&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_185038762.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_185038762.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you know that getting out of bed and stepping into the winter elements is going to be an excuse trigger, make a plan to train at home during cooler months! Some of the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">most effective and challenging workouts </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">only require your body weight and </span><b><i>maybe</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a set of dumbbells or some resistance bands.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A good fat-blasting, muscle-building sweat session can 100% be achieved from the comfort of your home!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adjustable dumbbells, ankle weights, resistance bands, a jump rope, etc., are all things that are inexpensive and can easily be stored in a closet or under your bed and pulled out anytime you don’t feel like leaving the house.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But if you have </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">the right training program</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><b><i>you don’t need any of that. </i></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our favorite </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">at-home bodyweight-only program</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is called</span><b> MOVE. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was designed to help you achieve your fitness goals without a single piece of equipment, and each workout is under 20 minutes! </span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Learn more about MOVE by watching the video below!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you need </span><b>a little extra “nudge”</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to get up and get moving, another </span><b>pro-tip we use</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is keeping some </span><a href="https://sculptnation.com/products/pre-workout" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><b>PRE WORKOUT </b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">on your bedside table. Have it already blended up and chug it as soon as your alarm goes off!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By the time you have brushed your teeth and put on your workout clothes, you will have a nice little jolt of energy and</span><b><i> tons of motivation</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to get going before you have a chance to come up with an excuse! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the bottom of this article, we will tell you about a big end of summer sale happening so that you can stock up on our </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">favorite </span><a href="https://sculptnation.com/products/pre-workout" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><b>PRE WORKOUT</b></a><strong> for 40% off when you use code: LABORDAY40 at checkout! </strong></p>
<p><b>TIP #2: Make Your Workouts Seasonal</b></p>
<p><img class="size-large wp-image-7452" src="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_65703942.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_65703942.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_65703942.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_65703942.jpeg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_65703942.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_65703942.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Embrace the change of seasons and take advantage of activities that you can only do in fall or winter! </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Go on a fall hike and view all the gorgeous foliage.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Try rock climbing.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Walk around a corn maze or pumpkin patch with your family. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you live in a snowy climate, go skiing, sledding, build snowmen with your kids, etc.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Go ice skating.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lace-up your sneakers, go for a walk or run at night, and admire all the Christmas lights and decorations.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are some things you can only do and see during specific times of the year. So instead of missing sunshine and water sports, focus on all the positive things that only come about with cooler temps!</span></p>
<p><b>TIP #3: Try Something Totally New</b></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-7454" src="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_361152601.jpeg?resize=1024%2C514&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="514" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_361152601.jpeg?resize=1024%2C514&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_361152601.jpeg?resize=300%2C151&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_361152601.jpeg?resize=768%2C386&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_361152601.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_361152601.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sometimes a change of routine is all you need to boost motivation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you have been doing all your gym lifts alone, recruit a gym buddy! Try switching up your cardio by skipping your solo runs and joining a group fitness class instead. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another option is to </span><b><i>allow yourself to slow down!</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> If you have been crushing it all spring and summer with intense training and hardcore workouts, </span><b><i>it may actually be time to take it down a notch. </i></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Going full force 365 can cause your stress hormone cortisol to increase. This can lead to a host of drawbacks, including weight gain, muscle loss, poor moods, fatigue, and occasional issues sleeping! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We aren’t saying you should become lazy! But if you have been crushing it 24/7 all spring and summer, your body (and mind) may need to slow down.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Use the next few months to embrace a slower routine. </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Commit to daily yoga.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Focus on becoming more flexible.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Switch to low or moderate-intensity cardio, instead of HIIT.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Try out some bodyweight workouts instead of heavy lifting.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Giving your body a couple of months to recover might even make you more responsive when you decide to kick things up again come spring/summer!</span></p>
<p><b>TIP #4: Stay Accountable</b></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-7457" src="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_266584820.jpeg?resize=1024%2C768&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="768" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_266584820.jpeg?resize=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_266584820.jpeg?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_266584820.jpeg?resize=768%2C576&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_266584820.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_266584820.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><b><br />
</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">The best way to stick to a plan is to have someone that you report back to. This could be a friend, family member, a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">social media community</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, or even a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">coach. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Including someone else, or even just telling someone else about your health and fitness goals and asking them to check in with you to make sure you are sticking to the plan, is a great way to keep the promises you make to yourself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you prefer to fly solo, it helps to create visuals. Make a vision board, create a daily checklist you can mark off after each workout, or keep an accomplishment journal.</span></p>
<p><b>TIP #5: Set A Spring Goal</b></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-7458" src="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_47332240.jpeg?resize=1024%2C680&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="680" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_47332240.jpeg?resize=1024%2C680&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_47332240.jpeg?resize=300%2C199&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_47332240.jpeg?resize=768%2C510&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_47332240.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_47332240.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">March may seem like a long time away, but it will be back before you know it, and 6 months is a long time to make significant changes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Setting a goal is a great way to encourage yourself to push past discomforts and temptation, but there is a science to goal setting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The key to creating goals that stick .. </span><b><i>be REALISTIC and SPECIFIC!</i></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s start with </span><b><i>reality. </i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">You should always focus on one goal at a time and make sure you are being honest with yourself if that goal is really attainable.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you know that your schedule will never allow you to work out 6 days a week, why would you choose a program that requires you to do that?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you know it’s not healthy to attempt to lose 10 pounds a week, why would you aim that high?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you love carbs, why would you go on a KETO diet? </span></p>
<p><b><i>Doing these things will essentially set yourself up for failure.</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Set attainable goals that fit YOUR lifestyle. You can always bump things up if your schedule allows, or you notice you aren’t pushing yourself hard enough. Just keep in mind that being realistic isn’t the same as not believing in yourself or making excuses. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moving on to being </span><b><i>specific.</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The more specific you are about your goals, the more likely you will be to reach them. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It may seem like it’s good enough to say things like .. I want to look good, lose weight, or get ripped! </span><b><i>But you have to dig deeper than that!! </i></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wanting to “lose weight,” for example, is an excellent place to start. But ask yourself what that means to you?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you expand on that and say &#8212; “I want to lose 10 pounds of fat. I will do this by not eating any sweets and doing the V Shred </span><a href="https://vshred.com/sp/move/soc-all/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><b>MOVE </b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">program for 30 consecutive days. I am doing this because I want to have better self-esteem and a head start on bikini season.” &#8212; that makes your goal more specific.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The more specific (and attainable) your goals are, the more likely you will be to not give up!</span></p>
<p><b>TIP #6: Reward Yourself</b></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-7459" src="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/vin_sant_32048508_366936073798151_433609263865135104_n.jpg?resize=882%2C1024&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="882" height="1024" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/vin_sant_32048508_366936073798151_433609263865135104_n.jpg?resize=882%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 882w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/vin_sant_32048508_366936073798151_433609263865135104_n.jpg?resize=258%2C300&amp;ssl=1 258w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/vin_sant_32048508_366936073798151_433609263865135104_n.jpg?resize=768%2C892&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/vin_sant_32048508_366936073798151_433609263865135104_n.jpg?w=1080&amp;ssl=1 1080w" sizes="(max-width: 882px) 100vw, 882px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you have checked a “mini goal” off your list, treat yourself. Knowing that you have a reward coming to celebrate your efforts will make you want to achieve it even more. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It may be tempting to make your reward one of your favorite “forbidden foods” but we never suggest that you reward yourself this way.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You aren’t a dog. You should never reward “good behavior” with food. Having this mentality can create a really unhealthy relationship with food.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You need to eat healthy MOST of the time, control your portions, and see food as fuel. But if you are craving something that isn’t quite as healthy as your grilled chicken and rice, never feel like you need to lose 20 pounds to “deserve” a bite of cake, or nice dinner out with your family. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instead of rewarding yourself with food, buy yourself something you have been wanting. Maybe some new workout clothes, a massage, or an extra $20 bucks in your vacation fund! </span></p>

<p><b>TIP #7: Make Mental Health Top Priority</b></p>
<p><img class="size-large wp-image-7460" src="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_255894146.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_255894146.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_255894146.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_255894146.jpeg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_255894146.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_255894146.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Earlier, we mentioned that cold weather motivation dips may not be your fault.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’m sure you have heard of winter blues. Well, it’s a real thing. Less natural light can cause dips in serotonin, the neurotransmitter that regulates mood.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The dark and dreary days of winter can also cause your body to produce more of the sleep hormone melatonin. This shift can disrupt your body and impact your sleep patterns and overall mood.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are a few ways that you can focus on improving your mental health.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Invest in a light therapy box that simulates natural daylight.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Make sure you are supplementing with or eating plenty of foods with Vitamin D.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Start journaling. There is a lot of scientific evidence that supports putting your thoughts on paper provides a long list of benefits, including stress management, self-confidence, and goal setting. </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Suppose you still find yourself struggling with negative seasonal motivation shifts. In that case, you may need to experiment with taking</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> naturally sourced herbs</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to help support brain health and a positive mood.</span></p>
<p><b><i>Here are a few with some great scientific backing to help boost mood.</i></b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>EnXtra: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">A natural caffeine-free patent-pending botanical ingredient that has been shown to help increase dopamine levels.**It is also one of the first and only natural caffeine-free patent-pending botanical ingredients shown to boost mental alertness &amp; acuity for hours or ending in a huge caffeine energy crash.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Piper Nigrum Fruit Extract:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> A very specific type of black pepper that has been shown to help increase both serotonin and dopamine.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>L-Theanine:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> A powerful amino acid that is believed to help reduce occasional anxiety brought on by stressful situations.</span></li>
</ul>

<p><b><i>BOTTOM LINE IF YOU WANT TO STAY MOTIVATED YEAR ROUND</i></b><b><i><br />
</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you put away the shorts and swimsuits and shift out of bikini season, it’s common for motivation to “fall back” with the clocks. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The seasons have to change (unless you live near the equator) &#8211; so you have to figure out ways to</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">not let your fitness goals go into hibernation mode!</span><b><i> </i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pumpkin spice lattes are only here for a limited time, but getting into shape isn’t seasonal! </span><i>It&#8217;s a year-round commitment!!</i><i> </i></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Is Your Gut Bacteria Balanced?</strong><br />
<strong>If not, that explains a lot <em>(maybe even your weight gain)</em></strong></p>
<p><em><strong>“What is on the inside will be reflected on the outside.”</strong></em> &#8212; Don’t worry, we aren’t about to give you a Ted Talk about the importance of inner beauty (but that is important too)</p>
<p>We are about to tell you how VITAL it is that you invest in GUT HEALTH so your body can be healthy enough inside to build muscle and burn fat … <em><strong>and look the way you want it to on the outside.</strong></em></p>
<p>We’ve got a <em><strong>gut instinct</strong></em> that most of you have at least one of the following issues.</p>
<ul>
<li>Occasional Bloating</li>
<li>Occasional Gas</li>
<li>Occasional Constipation</li>
<li>Occasional Diarrhea</li>
<li>Brain Fog</li>
<li>Unrestful Sleep</li>
<li>Exhaustion</li>
<li>A sluggish immune system</li>
<li>Difficulty losing weight</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: center;">We also have a <em><strong>gut feeling</strong></em> as to why.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-6894 size-full" src="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/AdobeStock_140658974.jpeg?resize=1170%2C780&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1170" height="780" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/AdobeStock_140658974.jpeg?w=5760&amp;ssl=1 5760w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/AdobeStock_140658974.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/AdobeStock_140658974.jpeg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/AdobeStock_140658974.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/AdobeStock_140658974.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/AdobeStock_140658974.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1170px) 100vw, 1170px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>Actually… WE KNOW WHY!</p>
<p>Because science tells us that these things could all be happening because… <em><strong>your gut isn’t healthy!</strong></em></p>
<p>You probably already know that an unhealthy gut can be the cause of GI distress.<br />
<em><strong>But the guts connection to WEIGHT LOSS and YOUR IMMUNE SYSTEM</strong></em>…. Might be something you have never considered!</p>
<p><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>In this article, we will explain:</strong></span></em></p>
<ul>
<li>How probiotics can help you lose weight!</li>
<li>How probiotics boost immunity!</li>
<li>How to get your gut health back with probiotics (and what they are.)</li>
<li>The best probiotics strains for whole-body health (and the problem with most on store shelves.)</li>
<li>The OTHER “biotic” your body needs for probiotics to do their job.</li>
</ul>
<p>Before we dive into <em><strong>how your gut could be hindering your ability to lose weight…</strong></em><br />
we need to talk about HOW to get your gut in a balanced and healthy state.</p>
<p>The best way to ensure your gut is happy (and as a result, helps your entire body function properly) is to feed it with&#8230;<em><strong> the right balance of GOOD bacteria.</strong></em></p>
<p>Over 100 trillion microorganisms live in your body. Your gut has been taken over by much of this bacteria since birth.</p>
<p>Bacteria isn’t always a “bad word”.. your gut needs certain types of bacteria to have optimal digestion, healthy immune system function, and a strong metabolism.</p>
<p><em><strong>It becomes “bad” when harmful bacteria take over.</strong></em></p>
<p>Our intestines are under constant attack. A diet lacking diversity and essential micronutrients, stress, toxins in our environment, genetics, and aging, can all cause BAD bacteria to populate.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>You have to balance this out with GOOD bacteria!</strong></em></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-6885 size-full" src="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/AdobeStock_312008058.jpeg?resize=1170%2C752&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1170" height="752" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/AdobeStock_312008058.jpeg?w=4200&amp;ssl=1 4200w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/AdobeStock_312008058.jpeg?resize=300%2C193&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/AdobeStock_312008058.jpeg?resize=768%2C494&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/AdobeStock_312008058.jpeg?resize=1024%2C658&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/AdobeStock_312008058.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/AdobeStock_312008058.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1170px) 100vw, 1170px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><em><strong>Here is how you do that….</strong></em><br />
The best way to support gut health and fight the imbalances that may cause GI issues (and possibly weight gain), is to improve your nutrition and create healthy lifestyle habits.</p>
<p>Exercise .. that’s easy enough.<br />
Nutrition … that’s where things get tricky.</p>
<p>To balance out gut bacteria, you need to figure out how to eat a bunch of food that contains <em><strong>a perfect mix of VERY specific probiotics and prebiotics.</strong></em></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>For reference….</strong></span><br />
<em>Probiotics</em> … are live bacteria. It’s the food your gut likes and needs to stay healthy.<br />
<em>Prebiotics</em> … feed this good bacteria. Think of them as “fertilizer” for probiotics.</p>
<p>Here is a glance at a few of the things you would need to eat (daily) to feed your gut with enough prebiotics and probiotics to make your gut flora balanced, healthy, and happy.</p>
<ul>
<li>Lots of raw/organic veggies and fruits</li>
<li>Some nuts and beans.</li>
<li>Fiber sources such as flax and chia seeds.</li>
<li>A few fermented foods like kimchi, sauerkraut, yogurt, or unpasteurized cheese.</li>
<li>Some foods like coconut, ginger, and olive oil.</li>
</ul>
<p>Are you REALLY going to eat THAT MUCH VARIETY every single day? And can you imagine how expensive it would be to purchase QUALITY foods like this in high amounts?</p>
<p>Wouldn’t it be much easier to take one capsule with meals and know you are giving your gut exactly what it needs to thrive (and set you up for your weight loss goals.)</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>Exactly why we developed <a href="https://sculptnation.com/products/probiotics">Sculpt Nation Probiotics</a>!</strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://sculptnation.com/products/probiotics"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6921" src="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/ezgif-2-bc5238f7a928.gif?resize=600%2C600&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="600" height="600" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

<strong>Today only! <a href="https://sculptnation.com/products/probiotics">==&gt; CLICK HERE</a></strong></p>
<p>For years, we have been studying all of the latest research on gut health. Before we released a Probiotic, we wanted to make sure it was only the best on the market.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>Mission accomplished &#8211; <a href="https://sculptnation.com/products/probiotics">Sculpt Nation Probiotics</a> are now available!</strong></em></p>
<p>We know that there are THOUSANDS of probiotics on store shelves. You are probably asking yourself what makes ours any different?</p>
<p><em><strong>Here are a few problems with most probiotics….</strong></em></p>
<ul>
<li>Most are nothing more than tablets filled with only a few (if any) LIVE and ACTIVE probiotics.</li>
<li>They do not contain the RIGHT BLEND of bacteria.</li>
<li>Most generic probiotics products starve your beneficial bacteria because they don’t include PREbiotics.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>We wanted to take out all of the confusion.</strong></p>
<p>Rather than spending countless hours asking Google, or scanning every store shelf totally overwhelmed with all of the options,<em><strong> we developed the most powerful and complete blend of “gut food” that money can buy!</strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><em><strong>Here is a breakdown of what every <a href="https://sculptnation.com/products/probiotics">Sculpt Nation PROBIOTICS </a>serving contains.</strong></em></p>
<p>Let’s start with the ingredient most probiotics on the market DO NOT HAVE… but should!</p>
<p>It’s not a Probiotic.<br />
It is a PRE-biotic.</p>
<p><em><strong>We briefly touched on this earlier but to re-cap…</strong></em>PREbiotics are different than PRObiotics.</p>
<p>PREbiotics are not bacteria. They are a special type of fiber that feeds your good bacteria.</p>
<p>Most of the fiber you eat from your diet is not this type of special type of fiber; one reason why supplementing with it is important!</p>
<p>The prebiotic we choose to put in our <a href="https://sculptnation.com/products/probiotics">Sculpt Nation Probiotic Blend</a> is called INULIN <em>(a unique type of prebiotic fiber found in plants.)</em></p>
<p>Look at prebiotics and probiotics as a team. Probiotics need food to work. That food is prebiotics. <em><strong>You shouldn’t be supplementing with one… and not the other.</strong></em></p>
<p><a href="https://sculptnation.com/products/probiotics"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6916" src="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Probiotics.png?resize=800%2C828&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="800" height="828" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Probiotics.png?w=800&amp;ssl=1 800w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Probiotics.png?resize=290%2C300&amp;ssl=1 290w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Probiotics.png?resize=768%2C795&amp;ssl=1 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><em><strong>Okay, now let’s move on to the 7 LIVE PROBIOTICS in our unique PROBIOTICS blend.</strong></em></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Bacillus Coagulans</strong> &#8211; Shown to help support protein absorption and recovery from exercise. This results in reduced muscle damage and soreness. Other studies show it helps reduce occasional bloating.</li>
<li><strong>Lactobacillus Acidophilus</strong> &#8211; This is one of the strongest, most researched, and most well-known probiotics. Studies rave about its ability to help promote better digestive health, support regularity and strengthen immune system function.</li>
<li><strong>Bifidobacterium Bifidum</strong> &#8211; This is an important one because it makes up around 80% of your intestinal microflora. Studies show it can help with occasional stress, increase levels of good bacteria in the gut, and act as an antioxidant.</li>
<li><strong>Bifidobacterium Longum</strong> &#8211; This one can also combat stress, as well as help support learning, boost memory, and improve mood.</li>
<li><strong>Strepococcus Thermophilius</strong> &#8211; Shown to help support a healthy immune system, promote oral health, and the overall composition of your gut’s microflora.</li>
<li><strong>Lactobacillus Bulgaricus (Delbrueckii)</strong> &#8211; Another research-backed and very powerful immune system booster.</li>
<li><strong>Lactobacillus Paracasei</strong> &#8211; Can support the strength of your intestinal barrier, aid in nutrient absorption, and help with immune system health.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Now that you understand HOW TO FEED YOUR GUT </strong><em><strong>(and what makes <a href="https://sculptnation.com/products/probiotics">OUR BLEND</a> unique)</strong></em><br />
<strong>Let’s go over how PROBIOTICS may help you lose weight!</strong></p>
<p><img class="size-large wp-image-6914" src="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/AdobeStock_314724372.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/AdobeStock_314724372.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/AdobeStock_314724372.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/AdobeStock_314724372.jpeg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/AdobeStock_314724372.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/AdobeStock_314724372.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>Numerous studies have found that overweight people have different gut bacteria than either normal-weight or skinny people.<br />
We could stop here, and you would probably be sold on the fact that <em><strong>a healthy gut can NO DOUBT can have an impact on your weight.</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>But let’s keep going&#8230;</strong></em><br />
Researchers have conducted studies where they transplanted gut bacteria from obese mice into the guts of lean mice&#8230;and the lean mice got fat!!</p>
<p><em><strong>Crazy, right?!</strong></em></p>
<p>Studies like this make it pretty evident that gut bacteria play a significant role in weight regulation.</p>
<p><em><strong>But how?!</strong></em></p>
<ul>
<li>Probiotics may help release a hormone in your body that tells you you are full. Higher levels of this appetite-reducing hormone (GLP-1) also help you burn more fat.</li>
<li>Probiotics may support improved fat metabolism by encouraging an increase in levels of a protein called ANGPTL4 (a circulating protein involved in the regulation of fatty acid metabolism.)</li>
<li>Probiotics may support a healthy, normal inflammatory response, which can contribute to weight issues.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Probiotics can play a POWERFUL role in weight management</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Plus… let’s not forget the many other reasons to take a probiotic supplement… like improved GI health, energy balance, emotional support, optimal brain health, and immune support.<br />
But they are not magic pills.</p>
<p><strong>Probiotics &amp; Your Immune System</strong><br />
70-80% of immune cells live in your gut. It makes perfect sense that if your gut isn’t healthy, your immune system won’t be either!</p>
<p>We’ve already told you the numerous ways probiotics strengthen your gut. Because of that you are already helping support the strength of your immune system. This is especially important for immune support because the intestinal lining contains specialized cells to maintain health during times of challenge.</p>
<p>Beyond that, quality probiotics have also been demonstrated to support immunity by boosting immune cells and increasing key immune-boosting antibodies.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>Probiotics are not magic pills.</strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">They are just one tool in your arsenal for creating a healthier you.<br />
You need to combine supplements with a healthy diet and regular training program to get the best results.<br />
Nutrients that give you the energy to work out are crucial. Eat a blend of lean proteins, healthy fats, vitamin-rich fruits, and vegetables (or a powdered supplement like <strong><a href="https://sculptnation.com/products/greens">THESE</a></strong>.)</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Meal prepping helps you stay committed to a good diet.</p>
<p>Let me show you how to do it</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Here are seven ways how <a href="https://sculptnation.com/product/neuroctane/">NeurOctane</a> and a youthful brain can help you maximize the results from your workout sessions.</p>
<h2>NeurOctane | 7 Reasons Athletes Need Brain Supplements</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>1. Protects Your Brain From Dangerous Radicals</h3>
<p>Taking the best brain supplements such as <a href="https://sculptnation.com/product/neuroctane/">NeurOctane</a> is important to shield ourselves from brain-damaging free-radicals. These compounds are the leading cause of brain degeneration.</p>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> Apart from taking brain vitamins, fitness buffs should supplement with antioxidants as well. Doing so will detox the brain and body leading to better athletic performance.</p>
<p><strong>Free-Radicals:</strong> Dangerous compounds that negatively affect our physical, mental, and emotional health.</p>
<h3>2. Naturally Raises Dopamine and Serotonin Levels</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-5796 size-full" src="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Horizontal-photo-of-attractive-woman-jogging-on-treadmill-at-health-club-neuroctane-ss.jpg?resize=625%2C400&#038;ssl=1" alt="Naturally Raises Dopamine and Serotonin Levels | Reasons Why Your Brain Needs A Boost When You’re Working Out" width="625" height="400" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Horizontal-photo-of-attractive-woman-jogging-on-treadmill-at-health-club-neuroctane-ss.jpg?w=625&amp;ssl=1 625w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Horizontal-photo-of-attractive-woman-jogging-on-treadmill-at-health-club-neuroctane-ss.jpg?resize=300%2C192&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>Keeping a healthy level of serotonin is important to ensure proper body functions. These affect the way our muscles, digestive tract, and cardiovascular system work.</p>
<p><a href="https://sculptnation.com/product/neuroctane/">NeurOctane</a> is one of the best natural stimulants to promote dopamine and serotonin production in the body. A good level of these chemicals will improve the way our mind and body communicate with each other.</p>
<p>Apart from improving overall strength and function, these brain pills also have a positive effect on our mood. With that, athletes can show up at the gym feeling refreshed and motivated no matter what day of the week it is.</p>
<p><strong>Dopamine:</strong> It’s a compound the body naturally produces when we’re feeling happy. High levels of dopamine also improve our cognitive and motor skills. It may lead to better physical, emotional, and mental capabilities.</p>
<p><strong>Serotonin:</strong> This chemical is vital to maintain and improve brain function. It’s responsible for relaying messages from one part of the brain to another.</p>
<h3>3. Boost Your Information Retention</h3>
<p>If you’ve ever had difficulty memorizing multiple chunks of information, then you might need a brain boost. <a href="https://sculptnation.com/product/neuroctane/">NeurOctane</a> is a brain supplement that improves the mind’s ability to retain information.</p>
<p>Whether it’s a new workout routine or important details at work, brain boosters will help you remember them. Try taking <a href="https://sculptnation.com/product/neuroctane/">NeurOctane</a> to improve your short-term memory.</p>
<h3>4. Improve Your Memory</h3>
<p>Long-term memory is just as important as short-term information retention. A poor memory may be the sign of brain degeneration.</p>
<p>As we grow older, both the mind and body need more supplements to maintain peak performance. If you don’t have a healthy mind, how can you expect to be at your absolute best at the gym?</p>
<h3>5. Fight Anxiety and Improve Mood</h3>
<p>Mental health issues such as anxiety and depression can be really troublesome, especially if you can’t pinpoint the reason why you’re feeling down.</p>
<p>However, like any other disease, these all start from our own mind and body. Imbalanced hormone levels generally cause these issues.</p>
<p>Luckily, taking vitamins for the brain may help maintain a healthy balance in the chemicals and hormones in your body. Try taking brain booster supps that increase dopamine and serotonin. These may help alleviate anxiety and depression.</p>
<p><strong>Important:</strong> Mental health problems should never be taken lightly. The best way to conquer them is to start by <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/running-benefits/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cleansing your mind and body</a>.</p>
<p>If you have a toxic body brimming with <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/healthy-eating-mistakes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">unhealthy junk</a>, then your mind will fill itself with negativity as well. Exercising not only leads to a better-looking body, but it also helps promote a healthy mind.</p>
<h3>6. Rapidly Relieve Stress</h3>
<p>We may not realize it, but stress can negatively affect the way we look, think, and perform. Think about it, all your best workout sessions happened because you were having a good day.</p>
<p>On the other hand, working out with a preoccupied mind might even lead to injuries. Start taking brain enhancement supps today to relieve and remedy stress.</p>
<p>Plus, a stressed-out mind produces cortisol, testosterone-sapping hormones. If you want to achieve a lean, fit body, then you need to maintain a healthy level of testosterone.</p>
<p>Using brain health supplements is exactly what we need to relax.</p>
<h3>7. Improve Focus and Alertness</h3>
<p><!-- instagram error: invalid instagram resource --></p>
<p>A top-performing body stems from a focused mind. Taking focus pills is a surefire way to enhance mind IQ and give your body the power it needs to beat your last PR.</p>
<h3>What Ingredients to Look for in Focus Supplements</h3>
<p>Here are some of the ingredients your brain supplement should have:</p>
<h3><strong>1. Bacopa Monnieri</strong></h3>
<p>It’s an amazing neurotropic that helps you dramatically lower your stress levels, alleviate anxiety, and support a positive mood.</p>
<p>At the same time, bacopa monnieri also helps promote normal inflammatory responses and improve both memory and brain function by removing free-radicals in your brain.</p>
<h3><strong>2. EnXtra (Alpinia Galanga Extract)</strong></h3>
<p>It’s an amazing plant extract that acts as a 100% stimulant-free brain supplement. It rapidly increases mental alertness, focus, and energy.</p>
<p>Human studies in the BAOJ Nutrition Journal showed that EnXtra can boost mental alertness and acuity for up to five hours without increasing blood pressure or heart rate. Also, unlike stimulants, this brain boost ingredient does not end in a huge energy crash.</p>
<h3><strong>3. NOOPEPT (N-Phenylacetyl-L-Prolyglycine Ethyl Ester)</strong></h3>
<p>Studies on animals show that this powerful compound can raise the brain’s NGF and BDNF levels. They are both important compounds to improve cognitive function, information retention, and long-term memory recall.</p>
<p><strong>Neurotrophic Growth Factor (NGF): </strong>They play an important role in the regulation of growth, development, maintenance, and division of specific target neurons.</p>
<p><strong>Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF):</strong> These support existing neurons while promoting the growth and production of new neurons and synapses.</p>
<h3><strong>4. Piper Nigrum Fruit Extract 95%</strong></h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-5798 size-full" src="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Black-Pepper-neuroctane-ss.jpg?resize=625%2C400&#038;ssl=1" alt="Piper Nigrum Fruit Extract 95% | Reasons Why Your Brain Needs A Boost When You’re Working Out" width="625" height="400" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Black-Pepper-neuroctane-ss.jpg?w=625&amp;ssl=1 625w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Black-Pepper-neuroctane-ss.jpg?resize=300%2C192&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>This ingredient supports the effectiveness of nootropics in the brain while serving the function of one as well. It acts as an MAO inhibitor to increase your dopamine and serotonin levels.</p>
<p>Also, it’s a potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory supplement that can protect your brain from certain diseases.</p>
<h3><strong>5. L-Theanine</strong></h3>
<p>Hyper-powerful amino acids that can help fight anxiety, relieve stress, increase focus, and improve sleep quality. Studies also show that combining L-theanine with coffee enhances its energizing effects while removing the jitters.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Pre-workout supplements are popular amongst those active in and outside of gyms. For those looking for an extra pump or added energy to get through a workout, there are a variety of different pre-workout supplements available.</p>
<h2>Why Pre-Workout Supplements Matter</h2>
<h3>Which Pre-workout Supplement is Best to Use?</h3>
<p>While everyone has their own opinion and personal review of the many different brands on the market, the most important part of deciding which one is for you is to take notice of how the supplement affects you. I get asked regularly which pre-workout is the best to use, and my answer is always <strong>whichever one works best for the individual</strong>.</p>
<p>I’ve heard a number of different experiences from people who all take the same kind of pre-workout from:</p>
<ul>
<li>“It didn’t do anything for me.” – I’ve had some that didn’t make any noticeable changes to my routine.</li>
<li>“I couldn’t sleep after I took it.” – I’ve had some that seemed to keep up alert all day, and others that gave me a really ‘relaxed’ crash about 2.5 hours after I took it.</li>
<li>“I had the best workout of my life.”</li>
</ul>
<h3><b>Another Common Question I get Asked Is, “Do Pre-Workouts Actually Work?”</b></h3>
<p>My belief is that yes, they do. I do, however, believe that a piece of the supplement actually working is a psychological aspect – the placebo effect – if you believe it’s going to help, it probably will.</p>
<h3>What&#8217;s in a Pre-Workout Supplement?</h3>
<p>Most pre-workouts contain <strong>caffeine</strong>, which is a known stimulant and energy booster. <strong>Beta-alanine</strong>, another common ingredient, is usually the ingredient that makes you flush and perhaps feel “itchy.”</p>
<p><strong>Creatine</strong>, which many pre-workouts contain, has also been demonstrated in some studies to provide extra energy creation in the body to push through an intense workout session. That said, creatine requires regular use to allow the body to create more energy, so if a pre-workout supplement is used infrequently, there’s a probability that the creatine in the supplement isn’t doing anything extraordinary during a bout of exercise.</p>
<h3>When Should I Take Pre-Workout?</h3>
<p><!-- instagram error: invalid instagram resource --></p>
<p>While pre-workouts can be useful, particularly if you’re lacking energy on a particular day, cautionary actions should be taken when using them.</p>
<p><strong> First, make sure you’re healthy enough to be taking the supplement.</strong> Consult with your doctor if you’ve had liver or heart problems or if you have a family history of liver or heart problems.</p>
<p><strong>Secondly, adhere to the recommended dosage/serving when using pre-workouts.</strong> I’ve had individuals approach me and tell me that they exceeded the dosage because they thought it would give them an even better workout, and then ended up in the hospital with heart palpitations.</p>
<p><strong>More is not better in this scenario.</strong> Also, follow the directions with respect to not exceeding the allotted time of use. Generally, most recommend not using the supplement for more than 4 weeks without a 2-week break from it. The body can and will build a tolerance to pre-workout for most people.</p>

<h3>How To Start Taking Pre-Workout Supplements</h3>
<p>If you’ve never used a pre-workout, are healthy enough to do so, and want to try using them, my advice is to get some single-serving samples of a few different pre-workouts and test them out. Make a mental (or physical) note of how your energy, focus, and overall well-being was during your workout with each respective use of pre-workouts. This will allow you to make the best decision about which one works best for you.</p>

<p>Taking a pre-workout supplement is a beneficial way to amp up your workout regime by giving you energy and focus to get the best workout possible each and every time. Be smart and listen to your body, and take as advised above.</p>

<h2>Fat Burner FAQs For Fitness Buffs</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
