That is a scary number!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Good thing you found this article because </span><b><i>we aren’t going to let YOU be “most” people! </i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lower temps do not have to equal larger waistlines! You just have to have a plan! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this short read we will &#8230;</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Explain why winter weight gain happens. Knowing why is important if you want to prevent it and the reason is probably not what you think. In fact, it is partially not even your fault!</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tell you why fall/winter is actually the BEST time to start a diet and training plan.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Give you 7 easy pro tips that will help guide you through the next few months. </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You may believe winter weight gain happens because of the holidays. Those extra home cooked meals and holiday parties are certainly a factor. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But </span><b><i>there is a DAILY issue you need to be prepared to fight </i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">if you want to avoid packing on winter pounds.</span></p>
<p><b>WHY YOU REALLY PACK ON POUNDS AFTER LABOR DAY</b></p>
<p><img class="size-large wp-image-7471" src="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_130930953.jpeg?resize=1024%2C512&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="512" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_130930953.jpeg?resize=1024%2C512&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_130930953.jpeg?resize=300%2C150&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_130930953.jpeg?resize=768%2C384&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_130930953.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_130930953.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the spring and summer months, you are given what we call a</span><b> fitness freebie. </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You get a </span><b><i>seasonal motivation boost</i></b> <span style="font-weight: 400;">that doesn’t happen when temperatures start to drop, and you begin to pull out the chunky sweaters and comfy leggings. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not only is the sun shining (which makes you happier because of Vitamin D), you are wearing LESS clothing in the summer months. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I don’t know about you, but knowing I’m going to be exposing more skin makes walking in the gym a little easier. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Covering up in layers, no doubt leads to the temptation to slack on body goals! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Knowing your arms, legs, and abs will be less exposed can easily be an excuse to slack. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, being layered up often means you don’t SEE the extra pounds, so they are easier to ignore.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But there is more to it than being bundled up….</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-7477" src="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_236518834.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_236518834.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_236518834.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_236518834.jpeg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_236518834.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_236518834.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span>The #1 reason you slack on health and fitness goals in colder months ISN’T EVEN YOUR FAULT!!</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, you have a part to play in all of this, but</span><b><i> there is actually a scientific reason why you have less desire to train and eat healthy when the sunshine of summer fades.</i></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We will explain why a little further down. But ya know what really stinks? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The scientific reason why we all experience these motivation slumps in the winter only adds to an even bigger issue with motivation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span>It doesn’t matter what season it is motivation ALWAYS comes and goes!</p>
<p>Spring, Summer, Fall, or Winter &#8211; you can NEVER rely on it!</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, what can you do when lack of sunshine and warm temps leave you even more tempted to hit snooze and reach for comfort foods? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You certainly don’t throw your hands up in the air and wait until January to make a resolution to crash diet to get your body ready for spring. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Believe it or not, RIGHT NOW is actually the IDEAL time to get started! </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you </span><b><i>START NOW, </i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">you will develop discipline and a routine heading into the holidays. This will put you in a great place mentally and physically to relax and “indulge” a little more at all those holiday gatherings! </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><b><i>Look at it this way ..<br />
</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Would you rather head into the holiday season already making progress toward your goals and be in a great spot <em>(where it would be okay even if you did gain an extra pound or two?)</em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Or would you rather put it off and only add more fat on top of what you want to lose?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The answer is clear— the solution to getting the motivation needed to make it happen, not so much.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But don’t worry! We’ve got ya covered</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (no pun intended)</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with a few easy motivation hacks!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><b>7 TIPS TO STAY MOTIVATED AS SEASONS CHANGE</b></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><b><br />
</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the number one questions we always get is … “<em>I am just not motivated. How can I motivate myself to train and eat better?”</em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As we mentioned earlier, it doesn&#8217;t matter what season it is, </span><b><i>you can’t always rely on motivation. </i></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you have it, great! You should certainly take advantage of it! But you have to know that it is totally normal to not have much of it. Even professional athletes lack motivation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You have to develop other daily habits that create discipline if you want to succeed long term!</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are a few of our pro tips that we use with our clients, specifically when temperatures drop, and motivation seems to be at its lowest! </span></p>
<p><b>TIP #1: Switch To An At Home Training Program</b></p>
<p><img class="size-large wp-image-7448" src="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_185038762.jpeg?resize=1024%2C647&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="647" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_185038762.jpeg?resize=1024%2C647&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_185038762.jpeg?resize=300%2C189&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_185038762.jpeg?resize=768%2C485&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_185038762.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_185038762.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you know that getting out of bed and stepping into the winter elements is going to be an excuse trigger, make a plan to train at home during cooler months! Some of the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">most effective and challenging workouts </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">only require your body weight and </span><b><i>maybe</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a set of dumbbells or some resistance bands.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A good fat-blasting, muscle-building sweat session can 100% be achieved from the comfort of your home!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adjustable dumbbells, ankle weights, resistance bands, a jump rope, etc., are all things that are inexpensive and can easily be stored in a closet or under your bed and pulled out anytime you don’t feel like leaving the house.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But if you have </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">the right training program</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><b><i>you don’t need any of that. </i></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our favorite </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">at-home bodyweight-only program</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is called</span><b> MOVE. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was designed to help you achieve your fitness goals without a single piece of equipment, and each workout is under 20 minutes! </span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Learn more about MOVE by watching the video below!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you need </span><b>a little extra “nudge”</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to get up and get moving, another </span><b>pro-tip we use</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is keeping some </span><a href="https://sculptnation.com/products/pre-workout" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><b>PRE WORKOUT </b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">on your bedside table. Have it already blended up and chug it as soon as your alarm goes off!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By the time you have brushed your teeth and put on your workout clothes, you will have a nice little jolt of energy and</span><b><i> tons of motivation</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to get going before you have a chance to come up with an excuse! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the bottom of this article, we will tell you about a big end of summer sale happening so that you can stock up on our </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">favorite </span><a href="https://sculptnation.com/products/pre-workout" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><b>PRE WORKOUT</b></a><strong> for 40% off when you use code: LABORDAY40 at checkout! </strong></p>
<p><b>TIP #2: Make Your Workouts Seasonal</b></p>
<p><img class="size-large wp-image-7452" src="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_65703942.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_65703942.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_65703942.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_65703942.jpeg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_65703942.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_65703942.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Embrace the change of seasons and take advantage of activities that you can only do in fall or winter! </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Go on a fall hike and view all the gorgeous foliage.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Try rock climbing.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Walk around a corn maze or pumpkin patch with your family. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you live in a snowy climate, go skiing, sledding, build snowmen with your kids, etc.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Go ice skating.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lace-up your sneakers, go for a walk or run at night, and admire all the Christmas lights and decorations.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are some things you can only do and see during specific times of the year. So instead of missing sunshine and water sports, focus on all the positive things that only come about with cooler temps!</span></p>
<p><b>TIP #3: Try Something Totally New</b></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-7454" src="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_361152601.jpeg?resize=1024%2C514&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="514" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_361152601.jpeg?resize=1024%2C514&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_361152601.jpeg?resize=300%2C151&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_361152601.jpeg?resize=768%2C386&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_361152601.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_361152601.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sometimes a change of routine is all you need to boost motivation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you have been doing all your gym lifts alone, recruit a gym buddy! Try switching up your cardio by skipping your solo runs and joining a group fitness class instead. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another option is to </span><b><i>allow yourself to slow down!</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> If you have been crushing it all spring and summer with intense training and hardcore workouts, </span><b><i>it may actually be time to take it down a notch. </i></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Going full force 365 can cause your stress hormone cortisol to increase. This can lead to a host of drawbacks, including weight gain, muscle loss, poor moods, fatigue, and occasional issues sleeping! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We aren’t saying you should become lazy! But if you have been crushing it 24/7 all spring and summer, your body (and mind) may need to slow down.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Use the next few months to embrace a slower routine. </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Commit to daily yoga.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Focus on becoming more flexible.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Switch to low or moderate-intensity cardio, instead of HIIT.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Try out some bodyweight workouts instead of heavy lifting.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Giving your body a couple of months to recover might even make you more responsive when you decide to kick things up again come spring/summer!</span></p>
<p><b>TIP #4: Stay Accountable</b></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-7457" src="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_266584820.jpeg?resize=1024%2C768&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="768" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_266584820.jpeg?resize=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_266584820.jpeg?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_266584820.jpeg?resize=768%2C576&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_266584820.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_266584820.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><b><br />
</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">The best way to stick to a plan is to have someone that you report back to. This could be a friend, family member, a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">social media community</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, or even a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">coach. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Including someone else, or even just telling someone else about your health and fitness goals and asking them to check in with you to make sure you are sticking to the plan, is a great way to keep the promises you make to yourself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you prefer to fly solo, it helps to create visuals. Make a vision board, create a daily checklist you can mark off after each workout, or keep an accomplishment journal.</span></p>
<p><b>TIP #5: Set A Spring Goal</b></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-7458" src="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_47332240.jpeg?resize=1024%2C680&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="680" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_47332240.jpeg?resize=1024%2C680&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_47332240.jpeg?resize=300%2C199&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_47332240.jpeg?resize=768%2C510&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_47332240.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_47332240.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">March may seem like a long time away, but it will be back before you know it, and 6 months is a long time to make significant changes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Setting a goal is a great way to encourage yourself to push past discomforts and temptation, but there is a science to goal setting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The key to creating goals that stick .. </span><b><i>be REALISTIC and SPECIFIC!</i></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s start with </span><b><i>reality. </i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">You should always focus on one goal at a time and make sure you are being honest with yourself if that goal is really attainable.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you know that your schedule will never allow you to work out 6 days a week, why would you choose a program that requires you to do that?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you know it’s not healthy to attempt to lose 10 pounds a week, why would you aim that high?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you love carbs, why would you go on a KETO diet? </span></p>
<p><b><i>Doing these things will essentially set yourself up for failure.</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Set attainable goals that fit YOUR lifestyle. You can always bump things up if your schedule allows, or you notice you aren’t pushing yourself hard enough. Just keep in mind that being realistic isn’t the same as not believing in yourself or making excuses. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moving on to being </span><b><i>specific.</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The more specific you are about your goals, the more likely you will be to reach them. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It may seem like it’s good enough to say things like .. I want to look good, lose weight, or get ripped! </span><b><i>But you have to dig deeper than that!! </i></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wanting to “lose weight,” for example, is an excellent place to start. But ask yourself what that means to you?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you expand on that and say &#8212; “I want to lose 10 pounds of fat. I will do this by not eating any sweets and doing the V Shred </span><a href="https://vshred.com/sp/move/soc-all/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><b>MOVE </b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">program for 30 consecutive days. I am doing this because I want to have better self-esteem and a head start on bikini season.” &#8212; that makes your goal more specific.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The more specific (and attainable) your goals are, the more likely you will be to not give up!</span></p>
<p><b>TIP #6: Reward Yourself</b></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-7459" src="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/vin_sant_32048508_366936073798151_433609263865135104_n.jpg?resize=882%2C1024&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="882" height="1024" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/vin_sant_32048508_366936073798151_433609263865135104_n.jpg?resize=882%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 882w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/vin_sant_32048508_366936073798151_433609263865135104_n.jpg?resize=258%2C300&amp;ssl=1 258w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/vin_sant_32048508_366936073798151_433609263865135104_n.jpg?resize=768%2C892&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/vin_sant_32048508_366936073798151_433609263865135104_n.jpg?w=1080&amp;ssl=1 1080w" sizes="(max-width: 882px) 100vw, 882px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you have checked a “mini goal” off your list, treat yourself. Knowing that you have a reward coming to celebrate your efforts will make you want to achieve it even more. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It may be tempting to make your reward one of your favorite “forbidden foods” but we never suggest that you reward yourself this way.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You aren’t a dog. You should never reward “good behavior” with food. Having this mentality can create a really unhealthy relationship with food.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You need to eat healthy MOST of the time, control your portions, and see food as fuel. But if you are craving something that isn’t quite as healthy as your grilled chicken and rice, never feel like you need to lose 20 pounds to “deserve” a bite of cake, or nice dinner out with your family. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instead of rewarding yourself with food, buy yourself something you have been wanting. Maybe some new workout clothes, a massage, or an extra $20 bucks in your vacation fund! </span></p>

<p><b>TIP #7: Make Mental Health Top Priority</b></p>
<p><img class="size-large wp-image-7460" src="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_255894146.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_255894146.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_255894146.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_255894146.jpeg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_255894146.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_255894146.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Earlier, we mentioned that cold weather motivation dips may not be your fault.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’m sure you have heard of winter blues. Well, it’s a real thing. Less natural light can cause dips in serotonin, the neurotransmitter that regulates mood.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The dark and dreary days of winter can also cause your body to produce more of the sleep hormone melatonin. This shift can disrupt your body and impact your sleep patterns and overall mood.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are a few ways that you can focus on improving your mental health.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Invest in a light therapy box that simulates natural daylight.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Make sure you are supplementing with or eating plenty of foods with Vitamin D.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Start journaling. There is a lot of scientific evidence that supports putting your thoughts on paper provides a long list of benefits, including stress management, self-confidence, and goal setting. </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Suppose you still find yourself struggling with negative seasonal motivation shifts. In that case, you may need to experiment with taking</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> naturally sourced herbs</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to help support brain health and a positive mood.</span></p>
<p><b><i>Here are a few with some great scientific backing to help boost mood.</i></b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>EnXtra: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">A natural caffeine-free patent-pending botanical ingredient that has been shown to help increase dopamine levels.**It is also one of the first and only natural caffeine-free patent-pending botanical ingredients shown to boost mental alertness &amp; acuity for hours or ending in a huge caffeine energy crash.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Piper Nigrum Fruit Extract:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> A very specific type of black pepper that has been shown to help increase both serotonin and dopamine.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>L-Theanine:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> A powerful amino acid that is believed to help reduce occasional anxiety brought on by stressful situations.</span></li>
</ul>

<p><b><i>BOTTOM LINE IF YOU WANT TO STAY MOTIVATED YEAR ROUND</i></b><b><i><br />
</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you put away the shorts and swimsuits and shift out of bikini season, it’s common for motivation to “fall back” with the clocks. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The seasons have to change (unless you live near the equator) &#8211; so you have to figure out ways to</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">not let your fitness goals go into hibernation mode!</span><b><i> </i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pumpkin spice lattes are only here for a limited time, but getting into shape isn’t seasonal! </span><i>It&#8217;s a year-round commitment!!</i><i> </i></p>

<h3><strong>Symptoms of Low HGH Levels</strong></h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-6034" src="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/AdobeStock_84767772.jpeg.crdownload.jpeg?resize=700%2C498&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="700" height="498" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/AdobeStock_84767772.jpeg.crdownload.jpeg?resize=1024%2C729&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/AdobeStock_84767772.jpeg.crdownload.jpeg?resize=300%2C214&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/AdobeStock_84767772.jpeg.crdownload.jpeg?resize=768%2C547&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/AdobeStock_84767772.jpeg.crdownload.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/AdobeStock_84767772.jpeg.crdownload.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Low Growth Hormone levels make It virtually impossible for you to burn fat, build muscle, and have your dream body. Here&#8217;s a list of low HGH symptoms to look out for:</p>
<h3>1. Unexplained Increases in Belly Fat</h3>
<p>If you&#8217;re eating clean and continue to gain belly fat, there&#8217;s a chance your growth hormone levels are too low. HGH levels help burn belly fat. When your HGH levels are low you can still see an increase in belly fat even when you are eating clean.</p>
<h3>2. Strength Loss</h3>
<p>Despite training hard, low HGH levels can result in loss of strength. This makes your efforts at the gym worthless.</p>
<h3>3. Decreases Sexual Performance</h3>
<p>Growth hormone levels tied to sexual performance and even loss of libido. Boosting your HGH levels helps improve your sexual performance..</p>
<h3>4. Shortened Stamina</h3>
<p>Feeling like <span>you’ve never before needed this many breaks while working out? </span>Shortened stamina can be a symptom of low HGH levels. If you’re needing longer rest times while working out, you may be suffering from HGH deficiency.</p>
<h3>5. Mood Changes</h3>
<p>Human growth hormones also play a role in regulating other hormones in your body. Without enough HGH, you may suffer from chronic mood swings and<span> feel down, even when things are going well</span></p>
<h3>6. Hair Loss</h3>
<p>HGH is important for the development and growth of hair. Hair loss or thinning can be signs of low HGH levels.</p>
<h3>7. Dwindling Muscle Mass</h3>
<p>Another symptom of low HGH levels is<span> losing mass even though you’re going hard in the gym</span> despite <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/workout-routine-pro/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">regular physical exercise</a>.</p>
<h3>8. Trouble Recovering from Your Workouts</h3>
<p>Growth hormones help your body recover after any physical activity. If <span>you’re feeling fatigued no matter how much you sleep, and you have lingering muscle soreness you may have low HGH levels</span></p>

<p>Not all HGH supplements are the same. You have to look for supplements that include the following ingredients to increase your growth hormone levels.</p>
<h3>1. Arginine</h3>
<p>Arginine has been shown to lead to <u>significant increases</u> in serum growth hormone levels in just 90-minutes</p>
<h3>2. Amino Acid Complex</h3>

<h3>3. L-Lysine</h3>
<p>L-lysine is another type of amino acid that&#8217;s essential for growth and tissue repair. Improved levels of L-lysine in the body can help reduce anxiety and fight hair loss plus it&#8217;s a major force in HGH production and muscle growth</p>
<h3>4. Leucine and L-Ornithine</h3>
<p><span>Leucine and L-Ornithine provide a power-packed 1-2 punch for improving and speeding-up fat loss.</span></p>
<h3>5. Glycine</h3>
<p><span>Human and animal studies show that Glycine helps boost your mental &amp; physical energy, protects your joints’ cartilage, and enhances your physical performance</span>. It can also increase energy and <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/neuroctane-brain-performance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">mental capability</a> to help you perform better in and out of the gym.</p>
<h3>6. GABA</h3>
<p><span>GABA, a neurotransmitter, helps you fall into a deep, Cortisol-crushing sleep. Plus, researchers found that GABA helps increase your HGH both post-workout and specifically while you sleep.</span></p>
<h3>7. Colostrum</h3>
<p><span>Colostrum is another ingredient in HGH Boost that helps deliver a fast natural spike in HGH and IGF-1 levels. Studies show that after 8-weeks of Colostrum supplementation, your peak anaerobic power as well as serum growth hormone levels.</span></p>

<h2>7 Test-Boost Ingredients Your Supplement Should Have</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>1. Tribulus Terrestris</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-5704 size-full" src="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Seeds-of-Tribulus-terrestris-plant-test-boost-ss.jpg?resize=625%2C400&#038;ssl=1" alt="Tribulus Terrestris | Must-Haves In Your Testosterone Supplement" width="625" height="400" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Seeds-of-Tribulus-terrestris-plant-test-boost-ss.jpg?w=625&amp;ssl=1 625w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Seeds-of-Tribulus-terrestris-plant-test-boost-ss.jpg?resize=300%2C192&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>The tribulus terrestris is a Mediterranean plant people use for its array of health and aesthetic benefits. Users take it for sports, bodybuilding, and even disease prevention, among others.</p>

<p>It’s the best testosterone booster to help you <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/best-way-to-burn-fat-and-build-muscle-reset-your-hormones-naturally/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">increase strength gains and get over plateaus</a>. That way, you can increase your size without sacrificing lean muscle mass.</p>

<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-5708 size-full" src="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Roots-and-powder-of-Ashwagandha-also-known-as-Indian-ginseng-test-boost-ss.jpg?resize=625%2C400&#038;ssl=1" alt="Ashwaganda Root 4:1 Extract | Must-Haves In Your Testosterone Supplement" width="625" height="400" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Roots-and-powder-of-Ashwagandha-also-known-as-Indian-ginseng-test-boost-ss.jpg?w=625&amp;ssl=1 625w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Roots-and-powder-of-Ashwagandha-also-known-as-Indian-ginseng-test-boost-ss.jpg?resize=300%2C192&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>Taking the best <a href="https://sculptnation.com/product/test-boost/">testosterone supplements</a> is useless if you’re constantly under a lot of stress. You may not know it, but stress actually decreases the amount of testosterone in your body.</p>
<p>When you’re under stress, the body produces cortisol, a testosterone-sapping hormone. Luckily, Ashwaganda root is a testosterone booster that decreases the amount of cortisol the body has.</p>
<p>As a result, users can enjoy an increase in both strength and muscle mass. In fact, one study showed that Ashwaganda roots helped their subjects lift heavier on the bench press while adding mass in the triceps, biceps, and forearms.</p>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> To decrease cortisol levels, remember to take a breather every now and then. Stress negatively affects the way our mind and body performs.</p>
<h3>5. Hawthorn Berry Extract (Crategus Leavigata)</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-5709 size-full" src="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Medical-folk-remedies-from-the-fruits-of-hawthorn-test-boost-ss.jpg?resize=625%2C400&#038;ssl=1" alt="Hawthorn Berry Extract (Crategus Leavigata) | Must-Haves In Your Testosterone Supplement" width="625" height="400" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Medical-folk-remedies-from-the-fruits-of-hawthorn-test-boost-ss.jpg?w=625&amp;ssl=1 625w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Medical-folk-remedies-from-the-fruits-of-hawthorn-test-boost-ss.jpg?resize=300%2C192&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>

<h2>7 Things to Look Out for When Choosing Your Protein Powder</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>1. 90% Whey Protein for Superior Absorption</h3>
<p>When choosing your <a href="https://sculptnation.com/product/protein-chocolate/">protein supplement</a>, go with the one that best supports protein absorption. Choosing supplements with low-protein absorption won’t give you the results you want.</p>
<p>Make sure to grab the ones made of pure protein. Protein powder shouldn&#8217;t contain any unnecessary fillers or calories the body will only store as fat.</p>
<p>On the other hand, fast-reacting <a href="https://sculptnation.com/product/protein-vanilla/">protein supplements</a> can stimulate the body’s anabolic system. This type of whey protein is important to incorporate into your post-workout routine to maximize the anabolic window.</p>
<p><strong>Anabolic Window</strong>: The anabolic window is the 30-minute time frame after a workout where the body shifts from a catabolic state to an anabolic one. During this window, the muscle needs as many nutrients as possible to recover properly.</p>
<h3>2. Fast-Acting BCAAs</h3>
<p><!-- instagram error: invalid instagram resource --></p>
<p><a href="https://sculptnation.com/product/bcaas/">BCAAs</a> are three of the nine essential amino acids that make up about 35% of our body’s muscle mass. The main role of BCAAs is to support muscle recovery and prevent muscle breakdown simultaneously.</p>
<p>As a gym-goer, taking protein powder supplements with fast-acting BCAAs allows you to recover from an intense gym day faster than you would without taking it.</p>
<p>Plus, BCAAs decrease the chances of your body burning protein. Instead, they feed the protein directly to your muscles.</p>
<p>It’s best to take BCAA-filled protein powder supplements after your workout, on recovery days, and calorie-restricted time frames.</p>
<p><strong>BCAAs:</strong> The acronym stands for Branch-Chained Amino Acids. You can take them as a <a href="https://sculptnation.com/product/bcaas/">standalone supplement</a> or use <a href="https://sculptnation.com/product/protein-chocolate/">protein supplements that utilize them</a>.</p>
<h3>3. High Bioavailability</h3>
<p>When it comes to whey protein, every second counts. As we said, the body needs to absorb the nutrients within 30 minutes of finishing a workout.</p>
<p>That’s why gym-goers should only choose protein supplements with a high bioavailability rate. Every single gram of protein, carbs, and other nutrients should go directly to your body.</p>
<p>The body only benefits from your supplement’s nutrients if it successfully absorbs them. Otherwise, it’ll just leave you bloated and gassy with zero results.</p>
<p><strong>Bioavailability:</strong> It is the portion of a supplement, drug, or any substance that allows the components to successfully enter the body’s circulation.</p>
<h3>4. Meal Replacement</h3>
<p>When dieting, the goal is to eat fewer calories throughout the day. Sadly, most low-calorie foods don’t give us the energy we need to last extended hours without food.</p>
<p>To counter this, many gym-goers count on food supplements to get longer-lasting energy. But the question is: what food supplement can we use as a meal replacement?</p>
<p>Keep in mind that not every protein powder supplement out there is a suitable meal replacement. Most of them don’t have enough fast-acting protein and amino acids for gym-goers to source their energy from.</p>
<p>That’s why you need to use a whey protein supplement that provides an array of nutrients the body can absorb and convert to energy. As opposed to solely relying on food, using whey protein may help you lose weight faster without sacrificing lean muscle mass.</p>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> Feel free to pair this supplement with some high-protein foods to maximize the results from your<a href="https://vshred.com/blog/high-protein-diet-plans/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> protein diet plan</a> for weight-loss or<a href="https://vshred.com/blog/how-to-gain-muscle-mass/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> muscle gain</a>.</p>
<h3>5. Non-GMO</h3>
<p>Before taking any type of supplement, make sure the label says its all-natural and non-GMO. Consuming artificially sourced supplements may lead to health complications.</p>
<p>Apart from delaying the gains, your body might react negatively if you consume too much of a GMO. Plus, creating GMO&#8217;s is not only a health hazard, but it’s also a threat to the environment.</p>
<p><strong>GMO:</strong> The abbreviation GMO stands for genetically modified organism. Researchers and scientists create this as a cheaper alternative to many organic ingredients.</p>
<h3>6. Leucine</h3>
<p><!-- instagram error: invalid instagram resource --></p>
<p>Protein supplements will only be effective if you combine them with the right amino acids. Of the nine essential amino acids, leucine plays one of the most important roles.</p>
<p>In fact, leucine is responsible for activating the protein compounds. It’s the amino which allows the body to reap the full benefits of a protein powder supplement.</p>
<p>Plus, it can also lower the body’s blood sugar by releasing insulin from the pancreas. This is good news for fitness buffs who struggle with high blood sugar.</p>
<p>That’s why when choosing your protein supplement, make sure to go with one that has a good amount of amino acids such as leucine.</p>
<h3>7. Taste</h3>
<p>Let’s face it: everybody hates foul-tasting protein powder. You shouldn’t force yourself to stomach a whole bottle of a protein shake that tastes like rotten fruit and smells like rotten cheese &#8211;even if it has insane amounts of protein.</p>
<p>That’s why you should only use easy-to-mix, delicious protein powder supplements. You’re making enough sacrifices as it is. There’s no need to down protein shakes that taste terrible.</p>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> Drinking the same protein shake every day can get boring. To prevent this, try some delicious, exciting <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/healthy-protein-shake-recipes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">protein shake recipes</a> every now and then.</p>
<p>It’s a great way to spice up your post-workout routine. Plus, it’ll give you something new to look forward to after an intense training session.</p>

<p>Overall, these are the top seven things you need to keep an eye out for when buying your protein supplements. Make sure you only purchase the brand that checks all of these boxes.</p>
<p>If you want to maximize the benefits of whey protein, you need to combine it with regular exercise and healthy dieting. Create a body-specific fitness plan that aligns with your lifestyle, goals, and needs then stick to it. No excuses!</p>
