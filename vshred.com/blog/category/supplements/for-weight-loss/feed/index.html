That is a scary number!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Good thing you found this article because </span><b><i>we aren’t going to let YOU be “most” people! </i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lower temps do not have to equal larger waistlines! You just have to have a plan! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this short read we will &#8230;</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Explain why winter weight gain happens. Knowing why is important if you want to prevent it and the reason is probably not what you think. In fact, it is partially not even your fault!</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tell you why fall/winter is actually the BEST time to start a diet and training plan.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Give you 7 easy pro tips that will help guide you through the next few months. </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You may believe winter weight gain happens because of the holidays. Those extra home cooked meals and holiday parties are certainly a factor. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But </span><b><i>there is a DAILY issue you need to be prepared to fight </i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">if you want to avoid packing on winter pounds.</span></p>
<p><b>WHY YOU REALLY PACK ON POUNDS AFTER LABOR DAY</b></p>
<p><img class="size-large wp-image-7471" src="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_130930953.jpeg?resize=1024%2C512&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="512" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_130930953.jpeg?resize=1024%2C512&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_130930953.jpeg?resize=300%2C150&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_130930953.jpeg?resize=768%2C384&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_130930953.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_130930953.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the spring and summer months, you are given what we call a</span><b> fitness freebie. </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You get a </span><b><i>seasonal motivation boost</i></b> <span style="font-weight: 400;">that doesn’t happen when temperatures start to drop, and you begin to pull out the chunky sweaters and comfy leggings. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not only is the sun shining (which makes you happier because of Vitamin D), you are wearing LESS clothing in the summer months. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I don’t know about you, but knowing I’m going to be exposing more skin makes walking in the gym a little easier. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Covering up in layers, no doubt leads to the temptation to slack on body goals! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Knowing your arms, legs, and abs will be less exposed can easily be an excuse to slack. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, being layered up often means you don’t SEE the extra pounds, so they are easier to ignore.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But there is more to it than being bundled up….</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-7477" src="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_236518834.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_236518834.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_236518834.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_236518834.jpeg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_236518834.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_236518834.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span>The #1 reason you slack on health and fitness goals in colder months ISN’T EVEN YOUR FAULT!!</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, you have a part to play in all of this, but</span><b><i> there is actually a scientific reason why you have less desire to train and eat healthy when the sunshine of summer fades.</i></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We will explain why a little further down. But ya know what really stinks? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The scientific reason why we all experience these motivation slumps in the winter only adds to an even bigger issue with motivation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span>It doesn’t matter what season it is motivation ALWAYS comes and goes!</p>
<p>Spring, Summer, Fall, or Winter &#8211; you can NEVER rely on it!</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, what can you do when lack of sunshine and warm temps leave you even more tempted to hit snooze and reach for comfort foods? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You certainly don’t throw your hands up in the air and wait until January to make a resolution to crash diet to get your body ready for spring. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Believe it or not, RIGHT NOW is actually the IDEAL time to get started! </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you </span><b><i>START NOW, </i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">you will develop discipline and a routine heading into the holidays. This will put you in a great place mentally and physically to relax and “indulge” a little more at all those holiday gatherings! </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><b><i>Look at it this way ..<br />
</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Would you rather head into the holiday season already making progress toward your goals and be in a great spot <em>(where it would be okay even if you did gain an extra pound or two?)</em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Or would you rather put it off and only add more fat on top of what you want to lose?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The answer is clear— the solution to getting the motivation needed to make it happen, not so much.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But don’t worry! We’ve got ya covered</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (no pun intended)</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with a few easy motivation hacks!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><b>7 TIPS TO STAY MOTIVATED AS SEASONS CHANGE</b></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><b><br />
</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the number one questions we always get is … “<em>I am just not motivated. How can I motivate myself to train and eat better?”</em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As we mentioned earlier, it doesn&#8217;t matter what season it is, </span><b><i>you can’t always rely on motivation. </i></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you have it, great! You should certainly take advantage of it! But you have to know that it is totally normal to not have much of it. Even professional athletes lack motivation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You have to develop other daily habits that create discipline if you want to succeed long term!</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are a few of our pro tips that we use with our clients, specifically when temperatures drop, and motivation seems to be at its lowest! </span></p>
<p><b>TIP #1: Switch To An At Home Training Program</b></p>
<p><img class="size-large wp-image-7448" src="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_185038762.jpeg?resize=1024%2C647&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="647" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_185038762.jpeg?resize=1024%2C647&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_185038762.jpeg?resize=300%2C189&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_185038762.jpeg?resize=768%2C485&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_185038762.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_185038762.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you know that getting out of bed and stepping into the winter elements is going to be an excuse trigger, make a plan to train at home during cooler months! Some of the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">most effective and challenging workouts </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">only require your body weight and </span><b><i>maybe</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a set of dumbbells or some resistance bands.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A good fat-blasting, muscle-building sweat session can 100% be achieved from the comfort of your home!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adjustable dumbbells, ankle weights, resistance bands, a jump rope, etc., are all things that are inexpensive and can easily be stored in a closet or under your bed and pulled out anytime you don’t feel like leaving the house.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But if you have </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">the right training program</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><b><i>you don’t need any of that. </i></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our favorite </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">at-home bodyweight-only program</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is called</span><b> MOVE. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was designed to help you achieve your fitness goals without a single piece of equipment, and each workout is under 20 minutes! </span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Learn more about MOVE by watching the video below!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you need </span><b>a little extra “nudge”</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to get up and get moving, another </span><b>pro-tip we use</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is keeping some </span><a href="https://sculptnation.com/products/pre-workout" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><b>PRE WORKOUT </b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">on your bedside table. Have it already blended up and chug it as soon as your alarm goes off!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By the time you have brushed your teeth and put on your workout clothes, you will have a nice little jolt of energy and</span><b><i> tons of motivation</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to get going before you have a chance to come up with an excuse! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the bottom of this article, we will tell you about a big end of summer sale happening so that you can stock up on our </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">favorite </span><a href="https://sculptnation.com/products/pre-workout" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><b>PRE WORKOUT</b></a><strong> for 40% off when you use code: LABORDAY40 at checkout! </strong></p>
<p><b>TIP #2: Make Your Workouts Seasonal</b></p>
<p><img class="size-large wp-image-7452" src="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_65703942.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_65703942.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_65703942.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_65703942.jpeg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_65703942.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_65703942.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Embrace the change of seasons and take advantage of activities that you can only do in fall or winter! </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Go on a fall hike and view all the gorgeous foliage.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Try rock climbing.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Walk around a corn maze or pumpkin patch with your family. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you live in a snowy climate, go skiing, sledding, build snowmen with your kids, etc.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Go ice skating.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lace-up your sneakers, go for a walk or run at night, and admire all the Christmas lights and decorations.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are some things you can only do and see during specific times of the year. So instead of missing sunshine and water sports, focus on all the positive things that only come about with cooler temps!</span></p>
<p><b>TIP #3: Try Something Totally New</b></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-7454" src="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_361152601.jpeg?resize=1024%2C514&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="514" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_361152601.jpeg?resize=1024%2C514&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_361152601.jpeg?resize=300%2C151&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_361152601.jpeg?resize=768%2C386&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_361152601.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_361152601.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sometimes a change of routine is all you need to boost motivation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you have been doing all your gym lifts alone, recruit a gym buddy! Try switching up your cardio by skipping your solo runs and joining a group fitness class instead. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another option is to </span><b><i>allow yourself to slow down!</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> If you have been crushing it all spring and summer with intense training and hardcore workouts, </span><b><i>it may actually be time to take it down a notch. </i></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Going full force 365 can cause your stress hormone cortisol to increase. This can lead to a host of drawbacks, including weight gain, muscle loss, poor moods, fatigue, and occasional issues sleeping! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We aren’t saying you should become lazy! But if you have been crushing it 24/7 all spring and summer, your body (and mind) may need to slow down.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Use the next few months to embrace a slower routine. </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Commit to daily yoga.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Focus on becoming more flexible.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Switch to low or moderate-intensity cardio, instead of HIIT.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Try out some bodyweight workouts instead of heavy lifting.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Giving your body a couple of months to recover might even make you more responsive when you decide to kick things up again come spring/summer!</span></p>
<p><b>TIP #4: Stay Accountable</b></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-7457" src="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_266584820.jpeg?resize=1024%2C768&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="768" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_266584820.jpeg?resize=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_266584820.jpeg?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_266584820.jpeg?resize=768%2C576&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_266584820.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_266584820.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><b><br />
</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">The best way to stick to a plan is to have someone that you report back to. This could be a friend, family member, a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">social media community</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, or even a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">coach. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Including someone else, or even just telling someone else about your health and fitness goals and asking them to check in with you to make sure you are sticking to the plan, is a great way to keep the promises you make to yourself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you prefer to fly solo, it helps to create visuals. Make a vision board, create a daily checklist you can mark off after each workout, or keep an accomplishment journal.</span></p>
<p><b>TIP #5: Set A Spring Goal</b></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-7458" src="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_47332240.jpeg?resize=1024%2C680&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="680" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_47332240.jpeg?resize=1024%2C680&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_47332240.jpeg?resize=300%2C199&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_47332240.jpeg?resize=768%2C510&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_47332240.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_47332240.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">March may seem like a long time away, but it will be back before you know it, and 6 months is a long time to make significant changes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Setting a goal is a great way to encourage yourself to push past discomforts and temptation, but there is a science to goal setting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The key to creating goals that stick .. </span><b><i>be REALISTIC and SPECIFIC!</i></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s start with </span><b><i>reality. </i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">You should always focus on one goal at a time and make sure you are being honest with yourself if that goal is really attainable.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you know that your schedule will never allow you to work out 6 days a week, why would you choose a program that requires you to do that?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you know it’s not healthy to attempt to lose 10 pounds a week, why would you aim that high?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you love carbs, why would you go on a KETO diet? </span></p>
<p><b><i>Doing these things will essentially set yourself up for failure.</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Set attainable goals that fit YOUR lifestyle. You can always bump things up if your schedule allows, or you notice you aren’t pushing yourself hard enough. Just keep in mind that being realistic isn’t the same as not believing in yourself or making excuses. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moving on to being </span><b><i>specific.</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The more specific you are about your goals, the more likely you will be to reach them. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It may seem like it’s good enough to say things like .. I want to look good, lose weight, or get ripped! </span><b><i>But you have to dig deeper than that!! </i></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wanting to “lose weight,” for example, is an excellent place to start. But ask yourself what that means to you?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you expand on that and say &#8212; “I want to lose 10 pounds of fat. I will do this by not eating any sweets and doing the V Shred </span><a href="https://vshred.com/sp/move/soc-all/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><b>MOVE </b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">program for 30 consecutive days. I am doing this because I want to have better self-esteem and a head start on bikini season.” &#8212; that makes your goal more specific.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The more specific (and attainable) your goals are, the more likely you will be to not give up!</span></p>
<p><b>TIP #6: Reward Yourself</b></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-7459" src="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/vin_sant_32048508_366936073798151_433609263865135104_n.jpg?resize=882%2C1024&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="882" height="1024" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/vin_sant_32048508_366936073798151_433609263865135104_n.jpg?resize=882%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 882w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/vin_sant_32048508_366936073798151_433609263865135104_n.jpg?resize=258%2C300&amp;ssl=1 258w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/vin_sant_32048508_366936073798151_433609263865135104_n.jpg?resize=768%2C892&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/vin_sant_32048508_366936073798151_433609263865135104_n.jpg?w=1080&amp;ssl=1 1080w" sizes="(max-width: 882px) 100vw, 882px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you have checked a “mini goal” off your list, treat yourself. Knowing that you have a reward coming to celebrate your efforts will make you want to achieve it even more. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It may be tempting to make your reward one of your favorite “forbidden foods” but we never suggest that you reward yourself this way.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You aren’t a dog. You should never reward “good behavior” with food. Having this mentality can create a really unhealthy relationship with food.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You need to eat healthy MOST of the time, control your portions, and see food as fuel. But if you are craving something that isn’t quite as healthy as your grilled chicken and rice, never feel like you need to lose 20 pounds to “deserve” a bite of cake, or nice dinner out with your family. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instead of rewarding yourself with food, buy yourself something you have been wanting. Maybe some new workout clothes, a massage, or an extra $20 bucks in your vacation fund! </span></p>

<p><b>TIP #7: Make Mental Health Top Priority</b></p>
<p><img class="size-large wp-image-7460" src="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_255894146.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_255894146.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_255894146.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_255894146.jpeg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_255894146.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_255894146.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Earlier, we mentioned that cold weather motivation dips may not be your fault.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’m sure you have heard of winter blues. Well, it’s a real thing. Less natural light can cause dips in serotonin, the neurotransmitter that regulates mood.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The dark and dreary days of winter can also cause your body to produce more of the sleep hormone melatonin. This shift can disrupt your body and impact your sleep patterns and overall mood.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are a few ways that you can focus on improving your mental health.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Invest in a light therapy box that simulates natural daylight.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Make sure you are supplementing with or eating plenty of foods with Vitamin D.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Start journaling. There is a lot of scientific evidence that supports putting your thoughts on paper provides a long list of benefits, including stress management, self-confidence, and goal setting. </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Suppose you still find yourself struggling with negative seasonal motivation shifts. In that case, you may need to experiment with taking</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> naturally sourced herbs</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to help support brain health and a positive mood.</span></p>
<p><b><i>Here are a few with some great scientific backing to help boost mood.</i></b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>EnXtra: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">A natural caffeine-free patent-pending botanical ingredient that has been shown to help increase dopamine levels.**It is also one of the first and only natural caffeine-free patent-pending botanical ingredients shown to boost mental alertness &amp; acuity for hours or ending in a huge caffeine energy crash.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Piper Nigrum Fruit Extract:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> A very specific type of black pepper that has been shown to help increase both serotonin and dopamine.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>L-Theanine:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> A powerful amino acid that is believed to help reduce occasional anxiety brought on by stressful situations.</span></li>
</ul>

<p><b><i>BOTTOM LINE IF YOU WANT TO STAY MOTIVATED YEAR ROUND</i></b><b><i><br />
</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you put away the shorts and swimsuits and shift out of bikini season, it’s common for motivation to “fall back” with the clocks. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The seasons have to change (unless you live near the equator) &#8211; so you have to figure out ways to</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">not let your fitness goals go into hibernation mode!</span><b><i> </i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pumpkin spice lattes are only here for a limited time, but getting into shape isn’t seasonal! </span><i>It&#8217;s a year-round commitment!!</i><i> </i></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Is Your Gut Bacteria Balanced?</strong><br />
<strong>If not, that explains a lot <em>(maybe even your weight gain)</em></strong></p>
<p><em><strong>“What is on the inside will be reflected on the outside.”</strong></em> &#8212; Don’t worry, we aren’t about to give you a Ted Talk about the importance of inner beauty (but that is important too)</p>
<p>We are about to tell you how VITAL it is that you invest in GUT HEALTH so your body can be healthy enough inside to build muscle and burn fat … <em><strong>and look the way you want it to on the outside.</strong></em></p>
<p>We’ve got a <em><strong>gut instinct</strong></em> that most of you have at least one of the following issues.</p>
<ul>
<li>Occasional Bloating</li>
<li>Occasional Gas</li>
<li>Occasional Constipation</li>
<li>Occasional Diarrhea</li>
<li>Brain Fog</li>
<li>Unrestful Sleep</li>
<li>Exhaustion</li>
<li>A sluggish immune system</li>
<li>Difficulty losing weight</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: center;">We also have a <em><strong>gut feeling</strong></em> as to why.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-6894 size-full" src="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/AdobeStock_140658974.jpeg?resize=1170%2C780&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1170" height="780" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/AdobeStock_140658974.jpeg?w=5760&amp;ssl=1 5760w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/AdobeStock_140658974.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/AdobeStock_140658974.jpeg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/AdobeStock_140658974.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/AdobeStock_140658974.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/AdobeStock_140658974.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1170px) 100vw, 1170px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>Actually… WE KNOW WHY!</p>
<p>Because science tells us that these things could all be happening because… <em><strong>your gut isn’t healthy!</strong></em></p>
<p>You probably already know that an unhealthy gut can be the cause of GI distress.<br />
<em><strong>But the guts connection to WEIGHT LOSS and YOUR IMMUNE SYSTEM</strong></em>…. Might be something you have never considered!</p>
<p><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>In this article, we will explain:</strong></span></em></p>
<ul>
<li>How probiotics can help you lose weight!</li>
<li>How probiotics boost immunity!</li>
<li>How to get your gut health back with probiotics (and what they are.)</li>
<li>The best probiotics strains for whole-body health (and the problem with most on store shelves.)</li>
<li>The OTHER “biotic” your body needs for probiotics to do their job.</li>
</ul>
<p>Before we dive into <em><strong>how your gut could be hindering your ability to lose weight…</strong></em><br />
we need to talk about HOW to get your gut in a balanced and healthy state.</p>
<p>The best way to ensure your gut is happy (and as a result, helps your entire body function properly) is to feed it with&#8230;<em><strong> the right balance of GOOD bacteria.</strong></em></p>
<p>Over 100 trillion microorganisms live in your body. Your gut has been taken over by much of this bacteria since birth.</p>
<p>Bacteria isn’t always a “bad word”.. your gut needs certain types of bacteria to have optimal digestion, healthy immune system function, and a strong metabolism.</p>
<p><em><strong>It becomes “bad” when harmful bacteria take over.</strong></em></p>
<p>Our intestines are under constant attack. A diet lacking diversity and essential micronutrients, stress, toxins in our environment, genetics, and aging, can all cause BAD bacteria to populate.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>You have to balance this out with GOOD bacteria!</strong></em></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-6885 size-full" src="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/AdobeStock_312008058.jpeg?resize=1170%2C752&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1170" height="752" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/AdobeStock_312008058.jpeg?w=4200&amp;ssl=1 4200w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/AdobeStock_312008058.jpeg?resize=300%2C193&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/AdobeStock_312008058.jpeg?resize=768%2C494&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/AdobeStock_312008058.jpeg?resize=1024%2C658&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/AdobeStock_312008058.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/AdobeStock_312008058.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1170px) 100vw, 1170px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><em><strong>Here is how you do that….</strong></em><br />
The best way to support gut health and fight the imbalances that may cause GI issues (and possibly weight gain), is to improve your nutrition and create healthy lifestyle habits.</p>
<p>Exercise .. that’s easy enough.<br />
Nutrition … that’s where things get tricky.</p>
<p>To balance out gut bacteria, you need to figure out how to eat a bunch of food that contains <em><strong>a perfect mix of VERY specific probiotics and prebiotics.</strong></em></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>For reference….</strong></span><br />
<em>Probiotics</em> … are live bacteria. It’s the food your gut likes and needs to stay healthy.<br />
<em>Prebiotics</em> … feed this good bacteria. Think of them as “fertilizer” for probiotics.</p>
<p>Here is a glance at a few of the things you would need to eat (daily) to feed your gut with enough prebiotics and probiotics to make your gut flora balanced, healthy, and happy.</p>
<ul>
<li>Lots of raw/organic veggies and fruits</li>
<li>Some nuts and beans.</li>
<li>Fiber sources such as flax and chia seeds.</li>
<li>A few fermented foods like kimchi, sauerkraut, yogurt, or unpasteurized cheese.</li>
<li>Some foods like coconut, ginger, and olive oil.</li>
</ul>
<p>Are you REALLY going to eat THAT MUCH VARIETY every single day? And can you imagine how expensive it would be to purchase QUALITY foods like this in high amounts?</p>
<p>Wouldn’t it be much easier to take one capsule with meals and know you are giving your gut exactly what it needs to thrive (and set you up for your weight loss goals.)</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>Exactly why we developed <a href="https://sculptnation.com/products/probiotics">Sculpt Nation Probiotics</a>!</strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://sculptnation.com/products/probiotics"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6921" src="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/ezgif-2-bc5238f7a928.gif?resize=600%2C600&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="600" height="600" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

<strong>Today only! <a href="https://sculptnation.com/products/probiotics">==&gt; CLICK HERE</a></strong></p>
<p>For years, we have been studying all of the latest research on gut health. Before we released a Probiotic, we wanted to make sure it was only the best on the market.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>Mission accomplished &#8211; <a href="https://sculptnation.com/products/probiotics">Sculpt Nation Probiotics</a> are now available!</strong></em></p>
<p>We know that there are THOUSANDS of probiotics on store shelves. You are probably asking yourself what makes ours any different?</p>
<p><em><strong>Here are a few problems with most probiotics….</strong></em></p>
<ul>
<li>Most are nothing more than tablets filled with only a few (if any) LIVE and ACTIVE probiotics.</li>
<li>They do not contain the RIGHT BLEND of bacteria.</li>
<li>Most generic probiotics products starve your beneficial bacteria because they don’t include PREbiotics.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>We wanted to take out all of the confusion.</strong></p>
<p>Rather than spending countless hours asking Google, or scanning every store shelf totally overwhelmed with all of the options,<em><strong> we developed the most powerful and complete blend of “gut food” that money can buy!</strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><em><strong>Here is a breakdown of what every <a href="https://sculptnation.com/products/probiotics">Sculpt Nation PROBIOTICS </a>serving contains.</strong></em></p>
<p>Let’s start with the ingredient most probiotics on the market DO NOT HAVE… but should!</p>
<p>It’s not a Probiotic.<br />
It is a PRE-biotic.</p>
<p><em><strong>We briefly touched on this earlier but to re-cap…</strong></em>PREbiotics are different than PRObiotics.</p>
<p>PREbiotics are not bacteria. They are a special type of fiber that feeds your good bacteria.</p>
<p>Most of the fiber you eat from your diet is not this type of special type of fiber; one reason why supplementing with it is important!</p>
<p>The prebiotic we choose to put in our <a href="https://sculptnation.com/products/probiotics">Sculpt Nation Probiotic Blend</a> is called INULIN <em>(a unique type of prebiotic fiber found in plants.)</em></p>
<p>Look at prebiotics and probiotics as a team. Probiotics need food to work. That food is prebiotics. <em><strong>You shouldn’t be supplementing with one… and not the other.</strong></em></p>
<p><a href="https://sculptnation.com/products/probiotics"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6916" src="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Probiotics.png?resize=800%2C828&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="800" height="828" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Probiotics.png?w=800&amp;ssl=1 800w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Probiotics.png?resize=290%2C300&amp;ssl=1 290w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Probiotics.png?resize=768%2C795&amp;ssl=1 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><em><strong>Okay, now let’s move on to the 7 LIVE PROBIOTICS in our unique PROBIOTICS blend.</strong></em></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Bacillus Coagulans</strong> &#8211; Shown to help support protein absorption and recovery from exercise. This results in reduced muscle damage and soreness. Other studies show it helps reduce occasional bloating.</li>
<li><strong>Lactobacillus Acidophilus</strong> &#8211; This is one of the strongest, most researched, and most well-known probiotics. Studies rave about its ability to help promote better digestive health, support regularity and strengthen immune system function.</li>
<li><strong>Bifidobacterium Bifidum</strong> &#8211; This is an important one because it makes up around 80% of your intestinal microflora. Studies show it can help with occasional stress, increase levels of good bacteria in the gut, and act as an antioxidant.</li>
<li><strong>Bifidobacterium Longum</strong> &#8211; This one can also combat stress, as well as help support learning, boost memory, and improve mood.</li>
<li><strong>Strepococcus Thermophilius</strong> &#8211; Shown to help support a healthy immune system, promote oral health, and the overall composition of your gut’s microflora.</li>
<li><strong>Lactobacillus Bulgaricus (Delbrueckii)</strong> &#8211; Another research-backed and very powerful immune system booster.</li>
<li><strong>Lactobacillus Paracasei</strong> &#8211; Can support the strength of your intestinal barrier, aid in nutrient absorption, and help with immune system health.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Now that you understand HOW TO FEED YOUR GUT </strong><em><strong>(and what makes <a href="https://sculptnation.com/products/probiotics">OUR BLEND</a> unique)</strong></em><br />
<strong>Let’s go over how PROBIOTICS may help you lose weight!</strong></p>
<p><img class="size-large wp-image-6914" src="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/AdobeStock_314724372.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/AdobeStock_314724372.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/AdobeStock_314724372.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/AdobeStock_314724372.jpeg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/AdobeStock_314724372.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/AdobeStock_314724372.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>Numerous studies have found that overweight people have different gut bacteria than either normal-weight or skinny people.<br />
We could stop here, and you would probably be sold on the fact that <em><strong>a healthy gut can NO DOUBT can have an impact on your weight.</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>But let’s keep going&#8230;</strong></em><br />
Researchers have conducted studies where they transplanted gut bacteria from obese mice into the guts of lean mice&#8230;and the lean mice got fat!!</p>
<p><em><strong>Crazy, right?!</strong></em></p>
<p>Studies like this make it pretty evident that gut bacteria play a significant role in weight regulation.</p>
<p><em><strong>But how?!</strong></em></p>
<ul>
<li>Probiotics may help release a hormone in your body that tells you you are full. Higher levels of this appetite-reducing hormone (GLP-1) also help you burn more fat.</li>
<li>Probiotics may support improved fat metabolism by encouraging an increase in levels of a protein called ANGPTL4 (a circulating protein involved in the regulation of fatty acid metabolism.)</li>
<li>Probiotics may support a healthy, normal inflammatory response, which can contribute to weight issues.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Probiotics can play a POWERFUL role in weight management</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Plus… let’s not forget the many other reasons to take a probiotic supplement… like improved GI health, energy balance, emotional support, optimal brain health, and immune support.<br />
But they are not magic pills.</p>
<p><strong>Probiotics &amp; Your Immune System</strong><br />
70-80% of immune cells live in your gut. It makes perfect sense that if your gut isn’t healthy, your immune system won’t be either!</p>
<p>We’ve already told you the numerous ways probiotics strengthen your gut. Because of that you are already helping support the strength of your immune system. This is especially important for immune support because the intestinal lining contains specialized cells to maintain health during times of challenge.</p>
<p>Beyond that, quality probiotics have also been demonstrated to support immunity by boosting immune cells and increasing key immune-boosting antibodies.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>Probiotics are not magic pills.</strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">They are just one tool in your arsenal for creating a healthier you.<br />
You need to combine supplements with a healthy diet and regular training program to get the best results.<br />
Nutrients that give you the energy to work out are crucial. Eat a blend of lean proteins, healthy fats, vitamin-rich fruits, and vegetables (or a powdered supplement like <strong><a href="https://sculptnation.com/products/greens">THESE</a></strong>.)</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Meal prepping helps you stay committed to a good diet.</p>
<p>Let me show you how to do it</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>DO YOU STRUGGLE TO SLEEP?</strong> If so, you are not alone. We are, no doubt, a sleep-deprived nation. A recent poll found that 40 percent of Americans get 6 hours of sleep or less per night and 50 million to 70 million adults in the U.S. have chronic sleep disorders.</p>
<p>Sleep alone won’t get you your dream body, but lack of sleep may be a reason you aren’t making progress and could certainly keep you from reaching your full potential. In fact, lack of sleep can indeed cause you to gain weight! When sleep goes down, it’s almost inevitable that weight will eventually go up! Tons of research has proven the importance of sleep. So much, that it is known as the “third pillar” of good health, right up there with exercise and proper nutrition.</p>
<p>Nutrition and exercise are widely discussed as vital to our health, meanwhile sleep is still neglected, and those sleepless nights are taking a toll.</p>
<p><strong>HOW MUCH SLEEP DO YOU REALLY NEED?</strong><br />
According to the American Sleep Association, here is a break-down based on age.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-6371" src="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Sleep-infographic.jpg?resize=1024%2C694&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="694" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Sleep-infographic.jpg?resize=1024%2C694&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Sleep-infographic.jpg?resize=300%2C203&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Sleep-infographic.jpg?resize=768%2C521&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Sleep-infographic.jpg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Sleep-infographic.jpg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>Sleep is essential for everyone no matter your fitness level, but quality Zzz’s are even more critical if you are working hard in the gym because sleep allows your body to recover fully.</p>
<p>Sleep also allows hormones to level out. This is why lack of sleep is often tied to issues losing weight or weight gain.</p>
<p>Lack of shut-eye reduces the hormone leptin, which is responsible for suppressing appetite and encourages the body to expend energy. It also increases the hormone ghrelin, which does the exact opposite and actually triggers feelings of hunger. Another hormone that is elevated when you don’t get enough sleep is the stress hormone Cortisol. This hormone plays many roles, including regulating the sleep-wake cycle, managing how the body utilizes carbohydrates, fats, and protein, reducing inflammation, and controlling blood pressure.</p>
<p><strong>WHAT DOES THIS MEAN?</strong><br />
It means if you aren’t getting quality sleep, your hormones are going to make you want to eat more, and your metabolism is going to be slower.</p>
<p><strong>Other reasons lack of sleep could cause you to gain weight include:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Stress</strong> <em>(which can impact the body in MANY ways)</em></li>
<li>Higher Probability Of Making Unhealthy Food Choices</li>
<li>More Likely To Skip The Gym</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>THE GOOD NEWS IS</strong> … there are ways you can train your body to get more shut-eye. There are also some NATURAL SUPPLEMENTS that will not only help you fall asleep and get deeper sleep but help you <strong>burn more fat while you sleep!</strong></p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='1170' height='659' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/pfr9gsbaDo0?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></p>
<p>Our favorite research-backed sleep supplement is <a href="https://sculptnation.com/product/burn-pm/"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Burn PM by Sculpt Nation</strong></span></a>. It will help you fall asleep and get deep sleep. Just make sure you are getting at least 6 hours of sleep when taking this supplement to avoid waking up groggy.</p>
<p><strong>THE BOTTOM LINE</strong><br />
It’s not so much that you will lose fat just because you sleep. But if you are sleep-deprived, your body, hormones, and metabolism will not function properly. These are things that could result in weight gain and/or a weight loss plateau. Remember, sleep should never be considered some sort of luxury. It should be seen as a necessity.</p>

Now you can, Burn PM by Sculpt Nation is a nighttime thermogenic designed to help you burn fat specifically while you sleep! Keep reading to learn the science behind it and how to burn fat up to 200% faster using a night time fat burner.</p>
<p>In this article:</p>
<h2>How to Burn Fat with Burn PM Even While You’re Asleep</h2>
<h3>1. Choose a supplement that helps increase Leptin levels.</h3>
<p><a href="https://sculptnation.com/product/burn-pm/"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-6046 size-large" src="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/burn-pm-fat-blog-post.png?resize=1024%2C1024&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="1024" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/burn-pm-fat-blog-post.png?resize=1024%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/burn-pm-fat-blog-post.png?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 150w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/burn-pm-fat-blog-post.png?resize=300%2C300&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/burn-pm-fat-blog-post.png?resize=768%2C768&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/burn-pm-fat-blog-post.png?resize=60%2C60&amp;ssl=1 60w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/burn-pm-fat-blog-post.png?w=1080&amp;ssl=1 1080w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>Think of Leptin as your body&#8217;s fat burning superhero. Leptin is a hormone the fat tissues produce and secrete. Its primary role is to signal the brain to decrease appetite and increase metabolic rate.</p>
<p>Studies show that how many hours you sleep directly affects your production of Leptin. Sleep too little, or too lightly, and your body’s fat burning machinery shuts down. Burn PM helps you fall into a deep sleep, which increases your Leptin levels, and keeps you burning fat 24/7. As a result, you can enjoy maximum fat-burning benefits.</p>
<h3>2. Choose a supplement that helps decrease Cortisol</h3>
<p>As I previously mentioned Leptin is your body&#8217;s fat burning superhero. But every superhero has a villain. In this case that villain is Cortisol, and it’s intent on making you fat especially in your stomach and love handles. Cortisol increases  s<span>ugar cravings,</span> your appetite<span>, and puts your body into fat-storage mode. When your under stress or tired cortisol is produced. </span></p>
<p>It triggers the fight or flight response in correlation with adrenaline. High steady levels of cortisol can damage us mentally and physically.</p>
<p><span>Burn PM contains sleep-inducing ingredients to help squash Cortisol and increase Leptin</span>.</p>
<h3>3. Get Your Metabolism Working in Your Sleep</h3>
<p>At first glance, you might feel the best way to <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/best-way-get-rid-belly-fat/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">burn belly fat</a> in your sleep doesn’t exist, but it’s actually possible with the right combination of diet, exercise, and supplementation.</p>
<p>With that being said, I cannot stress enough that no matter how many supplements you are taking, they will never fill the void of proper nutrition and exercise. Please do yourself a favor and get that taken care of first. If you need some help finding the right diet and training for your body type you can take our <a href="https://vshred.com/sp/survey/survey-aka1"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>free quiz here</strong></span></a> and we&#8217;ll match you with the perfect training and nutrition plan for your body type and goals.</p>
<p>If you already have your diet and training in check adding a night time fat burner like Burn PM will send your metabolism into overdrive while decreasing your appetite and bloating.  get your diet and training regime correct try incorporating foods that burn belly fat such as cayenne, green tea, lean meat, and grapefruits into your fat-burning diet. Instead of the usual junk you eat, munch on these belly fat-burning foods instead.</p>
<p>Lastly, stick to a consistent sleeping pattern. Staying up too late at night increases your stress levels and appetite while decreasing your metabolism rate and insulin sensitivity.The quantity and quality of your sleep directly affects your metabolism, energy levels, and fat-burning ability. So it&#8217;s important your getting enough consistent sleep every night.</p>
<h3>4. Suppress Your Appetite</h3>
<p>You can naturally suppress your appetite by sticking to a healthy diet. If you usually consume a lot of junk, you won’t get the long-lasting energy you need to conquer the day.</p>
<p>Follow a diet consisting of fiber, protein, minerals, and vitamins. Combining these foods will help cleanse your digestive tract and feed your muscles the nutrients they need to grow.</p>
<p>People also tend to opt for high-calorie snacks when they’re running low on sleep, so stick to a regular sleeping pattern and stay away from easily accessible junk foods.</p>
<p>Those snacks may give you a quick energy boost, but sleep is still the best way for your body to recover. There’s no substitute for a deep, body-recovering slumber.</p>
<h3>5. Take the Best Fat-Burning Supplements</h3>
<p><a href="https://sculptnation.com/product/burn-pm/"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-6045 size-large" src="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/vince-burnpm-pl07.png?resize=1024%2C1024&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="1024" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/vince-burnpm-pl07.png?resize=1024%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/vince-burnpm-pl07.png?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 150w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/vince-burnpm-pl07.png?resize=300%2C300&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/vince-burnpm-pl07.png?resize=768%2C768&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/vince-burnpm-pl07.png?resize=60%2C60&amp;ssl=1 60w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/vince-burnpm-pl07.png?w=1080&amp;ssl=1 1080w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>To maximize the results from your fat-burning workout routines, combine every workout with the right supplements. Here’re the ingredients your night time fat-burning supplement needs to have:</p>
<h4>A. Raspberry Ketones</h4>
<p>There are times where we just want to slice our belly open and suck the fat out. While that’s not normally possible, Raspberry Ketones can do something similar.</p>
<p>It’s an ingredient that helps burn fat fast by boosting your metabolism. Raspberry Ketones have been shown in animal studies to help your body eviscerate fat within your body’s cells.</p>
<p>Plus, it produces Adiponectin. This protein plays a vital role in regulating and maintaining healthy metabolic levels.</p>
<p>When paired with effective <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/best-weight-loss-exercises/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">fat-burning exercises</a>, Raspberry Ketones will supercharge your fat loss.</p>
<h4>B. L-Tryptophan</h4>
<p>L-Tryptophan has been scientifically proven to be on of the most powerful natural sleep aids in the world</p>
<p>This important ingredient helps crush Cortisol, and makes it easier to fall into a deep, muscle-building, fat-burning sleep. As a result, you can enjoy better, deeper periods of sleep while maximizing the fat-burning zone.</p>
<p>Sadly, the body doesn’t produce L-Tryptophan.<span>That’s why it’s ultra important to get this powerful ingredient into your body through supplements. Burn PM</span><span class="mobile-p-break"> uses a potent strain of L-Tryptophan to help you get better sleep and improve performance.</span></p>
<h4>C. White Kidney Beans</h4>
<p>Your overall body fat levels increase when your system converts starch into fat. Want to stop your body from converting starches to fat? Exercise helps burn off excess starches from the food you eat, but unfortunately, there will always be some left in your bloodstream.</p>
<p>White Kidney Beans have been proven to help prevent your body from using those extra starches and blocks them from becoming body fat. <span style="font-size: 1rem;">As a result, you can maintain a steady lean, fit weight.</span></p>
<h4>D. Lemon Balm Leaf</h4>
<p>Too many fitness buffs neglect the importance of sleep. While you do need to put in some extra work to achieve your fitness goals, it’s equally important to provide your body with the rest it needs.</p>
<p><span>Lemon Balm Leaf is a powerful natural sleep aid. Remember, sleeping deeply every night helps curb cortisol levels, which helps your body get out of fat-storage mode while turning on your body’s fat-burning machinery. Lemon Balm Leaf is loaded with antioxidants and improves digestion, which can help your body torch fat faster.</span></p>
<p>If you’re having trouble sleeping at night, using a supplement like Burn PM that contains lemon balm leaf will help you get that relaxing, deep slumber every night.</p>
<h4>E. Saffron Flower</h4>
<p>Saffron Flower is loaded with special antioxidants, including crocetin and crocins, that hunt down and destroy fat in your bloodstream. Saffron Flower’s antioxidant blend is so powerful that studies have shown it can support healthy glucose, help with triglycerides, and help lower LDL cholesterol levels in your blood while increasing your body’s energy expenditure and burning fat in your lower body.</p>
<p><span>This means that Saffron Flower can improve your health while helping you lose fat faster by increasing the number of calories your body burns, even while e</span>ven while you’re dozing off to dreamland.</p>
<h4>F. Green Coffee Bean Extract</h4>
<p>If you want to burn belly fat fast, you need to regulate and maintain your insulin and blood sugar levels. When the body produces more insulin, you tend to feel hungrier and the body stores belly fat.</p>
<p>Not even the best fat-burning workouts would have any effect if you have high insulin levels. As such, if you want to <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/get-six-pack/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">sculpt a solid six-pack</a>, you need to keep your insulin levels at bay.</p>
<p>Luckily, Green Coffee Bean Extract contains Chlorogenic Acid which has been shown to keep your insulin levels from spiking and may help keep your blood sugar regulated. It has also been shown to help reduce the amount of fat absorbed from your diet, and reduce the fat stored in your liver by increasing your body’s natural fat burning hormone, adiponectin.</p>
<p>Why not just drink coffee? Unfortunately Chlorogenic Acid is destroyed when coffee is roasted. Luckily, we’ve isolated this powerful fat loss agent and loaded a maximum dose into Burn PM.</p>
<h4>G. Dandelion Root</h4>
<p>We all know how troubling indigestion, constipation, and bloating are. Luckily, you can ease these symptoms by supplementing with dandelion root.</p>
<p>It’s a natural digestive aid people all across the globe have been using for centuries now. Up to today, many use Dandelion Roots to help promote a healthy digestive tract.</p>
<p>Dandelion Roots also provide the body with vitamin A, which is important to maintain a strong, disease-resistant immune system.</p>
<h4>H. Melatonin</h4>
<p>Melatonin is a holistic ingredient that can help you shed fat whether you’re awake or asleep.</p>
<p>Apart from being a potent sleeping aid that helps you achieve a deep, body-healing slumber, it also increases your body’s levels of &#8220;Beige&#8221; fat.</p>
<p>Beige fat increase your body’s thermic-sensitivity to exercise. Quite simply, this fat helps your body shred more fat every time you workout.</p>
<p>Every dose of Burn PM gives your body the Melatonin it needs to help you fall asleep, and increase beneficial Beige Fat.</p>
<h4>I. Vitamin D3 Cholecalciferol</h4>
<p>Fitness is a 24/7 journey, and you have to keep track of your body all the time. That’s why you should find a way to help your body burn fat on its own even during your idle moments.</p>
<p>Otherwise, you limit your fat-burning process to the hours when you’re awake and moving. Luckily, you can increase leptin levels, suppress appetite, and boost metabolism around the clock with vitamin D3.</p>
<p>Vitamin D3 plays a major role in increasing the amount of leptin in the body. That way, there’s more than enough to burn body fat even during your inactive state.</p>
<p>Plus, vitamin D3 signals your brain to curb your appetite. In fact, an Australian study showed that a vitamin D-fortified breakfast can drastically reduce your appetite for the next 24 hours.</p>
<p>This is the perfect supplement for gym-goers who plan to go on a low-calorie, low-carb diet but still need sufficient energy to hit the gym.</p>
<p>If you want to maximize the hard-earned results from the belly fat-burning exercises you routinely do, then you should start taking the right supplements as well. Proper diet and exercise can only take you so far in your fitness journey. Taking supplements that contain all the key ingredients, such as <a href="https://sculptnation.com/product/burn-pm/"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Burn PM</strong></span></a> will help you achieve a fit, lean, well-sculpted body by shedding off unwanted fat even as you sleep.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you&#8217;re looking for a new pre-workout supplement to help you burn fat fast in the gym, keep an eye out for these essential ingredients.</p>
<h2>7 Essential Ingredients for Maximum Fat Burn</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Choose the Best <a href="https://sculptnation.com/product/burn-fat-burner/">Fat Burning Supplements</a></h3>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Needless to say, it’s hard as heck to lose body fat. It’s one of the most stubborn things to lose when hitting your fitness goals. There are a lot of <a href="https://sculptnation.com/product/burn-fat-burner/">fat burning supplements</a> out there to choose from, so we made a list of the must-haves when examining the label.</span></p>
<h3>1. Produce B.A.T (Brown Adipose Tissue)</h3>
<p>Brown adipose tissue or brown fat is a type of human fat that&#8217;s responsible for turning the calories from the food you eat into body heat. This type of human fat commonly builds up around the neck.</p>
<p>When this tissue is active, it burns large amounts of glucose and lipids in the tissues. People with high levels of brown fat experience various health benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>Improved blood sugar levels</li>
<li>Increase in insulin sensitivity</li>
<li>Faster metabolism to burn calories</li>
<li>Decreases risk of diabetes and obesity</li>
</ul>
<h3>2. Mobilizes and Removes Fat Cells</h3>
<p>Mobilization of the fat cells is the second phase when it comes to effective fat-burning. Once the fatty acids in your food are separated, they are carried to cells for energy.</p>
<p>In order to mobilize these fat cells, keep an eye out for supplements that promote albumin production. Albumin is a protein carrier that moves the fat cells because its lipid texture stops it from traveling through the bloodstream on its own.</p>
<p>At the same time, fat supplements with thermogenic agents increase the demand for energy within the cells. Thermogenesis is the metabolic process of your body that burns calories in order to produce body heat.</p>
<h3>3. Includes Cayenne Pepper</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-5811 size-full" src="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/cayenne-pepper-Burn-ss.jpg?resize=625%2C400&#038;ssl=1" alt="Includes Cayenne Pepper | The Must-Haves in a Fat-Burning Supplement" width="625" height="400" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/cayenne-pepper-Burn-ss.jpg?w=625&amp;ssl=1 625w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/cayenne-pepper-Burn-ss.jpg?resize=300%2C192&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>This spice contains capsaicin which is a compound that delivers a list of <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/best-supplements-for-weight-loss/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">weight loss</a> benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>Improves circulation</li>
<li>Helps shed more fat and maintain muscle while dieting</li>
<li>Generates body heat for increased long-term metabolic rate</li>
<li>Supports healthy blood sugar levels</li>
<li>Suppresses Ghrelin</li>
</ul>
<p>Ghrelin is commonly known as the hunger hormone and it is released by the stomach, intestines, pancreas, and brain. It&#8217;s responsible for stimulating appetite and promotes fat storage.</p>
<p>The suppression of your ghrelin production can reduce your appetite by almost 30% and help you develop healthier eating habits. Regulation of this hormone is extremely beneficial for weight management.</p>
<h3>4. Includes Hydrochloride and Rauwolscine</h3>
<p>Betaine hydrochloride (HCL) is a common ingredient in most fat-burning supplements. HCL regulates stomach acid production to properly break down your food intake.</p>
<p>Higher levels of stomach acid improve digestion and the absorption of nutrients. Better digestion also supports protein synthesis for lean muscle development.</p>
<p>Rauwolscine or Alpha-Yohimbine in its hydrochloric form is effective for blocking alpha receptors which stop lipolysis, which is the process of fat breakdown in the body. Rauwolscine can boost lipolysis beyond the point where it naturally stops when you exercise.  Beta receptors are responsible for lipolysis, and Rauwolscine allows these receptors to continue working, forcing the body to burn fat storage for energy.</p>
<p>At the same time, Rauwolscine increases available fatty acids for burning during and following exercise. It also works synergistically with caffeine and EGCG.</p>
<p>EGCG is a type of catechin commonly found in green tea. It has been researched for its potential to improve metabolic health. Paired with caffeine, these ingredients can suppress weight gain and fat storage.</p>
<h3>5. Paradise Seed Extract</h3>
<p>Paradise seeds or grains of paradise are often used as a spice but it&#8217;s a potent fat-burning compound. A single ingestion of the extract offer these weight loss benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Activates brown adipose tissue:</strong> to blowtorch body <span style="font-size: 1rem;">fat from the inside out.</span></li>
<li><strong>Increases energy expenditure:</strong> for extra fat-burning without cutting calories.</li>
<li><strong>Visceral fat buster:</strong> helps <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/get-rid-belly-fat/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">burn belly fat</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h3>6. Caffeine</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-5810 size-full" src="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Caffeine-Burn.jpg?resize=625%2C479&#038;ssl=1" alt="Caffeine | The Must-Haves in a Fat-Burning Supplement" width="625" height="479" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Caffeine-Burn.jpg?w=625&amp;ssl=1 625w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Caffeine-Burn.jpg?resize=300%2C230&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>Caffeine is a natural compound that stimulates your nervous system and metabolic process. Most fat burning pills contain caffeine because of what it does to help weight loss:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fat mobilizer:</strong> helps release fat from your cells, <a href="https://sculptnation.com/product/burn-fat-burner/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">making SculptNation&#8217;s BURN</a> the perfect pre-workout supplement to melt extra fat while you train.</li>
<li><strong>Increases energy by blocking adenosine:</strong> have more energy to train and tackle your day while dieting.</li>
<li><strong>Raises metabolic rate:</strong> more fat burning power without eating less.</li>
<li><strong>Short and long-term fat loss:</strong> get your dream body faster, and hold onto it.</li>
</ul>
<h3>7. EGCG (Epigallocatechin Gallate)</h3>
<p>Of all the ingredients in fat burning supplements, EGCG is one of the most important. This potent and natural compound offers a list of benefits to boost your body&#8217;s fat burning process, prevent weight gain, and improve your performance workout:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Jam-packed with polyphenols:</strong> anti-inflammatory effects help you recover rapidly from training.</li>
<li><strong>Boosts metabolic rate and mobilizes fat:</strong> jack up your metabolism and pull the fat out of your cells to be melted down for energy.</li>
<li><strong>Increases fat oxidation:</strong> studies show a significant increase in the amount of fat your body can burn.</li>
<li><strong>Natural appetite suppressant:</strong> keep hunger at bay naturally, making dieting so much easier.</li>
<li><strong>Belly fat destroyer:</strong> helps decrease central body fat.</li>
<li><strong>Increases norepinephrine:</strong> boost your body’s fat-burning hormone for rapid and long-term fat loss.</li>
</ul>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Learn what your protein powder supplement should have if you want to build lean muscle, shed unwanted fat, and improve strength fast.</p>
<h2>7 Things to Look Out for When Choosing Your Protein Powder</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>1. 90% Whey Protein for Superior Absorption</h3>
<p>When choosing your <a href="https://sculptnation.com/product/protein-chocolate/">protein supplement</a>, go with the one that best supports protein absorption. Choosing supplements with low-protein absorption won’t give you the results you want.</p>
<p>Make sure to grab the ones made of pure protein. Protein powder shouldn&#8217;t contain any unnecessary fillers or calories the body will only store as fat.</p>
<p>On the other hand, fast-reacting <a href="https://sculptnation.com/product/protein-vanilla/">protein supplements</a> can stimulate the body’s anabolic system. This type of whey protein is important to incorporate into your post-workout routine to maximize the anabolic window.</p>
<p><strong>Anabolic Window</strong>: The anabolic window is the 30-minute time frame after a workout where the body shifts from a catabolic state to an anabolic one. During this window, the muscle needs as many nutrients as possible to recover properly.</p>
<h3>2. Fast-Acting BCAAs</h3>
<p><!-- instagram error: invalid instagram resource --></p>
<p><a href="https://sculptnation.com/product/bcaas/">BCAAs</a> are three of the nine essential amino acids that make up about 35% of our body’s muscle mass. The main role of BCAAs is to support muscle recovery and prevent muscle breakdown simultaneously.</p>
<p>As a gym-goer, taking protein powder supplements with fast-acting BCAAs allows you to recover from an intense gym day faster than you would without taking it.</p>
<p>Plus, BCAAs decrease the chances of your body burning protein. Instead, they feed the protein directly to your muscles.</p>
<p>It’s best to take BCAA-filled protein powder supplements after your workout, on recovery days, and calorie-restricted time frames.</p>
<p><strong>BCAAs:</strong> The acronym stands for Branch-Chained Amino Acids. You can take them as a <a href="https://sculptnation.com/product/bcaas/">standalone supplement</a> or use <a href="https://sculptnation.com/product/protein-chocolate/">protein supplements that utilize them</a>.</p>
<h3>3. High Bioavailability</h3>
<p>When it comes to whey protein, every second counts. As we said, the body needs to absorb the nutrients within 30 minutes of finishing a workout.</p>
<p>That’s why gym-goers should only choose protein supplements with a high bioavailability rate. Every single gram of protein, carbs, and other nutrients should go directly to your body.</p>
<p>The body only benefits from your supplement’s nutrients if it successfully absorbs them. Otherwise, it’ll just leave you bloated and gassy with zero results.</p>
<p><strong>Bioavailability:</strong> It is the portion of a supplement, drug, or any substance that allows the components to successfully enter the body’s circulation.</p>
<h3>4. Meal Replacement</h3>
<p>When dieting, the goal is to eat fewer calories throughout the day. Sadly, most low-calorie foods don’t give us the energy we need to last extended hours without food.</p>
<p>To counter this, many gym-goers count on food supplements to get longer-lasting energy. But the question is: what food supplement can we use as a meal replacement?</p>
<p>Keep in mind that not every protein powder supplement out there is a suitable meal replacement. Most of them don’t have enough fast-acting protein and amino acids for gym-goers to source their energy from.</p>
<p>That’s why you need to use a whey protein supplement that provides an array of nutrients the body can absorb and convert to energy. As opposed to solely relying on food, using whey protein may help you lose weight faster without sacrificing lean muscle mass.</p>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> Feel free to pair this supplement with some high-protein foods to maximize the results from your<a href="https://vshred.com/blog/high-protein-diet-plans/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> protein diet plan</a> for weight-loss or<a href="https://vshred.com/blog/how-to-gain-muscle-mass/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> muscle gain</a>.</p>
<h3>5. Non-GMO</h3>
<p>Before taking any type of supplement, make sure the label says its all-natural and non-GMO. Consuming artificially sourced supplements may lead to health complications.</p>
<p>Apart from delaying the gains, your body might react negatively if you consume too much of a GMO. Plus, creating GMO&#8217;s is not only a health hazard, but it’s also a threat to the environment.</p>
<p><strong>GMO:</strong> The abbreviation GMO stands for genetically modified organism. Researchers and scientists create this as a cheaper alternative to many organic ingredients.</p>
<h3>6. Leucine</h3>
<p><!-- instagram error: invalid instagram resource --></p>
<p>Protein supplements will only be effective if you combine them with the right amino acids. Of the nine essential amino acids, leucine plays one of the most important roles.</p>
<p>In fact, leucine is responsible for activating the protein compounds. It’s the amino which allows the body to reap the full benefits of a protein powder supplement.</p>
<p>Plus, it can also lower the body’s blood sugar by releasing insulin from the pancreas. This is good news for fitness buffs who struggle with high blood sugar.</p>
<p>That’s why when choosing your protein supplement, make sure to go with one that has a good amount of amino acids such as leucine.</p>
<h3>7. Taste</h3>
<p>Let’s face it: everybody hates foul-tasting protein powder. You shouldn’t force yourself to stomach a whole bottle of a protein shake that tastes like rotten fruit and smells like rotten cheese &#8211;even if it has insane amounts of protein.</p>
<p>That’s why you should only use easy-to-mix, delicious protein powder supplements. You’re making enough sacrifices as it is. There’s no need to down protein shakes that taste terrible.</p>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> Drinking the same protein shake every day can get boring. To prevent this, try some delicious, exciting <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/healthy-protein-shake-recipes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">protein shake recipes</a> every now and then.</p>
<p>It’s a great way to spice up your post-workout routine. Plus, it’ll give you something new to look forward to after an intense training session.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall, these are the top seven things you need to keep an eye out for when buying your protein supplements. Make sure you only purchase the brand that checks all of these boxes.</p>
<p>If you want to maximize the benefits of whey protein, you need to combine it with regular exercise and healthy dieting. Create a body-specific fitness plan that aligns with your lifestyle, goals, and needs then stick to it. No excuses!</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Here we answer some frequently asked questions about fat burner supplements and how it affects our body.</p>
<h2>Fat Burner FAQs For Fitness Buffs</h2>

<h3>What&#8217;s a Fat Burner?</h3>
