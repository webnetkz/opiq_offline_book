Now you can, Burn PM by Sculpt Nation is a nighttime thermogenic designed to help you burn fat specifically while you sleep! Keep reading to learn the science behind it and how to burn fat up to 200% faster using a night time fat burner.</p>
<p>In this article:</p>
<h2>How to Burn Fat with Burn PM Even While You’re Asleep</h2>
<h3>1. Choose a supplement that helps increase Leptin levels.</h3>
<p><a href="https://sculptnation.com/product/burn-pm/"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-6046 size-large" src="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/burn-pm-fat-blog-post.png?resize=1024%2C1024&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="1024" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/burn-pm-fat-blog-post.png?resize=1024%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/burn-pm-fat-blog-post.png?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 150w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/burn-pm-fat-blog-post.png?resize=300%2C300&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/burn-pm-fat-blog-post.png?resize=768%2C768&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/burn-pm-fat-blog-post.png?resize=60%2C60&amp;ssl=1 60w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/burn-pm-fat-blog-post.png?w=1080&amp;ssl=1 1080w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>Think of Leptin as your body&#8217;s fat burning superhero. Leptin is a hormone the fat tissues produce and secrete. Its primary role is to signal the brain to decrease appetite and increase metabolic rate.</p>
<p>Studies show that how many hours you sleep directly affects your production of Leptin. Sleep too little, or too lightly, and your body’s fat burning machinery shuts down. Burn PM helps you fall into a deep sleep, which increases your Leptin levels, and keeps you burning fat 24/7. As a result, you can enjoy maximum fat-burning benefits.</p>
<h3>2. Choose a supplement that helps decrease Cortisol</h3>
<p>As I previously mentioned Leptin is your body&#8217;s fat burning superhero. But every superhero has a villain. In this case that villain is Cortisol, and it’s intent on making you fat especially in your stomach and love handles. Cortisol increases  s<span>ugar cravings,</span> your appetite<span>, and puts your body into fat-storage mode. When your under stress or tired cortisol is produced. </span></p>
<p>It triggers the fight or flight response in correlation with adrenaline. High steady levels of cortisol can damage us mentally and physically.</p>
<p><span>Burn PM contains sleep-inducing ingredients to help squash Cortisol and increase Leptin</span>.</p>
<h3>3. Get Your Metabolism Working in Your Sleep</h3>
<p>At first glance, you might feel the best way to <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/best-way-get-rid-belly-fat/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">burn belly fat</a> in your sleep doesn’t exist, but it’s actually possible with the right combination of diet, exercise, and supplementation.</p>
<p>With that being said, I cannot stress enough that no matter how many supplements you are taking, they will never fill the void of proper nutrition and exercise. Please do yourself a favor and get that taken care of first. If you need some help finding the right diet and training for your body type you can take our <a href="https://vshred.com/sp/survey/survey-aka1"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>free quiz here</strong></span></a> and we&#8217;ll match you with the perfect training and nutrition plan for your body type and goals.</p>
<p>If you already have your diet and training in check adding a night time fat burner like Burn PM will send your metabolism into overdrive while decreasing your appetite and bloating.  get your diet and training regime correct try incorporating foods that burn belly fat such as cayenne, green tea, lean meat, and grapefruits into your fat-burning diet. Instead of the usual junk you eat, munch on these belly fat-burning foods instead.</p>
<p>Lastly, stick to a consistent sleeping pattern. Staying up too late at night increases your stress levels and appetite while decreasing your metabolism rate and insulin sensitivity.The quantity and quality of your sleep directly affects your metabolism, energy levels, and fat-burning ability. So it&#8217;s important your getting enough consistent sleep every night.</p>
<h3>4. Suppress Your Appetite</h3>
<p>You can naturally suppress your appetite by sticking to a healthy diet. If you usually consume a lot of junk, you won’t get the long-lasting energy you need to conquer the day.</p>
<p>Follow a diet consisting of fiber, protein, minerals, and vitamins. Combining these foods will help cleanse your digestive tract and feed your muscles the nutrients they need to grow.</p>
<p>People also tend to opt for high-calorie snacks when they’re running low on sleep, so stick to a regular sleeping pattern and stay away from easily accessible junk foods.</p>
<p>Those snacks may give you a quick energy boost, but sleep is still the best way for your body to recover. There’s no substitute for a deep, body-recovering slumber.</p>
<h3>5. Take the Best Fat-Burning Supplements</h3>
<p><a href="https://sculptnation.com/product/burn-pm/"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-6045 size-large" src="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/vince-burnpm-pl07.png?resize=1024%2C1024&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="1024" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/vince-burnpm-pl07.png?resize=1024%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/vince-burnpm-pl07.png?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 150w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/vince-burnpm-pl07.png?resize=300%2C300&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/vince-burnpm-pl07.png?resize=768%2C768&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/vince-burnpm-pl07.png?resize=60%2C60&amp;ssl=1 60w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/vince-burnpm-pl07.png?w=1080&amp;ssl=1 1080w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>To maximize the results from your fat-burning workout routines, combine every workout with the right supplements. Here’re the ingredients your night time fat-burning supplement needs to have:</p>
<h4>A. Raspberry Ketones</h4>
<p>There are times where we just want to slice our belly open and suck the fat out. While that’s not normally possible, Raspberry Ketones can do something similar.</p>
<p>It’s an ingredient that helps burn fat fast by boosting your metabolism. Raspberry Ketones have been shown in animal studies to help your body eviscerate fat within your body’s cells.</p>
<p>Plus, it produces Adiponectin. This protein plays a vital role in regulating and maintaining healthy metabolic levels.</p>
<p>When paired with effective <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/best-weight-loss-exercises/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">fat-burning exercises</a>, Raspberry Ketones will supercharge your fat loss.</p>
<h4>B. L-Tryptophan</h4>
<p>L-Tryptophan has been scientifically proven to be on of the most powerful natural sleep aids in the world</p>
<p>This important ingredient helps crush Cortisol, and makes it easier to fall into a deep, muscle-building, fat-burning sleep. As a result, you can enjoy better, deeper periods of sleep while maximizing the fat-burning zone.</p>
<p>Sadly, the body doesn’t produce L-Tryptophan.<span>That’s why it’s ultra important to get this powerful ingredient into your body through supplements. Burn PM</span><span class="mobile-p-break"> uses a potent strain of L-Tryptophan to help you get better sleep and improve performance.</span></p>
<h4>C. White Kidney Beans</h4>
<p>Your overall body fat levels increase when your system converts starch into fat. Want to stop your body from converting starches to fat? Exercise helps burn off excess starches from the food you eat, but unfortunately, there will always be some left in your bloodstream.</p>
<p>White Kidney Beans have been proven to help prevent your body from using those extra starches and blocks them from becoming body fat. <span style="font-size: 1rem;">As a result, you can maintain a steady lean, fit weight.</span></p>
<h4>D. Lemon Balm Leaf</h4>
<p>Too many fitness buffs neglect the importance of sleep. While you do need to put in some extra work to achieve your fitness goals, it’s equally important to provide your body with the rest it needs.</p>
<p><span>Lemon Balm Leaf is a powerful natural sleep aid. Remember, sleeping deeply every night helps curb cortisol levels, which helps your body get out of fat-storage mode while turning on your body’s fat-burning machinery. Lemon Balm Leaf is loaded with antioxidants and improves digestion, which can help your body torch fat faster.</span></p>
<p>If you’re having trouble sleeping at night, using a supplement like Burn PM that contains lemon balm leaf will help you get that relaxing, deep slumber every night.</p>
<h4>E. Saffron Flower</h4>
<p>Saffron Flower is loaded with special antioxidants, including crocetin and crocins, that hunt down and destroy fat in your bloodstream. Saffron Flower’s antioxidant blend is so powerful that studies have shown it can support healthy glucose, help with triglycerides, and help lower LDL cholesterol levels in your blood while increasing your body’s energy expenditure and burning fat in your lower body.</p>
<p><span>This means that Saffron Flower can improve your health while helping you lose fat faster by increasing the number of calories your body burns, even while e</span>ven while you’re dozing off to dreamland.</p>
<h4>F. Green Coffee Bean Extract</h4>
<p>If you want to burn belly fat fast, you need to regulate and maintain your insulin and blood sugar levels. When the body produces more insulin, you tend to feel hungrier and the body stores belly fat.</p>
<p>Not even the best fat-burning workouts would have any effect if you have high insulin levels. As such, if you want to <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/get-six-pack/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">sculpt a solid six-pack</a>, you need to keep your insulin levels at bay.</p>
<p>Luckily, Green Coffee Bean Extract contains Chlorogenic Acid which has been shown to keep your insulin levels from spiking and may help keep your blood sugar regulated. It has also been shown to help reduce the amount of fat absorbed from your diet, and reduce the fat stored in your liver by increasing your body’s natural fat burning hormone, adiponectin.</p>
<p>Why not just drink coffee? Unfortunately Chlorogenic Acid is destroyed when coffee is roasted. Luckily, we’ve isolated this powerful fat loss agent and loaded a maximum dose into Burn PM.</p>
<h4>G. Dandelion Root</h4>
<p>We all know how troubling indigestion, constipation, and bloating are. Luckily, you can ease these symptoms by supplementing with dandelion root.</p>
<p>It’s a natural digestive aid people all across the globe have been using for centuries now. Up to today, many use Dandelion Roots to help promote a healthy digestive tract.</p>
<p>Dandelion Roots also provide the body with vitamin A, which is important to maintain a strong, disease-resistant immune system.</p>
<h4>H. Melatonin</h4>
<p>Melatonin is a holistic ingredient that can help you shed fat whether you’re awake or asleep.</p>
<p>Apart from being a potent sleeping aid that helps you achieve a deep, body-healing slumber, it also increases your body’s levels of &#8220;Beige&#8221; fat.</p>
<p>Beige fat increase your body’s thermic-sensitivity to exercise. Quite simply, this fat helps your body shred more fat every time you workout.</p>
<p>Every dose of Burn PM gives your body the Melatonin it needs to help you fall asleep, and increase beneficial Beige Fat.</p>
<h4>I. Vitamin D3 Cholecalciferol</h4>
<p>Fitness is a 24/7 journey, and you have to keep track of your body all the time. That’s why you should find a way to help your body burn fat on its own even during your idle moments.</p>
<p>Otherwise, you limit your fat-burning process to the hours when you’re awake and moving. Luckily, you can increase leptin levels, suppress appetite, and boost metabolism around the clock with vitamin D3.</p>
<p>Vitamin D3 plays a major role in increasing the amount of leptin in the body. That way, there’s more than enough to burn body fat even during your inactive state.</p>
<p>Plus, vitamin D3 signals your brain to curb your appetite. In fact, an Australian study showed that a vitamin D-fortified breakfast can drastically reduce your appetite for the next 24 hours.</p>
<p>This is the perfect supplement for gym-goers who plan to go on a low-calorie, low-carb diet but still need sufficient energy to hit the gym.</p>
<p>If you want to maximize the hard-earned results from the belly fat-burning exercises you routinely do, then you should start taking the right supplements as well. Proper diet and exercise can only take you so far in your fitness journey. Taking supplements that contain all the key ingredients, such as <a href="https://sculptnation.com/product/burn-pm/"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Burn PM</strong></span></a> will help you achieve a fit, lean, well-sculpted body by shedding off unwanted fat even as you sleep.</p>

<h2>Important Greens for a Healthy Diet</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div id="including" class="anchor"></div>
<h3>Including <a href="https://sculptnation.com/product/greens/">Supergreens</a> in Your Meal Plan</h3>
<p>We get it. Eating pounds of green fruits and veggies isn’t easy. Here’s some motivation to getting these supergreens into your diet, how they benefit you, and how you can easily add it to your diet without dreading the taste.</p>
<div id="why" class="anchor"></div>
<h3><strong>Why Supergreens Are</strong><strong> Important for Your Fitness Nutrition</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://sculptnation.com/product/greens/">Supergreens</a> help your fitness nutrition by promoting weight loss, health, and improving your everyday performance. There are a number of green leafy vegetable benefits to take advantage of.</p>
<h3>1. Enhanced Energy</h3>
<p>Some greens are great energy boosters. They are low in calories but contain <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/best-times-eat-carbs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">enough carbohydrates</a> to fuel your energy levels. Their magnesium content can also boost your metabolism to quickly turn your carb intake into energy.</p>
<h3>2. Cleanse and Detoxify</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-5908 size-full" src="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/green-smoothie-drink-healthy-food-greens-pb.jpg?resize=625%2C400&#038;ssl=1" alt="Cleanse and Detoxify | Supergreens Need To Be A Part of Your Diet. Here’s Why (And How)" width="625" height="400" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/green-smoothie-drink-healthy-food-greens-pb.jpg?w=625&amp;ssl=1 625w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/green-smoothie-drink-healthy-food-greens-pb.jpg?resize=300%2C192&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>Most greens are full of antioxidants. Their antioxidants help get rid of the free radicals in your body and aid in the prevention of developing cancer. A green smoothie every 2-3 days is enough to boost your detox diet.</p>
<h3>3. Immunity Support</h3>
<p>Any type of green vegetable contains natural compounds that help support a healthy immune system. The compounds enhance the proper function of immune cells in the gut and skin.</p>
<h3>4. Portable Superfood</h3>
<p>Greens are full of nutrients, especially when you eat them raw. Unlike most foods, greens have higher nutrient contents such as watercress. Including any of these greens in your diet can help you meet a few recommended daily nutrient intake.</p>
<h3>5. Boost Fat Loss</h3>
<p>Greens&#8217; low-calorie content and detoxifying potential help with weight loss. Some also contain nutrients that promote fat burning and help curb your appetite.</p>
<div id="list" class="anchor"></div>
<h3><strong>List of Supergreens and Their Benefits</strong></h3>
<h3>1. Kale</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-5909 size-full" src="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Kale-leafy-greens-vegetable-box-hold-in-hands-greens-ss.jpg?resize=625%2C400&#038;ssl=1" alt="Kale | Supergreens Need To Be A Part of Your Diet. Here’s Why (And How)" width="625" height="400" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Kale-leafy-greens-vegetable-box-hold-in-hands-greens-ss.jpg?w=625&amp;ssl=1 625w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Kale-leafy-greens-vegetable-box-hold-in-hands-greens-ss.jpg?resize=300%2C192&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>Kale is one of the most nutritious greens around. Its fiber content aids digestion and promotes cardiovascular health. It also improves blood glucose levels to help with diabetes, prevent asthma, lower blood pressure, and decrease the risk of developing cancer.</p>
<h3>2. Spinach</h3>
<p>Spinach is second to kale as one of the healthiest supergreens. It has a mild flavor but filled with tons of nutrients. 180 grams of spinach contains about 7 mg of iron.</p>
<h3>3. Beet Greens</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-5910 size-full" src="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/green-beautiful-beet-haulm-greens-ss.jpg?resize=625%2C400&#038;ssl=1" alt="Beet Greens | Supergreens Need To Be A Part of Your Diet. Here’s Why (And How)" width="625" height="400" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/green-beautiful-beet-haulm-greens-ss.jpg?w=625&amp;ssl=1 625w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/green-beautiful-beet-haulm-greens-ss.jpg?resize=300%2C192&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>Beet greens are often taken for granted and thrown into the garbage disposal in favor of the beet root. The greens of this vegetable are actually a type of superfood filled with fiber.</p>
<h3>4. Romaine Lettuce</h3>
<p>The fluffy leaves of romaine lettuce contain high amounts of antioxidants which can help prevent cancer. Its vitamin B content helps fight depression and boost male fertility.</p>
<h3>5. Leaf Lettuce</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-5911 size-full" src="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/M8bpp4qQZGg-leaf-lettuce-greens-us.jpg?resize=625%2C400&#038;ssl=1" alt="Leaf Lettuce | Supergreens Need To Be A Part of Your Diet. Here’s Why (And How)" width="625" height="400" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/M8bpp4qQZGg-leaf-lettuce-greens-us.jpg?w=625&amp;ssl=1 625w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/M8bpp4qQZGg-leaf-lettuce-greens-us.jpg?resize=300%2C192&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>If you don&#8217;t have romaine lettuce, the classic leaf lettuce is just as nutritious. Include two cups of this leaf vegetable in your daily salad to meet your day&#8217;s recommended intake of vitamin K. Vitamin K is an essential nutrient for strong bones and helps promote bone damage.</p>
<h3>6. Chicory</h3>
<p>The ancient Egyptians used Chicory as traditional medicine. Today, it&#8217;s often used to enhance the flavor of coffee. This green is also an appetite stimulant and can help lower your cholesterol levels.</p>
<h3>7. Chinese Cabbage</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-5912 size-full" src="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/White-cabbage-on-wooden-table-greens-ss.jpg?resize=625%2C400&#038;ssl=1" alt="Chinese Cabbage | Supergreens Need To Be A Part of Your Diet. Here’s Why (And How)" width="625" height="400" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/White-cabbage-on-wooden-table-greens-ss.jpg?w=625&amp;ssl=1 625w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/White-cabbage-on-wooden-table-greens-ss.jpg?resize=300%2C192&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>Chinese cabbage can help lower inflammation in women. It can deactivate inflammation markers in your body which also helps lower risks of heart disease.</p>
<h3>8. Parsley</h3>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Here are seven ways how <a href="https://sculptnation.com/product/neuroctane/">NeurOctane</a> and a youthful brain can help you maximize the results from your workout sessions.</p>
<h2>NeurOctane | 7 Reasons Athletes Need Brain Supplements</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>1. Protects Your Brain From Dangerous Radicals</h3>
<p>Taking the best brain supplements such as <a href="https://sculptnation.com/product/neuroctane/">NeurOctane</a> is important to shield ourselves from brain-damaging free-radicals. These compounds are the leading cause of brain degeneration.</p>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> Apart from taking brain vitamins, fitness buffs should supplement with antioxidants as well. Doing so will detox the brain and body leading to better athletic performance.</p>
<p><strong>Free-Radicals:</strong> Dangerous compounds that negatively affect our physical, mental, and emotional health.</p>
<h3>2. Naturally Raises Dopamine and Serotonin Levels</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-5796 size-full" src="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Horizontal-photo-of-attractive-woman-jogging-on-treadmill-at-health-club-neuroctane-ss.jpg?resize=625%2C400&#038;ssl=1" alt="Naturally Raises Dopamine and Serotonin Levels | Reasons Why Your Brain Needs A Boost When You’re Working Out" width="625" height="400" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Horizontal-photo-of-attractive-woman-jogging-on-treadmill-at-health-club-neuroctane-ss.jpg?w=625&amp;ssl=1 625w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Horizontal-photo-of-attractive-woman-jogging-on-treadmill-at-health-club-neuroctane-ss.jpg?resize=300%2C192&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>Keeping a healthy level of serotonin is important to ensure proper body functions. These affect the way our muscles, digestive tract, and cardiovascular system work.</p>
<p><a href="https://sculptnation.com/product/neuroctane/">NeurOctane</a> is one of the best natural stimulants to promote dopamine and serotonin production in the body. A good level of these chemicals will improve the way our mind and body communicate with each other.</p>
<p>Apart from improving overall strength and function, these brain pills also have a positive effect on our mood. With that, athletes can show up at the gym feeling refreshed and motivated no matter what day of the week it is.</p>
<p><strong>Dopamine:</strong> It’s a compound the body naturally produces when we’re feeling happy. High levels of dopamine also improve our cognitive and motor skills. It may lead to better physical, emotional, and mental capabilities.</p>
<p><strong>Serotonin:</strong> This chemical is vital to maintain and improve brain function. It’s responsible for relaying messages from one part of the brain to another.</p>
<h3>3. Boost Your Information Retention</h3>
<p>If you’ve ever had difficulty memorizing multiple chunks of information, then you might need a brain boost. <a href="https://sculptnation.com/product/neuroctane/">NeurOctane</a> is a brain supplement that improves the mind’s ability to retain information.</p>
<p>Whether it’s a new workout routine or important details at work, brain boosters will help you remember them. Try taking <a href="https://sculptnation.com/product/neuroctane/">NeurOctane</a> to improve your short-term memory.</p>
<h3>4. Improve Your Memory</h3>
<p>Long-term memory is just as important as short-term information retention. A poor memory may be the sign of brain degeneration.</p>
<p>As we grow older, both the mind and body need more supplements to maintain peak performance. If you don’t have a healthy mind, how can you expect to be at your absolute best at the gym?</p>
<h3>5. Fight Anxiety and Improve Mood</h3>
<p>Mental health issues such as anxiety and depression can be really troublesome, especially if you can’t pinpoint the reason why you’re feeling down.</p>
<p>However, like any other disease, these all start from our own mind and body. Imbalanced hormone levels generally cause these issues.</p>
<p>Luckily, taking vitamins for the brain may help maintain a healthy balance in the chemicals and hormones in your body. Try taking brain booster supps that increase dopamine and serotonin. These may help alleviate anxiety and depression.</p>
<p><strong>Important:</strong> Mental health problems should never be taken lightly. The best way to conquer them is to start by <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/running-benefits/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cleansing your mind and body</a>.</p>
<p>If you have a toxic body brimming with <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/healthy-eating-mistakes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">unhealthy junk</a>, then your mind will fill itself with negativity as well. Exercising not only leads to a better-looking body, but it also helps promote a healthy mind.</p>
<h3>6. Rapidly Relieve Stress</h3>
<p>We may not realize it, but stress can negatively affect the way we look, think, and perform. Think about it, all your best workout sessions happened because you were having a good day.</p>
<p>On the other hand, working out with a preoccupied mind might even lead to injuries. Start taking brain enhancement supps today to relieve and remedy stress.</p>
<p>Plus, a stressed-out mind produces cortisol, testosterone-sapping hormones. If you want to achieve a lean, fit body, then you need to maintain a healthy level of testosterone.</p>
<p>Using brain health supplements is exactly what we need to relax.</p>
<h3>7. Improve Focus and Alertness</h3>
<p><!-- instagram error: invalid instagram resource --></p>
<p>A top-performing body stems from a focused mind. Taking focus pills is a surefire way to enhance mind IQ and give your body the power it needs to beat your last PR.</p>
<h3>What Ingredients to Look for in Focus Supplements</h3>
<p>Here are some of the ingredients your brain supplement should have:</p>
<h3><strong>1. Bacopa Monnieri</strong></h3>
<p>It’s an amazing neurotropic that helps you dramatically lower your stress levels, alleviate anxiety, and support a positive mood.</p>
<p>At the same time, bacopa monnieri also helps promote normal inflammatory responses and improve both memory and brain function by removing free-radicals in your brain.</p>
<h3><strong>2. EnXtra (Alpinia Galanga Extract)</strong></h3>
<p>It’s an amazing plant extract that acts as a 100% stimulant-free brain supplement. It rapidly increases mental alertness, focus, and energy.</p>
<p>Human studies in the BAOJ Nutrition Journal showed that EnXtra can boost mental alertness and acuity for up to five hours without increasing blood pressure or heart rate. Also, unlike stimulants, this brain boost ingredient does not end in a huge energy crash.</p>
<h3><strong>3. NOOPEPT (N-Phenylacetyl-L-Prolyglycine Ethyl Ester)</strong></h3>
<p>Studies on animals show that this powerful compound can raise the brain’s NGF and BDNF levels. They are both important compounds to improve cognitive function, information retention, and long-term memory recall.</p>
<p><strong>Neurotrophic Growth Factor (NGF): </strong>They play an important role in the regulation of growth, development, maintenance, and division of specific target neurons.</p>
<p><strong>Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF):</strong> These support existing neurons while promoting the growth and production of new neurons and synapses.</p>
<h3><strong>4. Piper Nigrum Fruit Extract 95%</strong></h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-5798 size-full" src="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Black-Pepper-neuroctane-ss.jpg?resize=625%2C400&#038;ssl=1" alt="Piper Nigrum Fruit Extract 95% | Reasons Why Your Brain Needs A Boost When You’re Working Out" width="625" height="400" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Black-Pepper-neuroctane-ss.jpg?w=625&amp;ssl=1 625w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Black-Pepper-neuroctane-ss.jpg?resize=300%2C192&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>This ingredient supports the effectiveness of nootropics in the brain while serving the function of one as well. It acts as an MAO inhibitor to increase your dopamine and serotonin levels.</p>
<p>Also, it’s a potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory supplement that can protect your brain from certain diseases.</p>
<h3><strong>5. L-Theanine</strong></h3>
<p>Hyper-powerful amino acids that can help fight anxiety, relieve stress, increase focus, and improve sleep quality. Studies also show that combining L-theanine with coffee enhances its energizing effects while removing the jitters.</p>
