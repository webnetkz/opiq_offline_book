								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the least likely times, amidst the COVID-19 quarantine, Shady found a lifeline she didn’t even realize she needed. Our V Shred community helped her go from over 250 pounds and unable to play with her kids to an energetic 40-year old that is now on a mission to inspire others. We hope Shady’s V Shred transformation gives you some motivation today!</p>

<h2>Looking For Something More &#8211; Getting Started with V Shred</h2>
<p>Shady is a single mom of two young children that hustles hard, working two jobs to provide for her family.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s hard to believe that this now bubbly and confident 40-year old was almost 70 pounds heavier and battling depression.</p>
<p>At the beginning of 2020, Shady was 252 pounds and in denial.</p>
<blockquote><p>“I felt healthy, but then things started going downhill. My joints were sore, I was having a hard time walking. I couldn&#8217;t go bike riding with the kids. I became lazy and depressed.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Those feelings easily became amplified when COVID-19 hit. After all, she lost her side job in retail, her housecleaning business suffered, and she found herself isolated at home alone with her 2 kids.</p>
<p>But instead of spiraling downward, Shady decided to use her free time to self-reflect. She admitted she had let herself go and took the first step in regaining her health.</p>
<blockquote><p>“I started slowly by walking outside. That gave me the jumpstart. I started to feel better, but I was looking for something more hardcore.”</p></blockquote>
<p>It just so happens that a V Shred ad popped up on Shady’s Facebook page.</p>
<p>She began scrolling and reading transformation stories of women just like her. She instantly knew the V Shred community was exactly the push she needed. She was ready for her own V Shred transformation!</p>
<blockquote><p>“Before I even started day one, I was on the community page, reading these women’s posts of inspiration, and love, and encouragement. It was average women that showed before and afters. Just reading how supportive everybody was, that was a huge part of it for me.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Without hesitation, she downloaded the V Shred app and purchased the <a href="https://vshred.com/sp/fat-loss-extreme-f/sku_CKcwR4TEg54IeG?utm_source=blog-shady&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=female-motivation-testimonial&amp;utm_content=FLE-zee.j&amp;utm_term=5">Fat Loss Extreme program</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>“It kicked my butt! I even felt better after just one day.”</p></blockquote>
<h2>Community Helped Shady&#8217;s V Shred Transformation Mean Something More</h2>
<p>Working out wasn’t unfamiliar territory for Shady. At one time, she was a fitness instructor! It was the dieting part that was foreign. But thanks to the free information in the V Shred app and pointers from thousands of new friends, Shady taught herself how to track macros and eat clean.</p>
<blockquote><p>“I didn’t realize that diet was 80% of it. All the information that you get with the app, it&#8217;s just so helpful and really insightful. It&#8217;s easy to follow and such a good program.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Before long, Shady was no longer reading other women&#8217;s success stories. She had the confidence to post her own inspiring before and after pictures.</p>
<blockquote><p>“It is absolute sister love, it truly is. It&#8217;s like you have connections with these people from all over the world. It&#8217;s incredible.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Shady’s new love for health and fitness also led her to set an example for her two young kids.</p>
<blockquote><p>“My son was only eating Kraft dinners, hot dogs, and garbage food. I was like, you know what guys, you&#8217;re 9 and 10, I want you guys to be healthy for life and not do it as late as I did. We literally went through the entire house and donated everything that we could that was not nutritional.”</p></blockquote>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-7650" src="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/shady-healthy-lifestyle-family.png?resize=1024%2C390&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="390" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/shady-healthy-lifestyle-family.png?resize=1024%2C390&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/shady-healthy-lifestyle-family.png?resize=300%2C114&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/shady-healthy-lifestyle-family.png?resize=768%2C292&amp;ssl=1 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Every day wasn’t easy. There were moments when Shady wanted to quit.</p>
<blockquote><p>“You have those days you just want to stay into the covers and close the blinds and shut everyone out. But then the kids would come into my room and say, mom, let&#8217;s go for a walk!”</p></blockquote>
<p>In just over 3 months, with no gym, only her V Shred app and online community, Shady lost almost 70 pounds! Her physical V Shred transformation even gave her the confidence to join a burlesque dance group and wear a sexy new dress to celebrate turning 40 years young!</p>

I would post pictures on Facebook, and people would ask, what are you doing? Of course, I told them about the <a href="https://vshred.com/sp/fat-loss-extreme-f/sku_CKcwR4TEg54IeG?utm_source=blog-shady&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=female-motivation-testimonial&amp;utm_content=FLE-zee.j&amp;utm_term=5">V Shred program</a>. ”</p></blockquote>
<h2>Setting Her Sights Forward With Everyone She Loves</h2>
<p>Shady now weighs a more healthy 185 pounds and is setting her focus on building lean muscle by incorporating Sculpt Nation supplements and starting the V Shred <a href="https://vshred.com/sp/toned-in-90-days/v1/?utm_source=blog-shady&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=female-motivation-testimonial&amp;utm_content=FLE-zee.j&amp;utm_term=5">Toned In 90 Days</a> and <a href="https://vshred.com/sp/the-booty-builder/v1/?utm_source=blog-shady&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=female-motivation-testimonial&amp;utm_content=FLE-zee.j&amp;utm_term=5">BootyBuilder</a> programs.</p>
<p>Shady is excited to see just how far new love for fitness can take her, but more than a better body, she just wants her journey to continue to inspire and motivate others to start or continue their own V Shred transformation.</p>
<blockquote><p>“The fact that I&#8217;ve inspired people and it&#8217;s really crazy. It gives me goosebumps. My friends are just like, what are you doing? I want to feel the way you feel. I want to continue to give that to people and inspire people and make them feel good. That&#8217;s all I want.”</p></blockquote>

<p>When exercise becomes a convenient habit, transformations become possible. In August 2019, Deborah, 40, of Inez, TX came back to work after a week off due to nerve damage in her back. The other waitresses in the restaurant where she worked had started a small weight loss challenge. The winner amongst them would get the prize pool from each person’s $5 buy in plus a gift card for matching that total. It wasn’t much, but Deborah figured what the heck…and now her V Shred transformation is inspiring others!</p>
<p><em>“I put money in and signed up, but I was convinced I wouldn’t lose weight so I just kept doing what I normally did.”</em> she explained.</p>
<p>After a couple weeks, as some of the other waitresses started to lose a few initial pounds Deborah saw a photo of herself and did not like what was looking back at her.</p>
<p><em>“Man was it an eye opener.”</em></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-7636" src="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Deb-before-blog.png?resize=1024%2C1024&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="1024" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Deb-before-blog.png?resize=1024%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Deb-before-blog.png?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 150w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Deb-before-blog.png?resize=300%2C300&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Deb-before-blog.png?resize=768%2C768&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Deb-before-blog.png?resize=60%2C60&amp;ssl=1 60w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Deb-before-blog.png?w=1080&amp;ssl=1 1080w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>The very next day she signed up for a gym membership with a friend. As they both consistently went to the gym after dropping the kids off at school at eating healthier, she started to notice results.</p>
<p><em>“Within a month I lost 9 pounds! With the busy schedules of kids and work I didn’t want to be stressed about work outs and food.”</em></p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Finding Fat Loss Extreme for Women &#8211; Starting A V Shred Transformation</h2>
<p>It was a good start, but as a busy working mother of 3, Deborah knew she needed something more straightforward and structured.</p>
<p><em>“I needed someone to tell me what workouts to do on what days, how many reps, when to rest, and FOR SURE what to eat. Counting macros was not in the cards for me and didn’t have to be. With V Shred its all done for me and works. I love all of it!!”</em> she described, looking back on her V Shred transformation.</p>
<p>Deborah first got started with the <a href="https://vshred.com/sp/fat-loss-extreme-f/sku_CKcwR4TEg54IeG?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=socialmedia&amp;utm_campaign=female-motivation-testimonial&amp;utm_content=Product-Author&amp;utm_term=5">Fat Loss Extreme for Her</a> program. Once she completed the initial 90 days she switched to the <a href="https://vshred.com/sp/ripped-in-90-days/sku_AR6nTj3PTK3uu9?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=socialmedia&amp;utm_campaign=female-motivation-testimonial&amp;utm_content=Product-Author&amp;utm_term=5">Ripped In 90 Days</a> program, and now does a regular combination of the two.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-7629" src="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/before-after-f-sc-225.jpg?resize=1024%2C1024&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="1024" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/before-after-f-sc-225.jpg?resize=1024%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/before-after-f-sc-225.jpg?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 150w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/before-after-f-sc-225.jpg?resize=300%2C300&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/before-after-f-sc-225.jpg?resize=768%2C768&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/before-after-f-sc-225.jpg?resize=60%2C60&amp;ssl=1 60w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/before-after-f-sc-225.jpg?w=1080&amp;ssl=1 1080w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><em>“I was never involved in working out or eating healthy ever.”</em> Deborah explained. <em>“After starting V Shred my body was constantly changing for the better and I now see muscles I didn’t know I had! I keep going then pushing harder.”</em></p>
<p>Throughout 2020 Deborah was able to continue her exercises at the gym, despite COVID closures in other parts of Texas. Her success inspired her to close in a patio at home, and like many, create her own home gym.</p>
<p><em>“It has everything I need except a stair stepper and a couple of leg machines.”</em></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-7630" src="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/ezgif-2-f58715b67360.gif?resize=1080%2C410&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1080" height="410" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><em>“With the home gym and all of V Shred’s programs, I have plenty to do. I also purchased <a href="https://vshred.com/sp/move?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=socialmedia&amp;utm_campaign=female-motivation-testimonial&amp;utm_content=Product-Author&amp;utm_term=5">V Shred&#8217;s MOVE Program</a> during quarantine! As far as nutrition, I kept making my meal plans [with my V Shred Trainer] and sticking with the diet. We have a garden to grow our own vegetables, have 10 chickens for fresh eggs, and a pond stocked with catfish and perch which are just now getting big enough to eat.”</em></p>
<p>Once her weight loss results were noticeable from diet and exercise alone Deborah started implementing SculptNation supplements to gain that extra edge on her already active day to day life.</p>
<p><em>“When Sculpt Nation has their <a href="https://sculptnation.com/products/fat-loss-stack?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=socialmedia&amp;utm_campaign=female-motivation-testimonial&amp;utm_content=Product-Author&amp;utm_term=5">40% off sales</a> I stock up 3-6 months in advance… My closet is kind of like a supplement store.”</em> Deborah mused.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">A True V Shred Transformation &#8211; From Tired &amp; Injured to Proud &amp; Self-Sufficient</h2>
<p>From the support Deborah received from family and friends, she also had a bit of a wakeup call. Well past the initial challenge with coworkers, others were noticing her body composition change, her improved attitude, and her enthusiasm for helping others. As people started asking her questions, she knew helping others transform into happy and proud versions of themselves (like she had) was something she wanted to do.</p>
<p><em>“My mom saw my weight loss and started training with me. She got down 30 pounds in 3 months! My 4 year old wants to eat what I eat so he can have muscles. My 13 year old loves going to the gym with me. My husband constantly tells me how proud of me he is. They’ve all supported me 100%!”</em></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-7633" src="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Deb-progress2.png?resize=1024%2C1024&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="1024" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Deb-progress2.png?resize=1024%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Deb-progress2.png?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 150w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Deb-progress2.png?resize=300%2C300&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Deb-progress2.png?resize=768%2C768&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Deb-progress2.png?resize=60%2C60&amp;ssl=1 60w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>Now Deborah is returning the favor!</p>
<p><em>“Now that I have been on this journey I know that I absolutely want to help people to hit their personal goals and feel happy and proud of themselves inside and out.”</em></p>
<p>Deborah has enrolled in the ACE personal training certification program. At age 40 with new goals and dreams she’s working to become certified as a trainer, nutritionist, and youth fitness coach to help kids get on the right track early, as she now has been able to help her family do.</p>
<p>This fall Deborah competed in an online competition to be featured on <a href="https://mshealthandfitness.com/2020/deborah-mcdaniel?utm_source=vshred-blog&amp;utm_medium=socialmedia&amp;utm_campaign=female-motivation-testimonial&amp;utm_content=Product-Author&amp;utm_term=5">Ms Health And Fitness</a> and finished in the top 10!</p>
<h2>Giving Back Fitness Motivation</h2>
<p>When Deborah was asked about how community plays a part in a fitness journey and her personal V Shred transformation she mentioned her success was all about the support she received. Motivating loved ones, professional guidance, and a community of like minded individuals help make personal transformations possible.</p>
<p><em>“My experience with Vshred has been life changing. When it comes to my fitness journey I am proud that I stuck to it even when I didn’t want to. The Vshred for women Facebook page is amazing, all the support and transformation are awesome!”</em></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-7568" src="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/43707f0c562bc5957a2488cd1a9fd5322a9e2de0.jpg?resize=1024%2C768&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="768" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/43707f0c562bc5957a2488cd1a9fd5322a9e2de0.jpg?resize=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/43707f0c562bc5957a2488cd1a9fd5322a9e2de0.jpg?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/43707f0c562bc5957a2488cd1a9fd5322a9e2de0.jpg?resize=768%2C576&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/43707f0c562bc5957a2488cd1a9fd5322a9e2de0.jpg?w=1440&amp;ssl=1 1440w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><em>“I never even thought of going to the gym and eating healthy, but now want to help others do it. If V Shred wouldn’t have been such an amazing program I probably would have stopped a long time ago!”</em></p>
<p>The V Shred Team is so proud of Deborah’s journey and cannot wait to see her help others build active and healthy lifestyles. Her’s is a unique, and lifelong journey. Shred on!</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Most successful weight-loss transformation stories start with an “aha” moment. That sudden shift in mindset that pushes someone to stop coming up with every reason why they can’t do something and instead take the first step towards making a lasting change.</p>
<p>Dylan’s personal story of tragedy, and weight loss then muscle-gain triumph with V Shred will inspire you.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-7526 size-full" src="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/117163427_4254430027932957_2001345014807689283_n.jpg?resize=960%2C960&#038;ssl=1" alt="Dylan's V Shred weight-loss transformation before, during, after photo" width="960" height="960" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/117163427_4254430027932957_2001345014807689283_n.jpg?w=960&amp;ssl=1 960w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/117163427_4254430027932957_2001345014807689283_n.jpg?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 150w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/117163427_4254430027932957_2001345014807689283_n.jpg?resize=300%2C300&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/117163427_4254430027932957_2001345014807689283_n.jpg?resize=768%2C768&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/117163427_4254430027932957_2001345014807689283_n.jpg?resize=60%2C60&amp;ssl=1 60w" sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>For 28-year-old Dylan, his “aha” moment was a combination of his own life set-backs that resulted in weight gain and depression. When those were coupled with the sudden loss of his brother and surviving a natural disaster (on the same day) he knew it was time for a change.</p>
<p>Dylan grew up a football star. Everything was going as planned through high school until he lost a university scholarship and his dreams were crushed. <em>“I went to work, came home, and sat in front of the TV. That was pretty much it.”</em> for years after, explains Dylan.</p>
<p>At an unhealthy 355 pounds, the mental and physical misery Dylan felt every day still wasn’t enough to push him to do something about it. The depression told him he was too far gone. <em>“I didn’t go out because I hated the way I looked. I wouldn’t take my shirt off, even for my girlfriend. It was hard because I used to be this person that was athletic and outgoing. I knew I let myself go, but I thought at that point, there was no fixing it.”</em></p>
<p>The year 2017 was a dark period and the lowest point of Dylan’s life. He saw he was headed in the same direction as someone else he loved. “<em>My brother had depression and substance abuse issues. He was even bigger than I was, and his depression was brought on by his weight. He wasn&#8217;t happy with himself.”</em></p>
<h2>A Day That Changed Everything</h2>
<p>On September 10, 2017 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Irma">Hurricane Irma</a> hit Dylan’s home state of Florida. On the very same day his brother committed suicide. <em>“I swore at that moment, I wasn&#8217;t going to turn into that.”</em></p>
<p>It was the perfect storm to create a lightning bolt moment (his aha.) Dylan knew he had to make a change. His life depended on it.</p>
<p>Scared, and even a little intimidated, Dylan decided to take the first step of his weight-loss transformation. “I&#8217;d seen V Shred almost every single day for two weeks, and I finally clicked the ad, and it was the best thing I ever did.”</p>
<h2>Starting A Weight-Loss Transformation With V Shred</h2>
<p>The former football star knew <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/strength-training/">how to lift weights</a> with a coach screaming down his neck, but had no clue how to workout by himself. Being in the gym, alone, without a coach or teammates was entirely different. As he started to learn more about nutrition in those early days Dylan also realized he didn’t have the slightest clue about cardio or nutrition.</p>
<p>Thankfully, he didn’t have to learn everything alone. The <a href="https://vshred.com/programs/fat-loss-extreme?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=male-motivation-testimonial&amp;utm_content=FLE-male-zee.j&amp;utm_term=5">V Shred Fat Loss Extreme</a> plan laid everything out for him. He simply had to put in the work. <em>“I had an extreme goal. I wanted to lose a hundred pounds within a year. I blew that out the water. I got on pace to where I already knew I was going to hit my goal, and I just kept going.”</em></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-7596 size-full" src="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/24AC0918-158B-4FCE-9E61-6D7A1EE801B0_1_201_a.jpeg?resize=750%2C870&#038;ssl=1" alt="Dylan's V Shred Fat Loss Extreme weight-loss transformation After photo" width="750" height="870" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/24AC0918-158B-4FCE-9E61-6D7A1EE801B0_1_201_a.jpeg?w=750&amp;ssl=1 750w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/24AC0918-158B-4FCE-9E61-6D7A1EE801B0_1_201_a.jpeg?resize=259%2C300&amp;ssl=1 259w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>Dylan also found a lot of help from the V Shred community online, which gave him support and new ideas for exercises and <a href="https://vshred.com/sp/recipe-guide/v1?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=socialmedia&amp;utm_campaign=male-motivation-testimonial&amp;utm_content=FLE-male-zee.j&amp;utm_term=5">recipes</a>. <em>“The V Shred Group “is like Google! It’s constantly refreshing itself for me. Everybody’s in the same mindset that I&#8217;m in, searching without me even having to search.”</em></p>
<p>In his first year with V Shred, Dylan dropped 135 pounds. But his transformation didn’t stop there. He got all the way down to 180 pounds!</p>
<p>After a grand total of 155 pounds lost, Dylan decided to end his weight loss journey, but not in the way you may think.</p>
<h2>Changing His Goals &amp; Changing His Mindset</h2>
<p>Dylan decided to do something that may have been even harder than the initial weight loss.</p>
<p>He started <a href="https://vshred.com/programs/clean-bulk-program?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=socialmedia&amp;utm_campaign=male-motivation-testimonial&amp;utm_content=FLE-male-zee.j&amp;utm_term=5">V Shred&#8217;s Clean Bulk Program</a> to build the muscle needed to reshape his new skinnier body. <em>“I developed body dysmorphia. I became afraid of eating too much. So going from losing all that weight to knowing I have to eat in a surplus and gain weight was a struggle for me.”</em></p>
<p>Dylan quickly learned that his V Shred coaches knew what they were doing. They had a weight-loss transformation plan that would allow him to build muscle without gaining a ton of excess fat.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-7597 size-full" src="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/0AF6A317-A447-4CC1-AEDB-18CA271B8EF2_1_201_a.jpeg?resize=750%2C744&#038;ssl=1" alt="Dylan's V Shred Clean Bulk weight-loss transformation and muscle gain After photo" width="750" height="744" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/0AF6A317-A447-4CC1-AEDB-18CA271B8EF2_1_201_a.jpeg?w=750&amp;ssl=1 750w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/0AF6A317-A447-4CC1-AEDB-18CA271B8EF2_1_201_a.jpeg?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 150w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/0AF6A317-A447-4CC1-AEDB-18CA271B8EF2_1_201_a.jpeg?resize=300%2C298&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/0AF6A317-A447-4CC1-AEDB-18CA271B8EF2_1_201_a.jpeg?resize=60%2C60&amp;ssl=1 60w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>After a 3 year journey with V Shred, Dylan sits at 210 pounds of lean muscle.</p>
<p>But the external transformation is only half of his life-changing results. Dylan is a new man both inside and out. He has developed confidence and a fresh zest for the life he shares with his fiancé and two kids.</p>
<p>Dylan’s weight-loss transformation, however, hasn’t come without setbacks. COVID limitations made it hard to hit heavy weights, and over Labor Day weekend, he had an accident that dislodged two ribs!</p>
<p>Instead of getting down about not being able to lift heavy enough to continue his bulk, he shifted his mindset. Dylan decided that he would attempt his very first “cut” using <a href="https://vshred.com/sp/ripped-in-90-days/sku_AR6nTj3PTK3uu9?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=male-motivation-testimonial&amp;utm_content=FLE-male-zee.j&amp;utm_term=5">V Shred Ripped In 90 Days</a>. We can’t wait to see his next set of transformation pictures!!</p>
<p>Dylan&#8217;s advice to anyone scared of or too hesitant to purchase a plan is this …</p>
<p><em>“Everyone asks me “the secret”. You have the basic responses; diet is key and hit the gym hard. But those are common knowledge. <strong>There is one thing that is going to get you the results you want &#8211; eliminate the excuses!</strong> The “I’m tired., I’ll go harder tomorrow” or “I can’t find the time” won’t work, and will only hold you back. V Shred is a building block (and an amazing one at that). With all the information, the support, and this group, you 100% can achieve your goal. Get grinding guys, and keep reaching your goals and making new ones!”</em></p>
