That is a scary number!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Good thing you found this article because </span><b><i>we aren’t going to let YOU be “most” people! </i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lower temps do not have to equal larger waistlines! You just have to have a plan! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this short read we will &#8230;</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Explain why winter weight gain happens. Knowing why is important if you want to prevent it and the reason is probably not what you think. In fact, it is partially not even your fault!</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tell you why fall/winter is actually the BEST time to start a diet and training plan.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Give you 7 easy pro tips that will help guide you through the next few months. </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You may believe winter weight gain happens because of the holidays. Those extra home cooked meals and holiday parties are certainly a factor. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But </span><b><i>there is a DAILY issue you need to be prepared to fight </i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">if you want to avoid packing on winter pounds.</span></p>
<p><b>WHY YOU REALLY PACK ON POUNDS AFTER LABOR DAY</b></p>
<p><img class="size-large wp-image-7471" src="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_130930953.jpeg?resize=1024%2C512&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="512" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_130930953.jpeg?resize=1024%2C512&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_130930953.jpeg?resize=300%2C150&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_130930953.jpeg?resize=768%2C384&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_130930953.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_130930953.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the spring and summer months, you are given what we call a</span><b> fitness freebie. </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You get a </span><b><i>seasonal motivation boost</i></b> <span style="font-weight: 400;">that doesn’t happen when temperatures start to drop, and you begin to pull out the chunky sweaters and comfy leggings. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not only is the sun shining (which makes you happier because of Vitamin D), you are wearing LESS clothing in the summer months. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I don’t know about you, but knowing I’m going to be exposing more skin makes walking in the gym a little easier. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Covering up in layers, no doubt leads to the temptation to slack on body goals! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Knowing your arms, legs, and abs will be less exposed can easily be an excuse to slack. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, being layered up often means you don’t SEE the extra pounds, so they are easier to ignore.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But there is more to it than being bundled up….</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-7477" src="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_236518834.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_236518834.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_236518834.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_236518834.jpeg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_236518834.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_236518834.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span>The #1 reason you slack on health and fitness goals in colder months ISN’T EVEN YOUR FAULT!!</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, you have a part to play in all of this, but</span><b><i> there is actually a scientific reason why you have less desire to train and eat healthy when the sunshine of summer fades.</i></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We will explain why a little further down. But ya know what really stinks? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The scientific reason why we all experience these motivation slumps in the winter only adds to an even bigger issue with motivation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span>It doesn’t matter what season it is motivation ALWAYS comes and goes!</p>
<p>Spring, Summer, Fall, or Winter &#8211; you can NEVER rely on it!</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, what can you do when lack of sunshine and warm temps leave you even more tempted to hit snooze and reach for comfort foods? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You certainly don’t throw your hands up in the air and wait until January to make a resolution to crash diet to get your body ready for spring. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Believe it or not, RIGHT NOW is actually the IDEAL time to get started! </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you </span><b><i>START NOW, </i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">you will develop discipline and a routine heading into the holidays. This will put you in a great place mentally and physically to relax and “indulge” a little more at all those holiday gatherings! </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><b><i>Look at it this way ..<br />
</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Would you rather head into the holiday season already making progress toward your goals and be in a great spot <em>(where it would be okay even if you did gain an extra pound or two?)</em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Or would you rather put it off and only add more fat on top of what you want to lose?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The answer is clear— the solution to getting the motivation needed to make it happen, not so much.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But don’t worry! We’ve got ya covered</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (no pun intended)</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with a few easy motivation hacks!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><b>7 TIPS TO STAY MOTIVATED AS SEASONS CHANGE</b></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><b><br />
</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the number one questions we always get is … “<em>I am just not motivated. How can I motivate myself to train and eat better?”</em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As we mentioned earlier, it doesn&#8217;t matter what season it is, </span><b><i>you can’t always rely on motivation. </i></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you have it, great! You should certainly take advantage of it! But you have to know that it is totally normal to not have much of it. Even professional athletes lack motivation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You have to develop other daily habits that create discipline if you want to succeed long term!</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are a few of our pro tips that we use with our clients, specifically when temperatures drop, and motivation seems to be at its lowest! </span></p>
<p><b>TIP #1: Switch To An At Home Training Program</b></p>
<p><img class="size-large wp-image-7448" src="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_185038762.jpeg?resize=1024%2C647&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="647" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_185038762.jpeg?resize=1024%2C647&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_185038762.jpeg?resize=300%2C189&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_185038762.jpeg?resize=768%2C485&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_185038762.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_185038762.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you know that getting out of bed and stepping into the winter elements is going to be an excuse trigger, make a plan to train at home during cooler months! Some of the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">most effective and challenging workouts </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">only require your body weight and </span><b><i>maybe</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a set of dumbbells or some resistance bands.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A good fat-blasting, muscle-building sweat session can 100% be achieved from the comfort of your home!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adjustable dumbbells, ankle weights, resistance bands, a jump rope, etc., are all things that are inexpensive and can easily be stored in a closet or under your bed and pulled out anytime you don’t feel like leaving the house.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But if you have </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">the right training program</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><b><i>you don’t need any of that. </i></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our favorite </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">at-home bodyweight-only program</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is called</span><b> MOVE. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was designed to help you achieve your fitness goals without a single piece of equipment, and each workout is under 20 minutes! </span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Learn more about MOVE by watching the video below!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you need </span><b>a little extra “nudge”</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to get up and get moving, another </span><b>pro-tip we use</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is keeping some </span><a href="https://sculptnation.com/products/pre-workout" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><b>PRE WORKOUT </b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">on your bedside table. Have it already blended up and chug it as soon as your alarm goes off!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By the time you have brushed your teeth and put on your workout clothes, you will have a nice little jolt of energy and</span><b><i> tons of motivation</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to get going before you have a chance to come up with an excuse! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the bottom of this article, we will tell you about a big end of summer sale happening so that you can stock up on our </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">favorite </span><a href="https://sculptnation.com/products/pre-workout" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><b>PRE WORKOUT</b></a><strong> for 40% off when you use code: LABORDAY40 at checkout! </strong></p>
<p><b>TIP #2: Make Your Workouts Seasonal</b></p>
<p><img class="size-large wp-image-7452" src="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_65703942.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_65703942.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_65703942.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_65703942.jpeg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_65703942.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_65703942.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Embrace the change of seasons and take advantage of activities that you can only do in fall or winter! </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Go on a fall hike and view all the gorgeous foliage.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Try rock climbing.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Walk around a corn maze or pumpkin patch with your family. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you live in a snowy climate, go skiing, sledding, build snowmen with your kids, etc.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Go ice skating.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lace-up your sneakers, go for a walk or run at night, and admire all the Christmas lights and decorations.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are some things you can only do and see during specific times of the year. So instead of missing sunshine and water sports, focus on all the positive things that only come about with cooler temps!</span></p>
<p><b>TIP #3: Try Something Totally New</b></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-7454" src="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_361152601.jpeg?resize=1024%2C514&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="514" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_361152601.jpeg?resize=1024%2C514&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_361152601.jpeg?resize=300%2C151&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_361152601.jpeg?resize=768%2C386&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_361152601.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_361152601.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sometimes a change of routine is all you need to boost motivation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you have been doing all your gym lifts alone, recruit a gym buddy! Try switching up your cardio by skipping your solo runs and joining a group fitness class instead. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another option is to </span><b><i>allow yourself to slow down!</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> If you have been crushing it all spring and summer with intense training and hardcore workouts, </span><b><i>it may actually be time to take it down a notch. </i></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Going full force 365 can cause your stress hormone cortisol to increase. This can lead to a host of drawbacks, including weight gain, muscle loss, poor moods, fatigue, and occasional issues sleeping! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We aren’t saying you should become lazy! But if you have been crushing it 24/7 all spring and summer, your body (and mind) may need to slow down.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Use the next few months to embrace a slower routine. </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Commit to daily yoga.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Focus on becoming more flexible.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Switch to low or moderate-intensity cardio, instead of HIIT.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Try out some bodyweight workouts instead of heavy lifting.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Giving your body a couple of months to recover might even make you more responsive when you decide to kick things up again come spring/summer!</span></p>
<p><b>TIP #4: Stay Accountable</b></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-7457" src="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_266584820.jpeg?resize=1024%2C768&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="768" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_266584820.jpeg?resize=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_266584820.jpeg?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_266584820.jpeg?resize=768%2C576&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_266584820.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_266584820.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><b><br />
</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">The best way to stick to a plan is to have someone that you report back to. This could be a friend, family member, a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">social media community</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, or even a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">coach. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Including someone else, or even just telling someone else about your health and fitness goals and asking them to check in with you to make sure you are sticking to the plan, is a great way to keep the promises you make to yourself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you prefer to fly solo, it helps to create visuals. Make a vision board, create a daily checklist you can mark off after each workout, or keep an accomplishment journal.</span></p>
<p><b>TIP #5: Set A Spring Goal</b></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-7458" src="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_47332240.jpeg?resize=1024%2C680&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="680" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_47332240.jpeg?resize=1024%2C680&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_47332240.jpeg?resize=300%2C199&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_47332240.jpeg?resize=768%2C510&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_47332240.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_47332240.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">March may seem like a long time away, but it will be back before you know it, and 6 months is a long time to make significant changes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Setting a goal is a great way to encourage yourself to push past discomforts and temptation, but there is a science to goal setting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The key to creating goals that stick .. </span><b><i>be REALISTIC and SPECIFIC!</i></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s start with </span><b><i>reality. </i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">You should always focus on one goal at a time and make sure you are being honest with yourself if that goal is really attainable.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you know that your schedule will never allow you to work out 6 days a week, why would you choose a program that requires you to do that?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you know it’s not healthy to attempt to lose 10 pounds a week, why would you aim that high?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you love carbs, why would you go on a KETO diet? </span></p>
<p><b><i>Doing these things will essentially set yourself up for failure.</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Set attainable goals that fit YOUR lifestyle. You can always bump things up if your schedule allows, or you notice you aren’t pushing yourself hard enough. Just keep in mind that being realistic isn’t the same as not believing in yourself or making excuses. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moving on to being </span><b><i>specific.</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The more specific you are about your goals, the more likely you will be to reach them. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It may seem like it’s good enough to say things like .. I want to look good, lose weight, or get ripped! </span><b><i>But you have to dig deeper than that!! </i></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wanting to “lose weight,” for example, is an excellent place to start. But ask yourself what that means to you?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you expand on that and say &#8212; “I want to lose 10 pounds of fat. I will do this by not eating any sweets and doing the V Shred </span><a href="https://vshred.com/sp/move/soc-all/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><b>MOVE </b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">program for 30 consecutive days. I am doing this because I want to have better self-esteem and a head start on bikini season.” &#8212; that makes your goal more specific.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The more specific (and attainable) your goals are, the more likely you will be to not give up!</span></p>
<p><b>TIP #6: Reward Yourself</b></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-7459" src="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/vin_sant_32048508_366936073798151_433609263865135104_n.jpg?resize=882%2C1024&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="882" height="1024" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/vin_sant_32048508_366936073798151_433609263865135104_n.jpg?resize=882%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 882w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/vin_sant_32048508_366936073798151_433609263865135104_n.jpg?resize=258%2C300&amp;ssl=1 258w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/vin_sant_32048508_366936073798151_433609263865135104_n.jpg?resize=768%2C892&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/vin_sant_32048508_366936073798151_433609263865135104_n.jpg?w=1080&amp;ssl=1 1080w" sizes="(max-width: 882px) 100vw, 882px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you have checked a “mini goal” off your list, treat yourself. Knowing that you have a reward coming to celebrate your efforts will make you want to achieve it even more. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It may be tempting to make your reward one of your favorite “forbidden foods” but we never suggest that you reward yourself this way.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You aren’t a dog. You should never reward “good behavior” with food. Having this mentality can create a really unhealthy relationship with food.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You need to eat healthy MOST of the time, control your portions, and see food as fuel. But if you are craving something that isn’t quite as healthy as your grilled chicken and rice, never feel like you need to lose 20 pounds to “deserve” a bite of cake, or nice dinner out with your family. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instead of rewarding yourself with food, buy yourself something you have been wanting. Maybe some new workout clothes, a massage, or an extra $20 bucks in your vacation fund! </span></p>

<p><b>TIP #7: Make Mental Health Top Priority</b></p>
<p><img class="size-large wp-image-7460" src="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_255894146.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_255894146.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_255894146.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_255894146.jpeg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_255894146.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_255894146.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Earlier, we mentioned that cold weather motivation dips may not be your fault.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’m sure you have heard of winter blues. Well, it’s a real thing. Less natural light can cause dips in serotonin, the neurotransmitter that regulates mood.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The dark and dreary days of winter can also cause your body to produce more of the sleep hormone melatonin. This shift can disrupt your body and impact your sleep patterns and overall mood.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are a few ways that you can focus on improving your mental health.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Invest in a light therapy box that simulates natural daylight.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Make sure you are supplementing with or eating plenty of foods with Vitamin D.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Start journaling. There is a lot of scientific evidence that supports putting your thoughts on paper provides a long list of benefits, including stress management, self-confidence, and goal setting. </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Suppose you still find yourself struggling with negative seasonal motivation shifts. In that case, you may need to experiment with taking</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> naturally sourced herbs</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to help support brain health and a positive mood.</span></p>
<p><b><i>Here are a few with some great scientific backing to help boost mood.</i></b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>EnXtra: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">A natural caffeine-free patent-pending botanical ingredient that has been shown to help increase dopamine levels.**It is also one of the first and only natural caffeine-free patent-pending botanical ingredients shown to boost mental alertness &amp; acuity for hours or ending in a huge caffeine energy crash.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Piper Nigrum Fruit Extract:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> A very specific type of black pepper that has been shown to help increase both serotonin and dopamine.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>L-Theanine:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> A powerful amino acid that is believed to help reduce occasional anxiety brought on by stressful situations.</span></li>
</ul>

<p><b><i>BOTTOM LINE IF YOU WANT TO STAY MOTIVATED YEAR ROUND</i></b><b><i><br />
</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you put away the shorts and swimsuits and shift out of bikini season, it’s common for motivation to “fall back” with the clocks. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The seasons have to change (unless you live near the equator) &#8211; so you have to figure out ways to</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">not let your fitness goals go into hibernation mode!</span><b><i> </i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pumpkin spice lattes are only here for a limited time, but getting into shape isn’t seasonal! </span><i>It&#8217;s a year-round commitment!!</i><i> </i></p>

<p>Motherhood is a mix of many things….<br />
It is a blessing, but it can also be frustrating, hectic, and at times, even monotonous.<br />
It is beautiful knowing that you are helping shape a future generation, but that also brings about a lot of pressure and responsibility.</p>
<p>You are always going mentally and physically, which means just like any other job, burnout is bound to happen<em><strong> if you don’t s-l-o-w down!!</strong></em></p>
<p>If you are a mom reading this… we want you to ask yourself a few important questions.</p>
<ul>
<li>When is the last time I put my needs first?</li>
<li>Do I regularly focus on self-care?</li>
<li>Do I have a good mom/life balance?</li>
</ul>
<p>You likely answered…</p>
<ul>
<li>Rarely/Never</li>
<li>No, not regularly.</li>
<li>What is life .. outside of being a mom?</li>
</ul>
<p>Being a mom has required responsibilities, but you have to stop and think about <em><strong>your own needs</strong></em>. Going non-stop can take a toll on both your mental and physical health.</p>
<p>How can you be SUPERMOM if you aren’t taking time to REST and RECHARGE?</p>
<p><strong>Easier said than done, right?</strong><br />
It SOUNDS great to be able to pour a glass of wine, put on a face mask, jump in a bubble bath, and turn on a meditation app.</p>
<p>In REALITY, you haven’t had time to go to the store to get groceries, your kid’s toys are still in the tub that you haven’t had time to clean, and if you do manage to hop in, forget silence. It won’t be long before there is a little knock at the door, interrupting your zen!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>BUT MOMS… LISTEN UP!</strong></p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-7087" src="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_221068765.jpeg?resize=1170%2C780&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1170" height="780" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_221068765.jpeg?w=6500&amp;ssl=1 6500w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_221068765.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_221068765.jpeg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_221068765.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_221068765.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_221068765.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1170px) 100vw, 1170px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>To be able to take care of everyone else, you have to feel your best both physically and mentally.</p>
<p>Self-care is not selfish .. it’s actually the opposite.<em><strong> A happy and fulfilled mom .. is no doubt a better mom!</strong></em></p>
<p>Use Mother’s Day as a reminder that YOU ARE SPECIAL and deserve just as much TLC as everyone else in your family!</p>
<p>Here are FIVE IDEAS that will help give you the mental and physical energy needed to tackle both the chaos and glory that make up motherhood!!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>5 Ways To Focus On Self-Care This Mother’s Day</strong></p>
<p>Self-Care is a personal process. What helps you unwind may be different than what helps somebody else de-stress. However, these 5 self-care tips are things ALL busy moms should consider.</p>
<p>Remember, self-care isn’t just a day at the spa or date night without the kids.<br />
It is ANY activity you do that will improve your mental, spiritual, and physical health.</p>
<p>In fact, the best types of self-care aren’t about only feeling good in the moment. Just like your health and fitness journey… the ultimate goal of self-care should be its long-term effects!</p>
<p><strong>1: DISCONNECT</strong></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-7088" src="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_338261185.jpeg?resize=1170%2C780&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1170" height="780" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_338261185.jpeg?w=7776&amp;ssl=1 7776w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_338261185.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_338261185.jpeg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_338261185.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_338261185.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_338261185.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1170px) 100vw, 1170px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>Put your computer away, turn off your phone, don’t tune into the news, and click out of Netflix.</p>
<p>Sometimes the most effective thing you can do for yourself has little to do with what TO DO and more to do with what you DO NOT DO!</p>
<p>While it is great to be informed and socially connected .. <em><strong>too much time plugged in can add to your stress, anxiety, and life fears.</strong></em></p>
<p>This is especially true for social media. It is one thing if you <em><strong>only</strong></em> follow accounts that motivate you and feed you with positivity. But many of us “follow” the lives of others and end up comparing, leading to feelings of not being good enough.</p>
<p>Social media can also be a rabbit hole of negativity and biased opinions, leaving you confused, negative, anxious, uptight, and even angry. <em><strong>Put yourself on a social media diet and limit your screen-time and scrolling.</strong></em></p>
<p>The same “digital detox” rules should also apply for TV time. The news (especially these days) can only fuel your fears.<em><strong> If you must watch, tune in only to be informed and immediately power off!</strong></em></p>
<p>If binge-watching Netflix is how you like to unwind, go for it! But the next time you have watched enough episodes for it to ask you &#8211; “are you still watching” &#8211; consider doing something else relaxing that could be more beneficial to your long term mental health.</p>
<p>Take up a new hobby you would enjoy, journal, call a friend, read a book, maybe even try those “stress relieving” adult coloring books!</p>
<p><strong>2: GET REGULAR SLEEP</strong></p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-7089" src="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_233195435.jpeg?resize=1170%2C781&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1170" height="781" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_233195435.jpeg?w=7360&amp;ssl=1 7360w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_233195435.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_233195435.jpeg?resize=768%2C513&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_233195435.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_233195435.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_233195435.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1170px) 100vw, 1170px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>In an attempt to do as much as possible with the 24 hours given, most moms sacrifice sleep and end up sleep-deprived.</p>
<p>While it may seem like the only way to get everything done, exhaustion only slows you down, making you less productive while you are awake.</p>
<p>Getting quality shut-eye is crucial to maintaining your physical and mental health. 7-9 hours of sleep is non-negotiable if you want to be able to have the clarity and energy needed to tackle your mile-long list of supermom tasks.</p>
<p>Even more than slowing down to get in bed, sometimes the ability to actually fall asleep is the biggest challenge busy moms face.</p>
<p>It is common to replay all the events of your stress-filled day or go over your endless mom to-do-list in your head.</p>
<p>Here are a few tips to help you get that critical shut-eye!</p>
<ul>
<li>Go back to self-care tip #1 and UNPLUG at least one-hour before bedtime.</li>
<li>Do 5-10 minutes of stretching or yoga.</li>
<li>Take a warm bath just before laying down.</li>
<li>Eat a <a href="https://sculptnation.com/products/protein" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">protein</a>-rich meal that isn’t too heavy.</li>
<li>Write in your journal, specifically a gratitude journal.</li>
<li>Try to be in bed around the same time every night.</li>
<li>Try some breathing techniques.</li>
<li>Use a weighted blanket.</li>
<li>Use Essential Oils &amp; Aromatherapy Machines</li>
<li>Incorporate natural <a href="https://sculptnation.com/products/burn-pm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">sleep-enhancing supplements</a></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>3: Perform A Health Check</strong></p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-7090" src="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_309968852.jpeg?resize=1170%2C780&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1170" height="780" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_309968852.jpeg?w=5472&amp;ssl=1 5472w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_309968852.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_309968852.jpeg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_309968852.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_309968852.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_309968852.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1170px) 100vw, 1170px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>You wouldn&#8217;t let your kids skip their yearly dental cleaning or wellness check, and you are probably constantly on to your significant other to see their primary care provider for an annual check-up. But are you too busy worrying about everyone else&#8217;s preventative health .. that you are forgetting about your own?</p>
<p>Take some time to look at your calendar and see when you can schedule YOUR regular doctor appointments for things like yearly blood work, exams, scans, cleanings, etc.</p>
<p>You should always try to be ahead of any potential health issues. Getting sick could leave you down and out for days or weeks … <em><strong>and we all know moms don’t get sick days!</strong></em></p>
<p>Book those yearly check-ups, then head to your kitchen and take inventory of <em><strong>other ways you could improve your overall health through supplementation and diet.</strong></em></p>
<p>Stock your pantry and fridge with healthy choices that are easy to grab and go. We always keep a container of <a href="https://sculptnation.com/products/protein" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sculpt Nation Protein</a> on hand for shakes, smoothies, and even simple things like <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/pumpkin-spice-protein/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">protein pancakes</a>. This will ensure you are less tempted to reach for your kid’s snacks when you are too busy to cook.</p>
<p>Two of our favorite supplements that assist in optimizing overall health are <a href="https://sculptnation.com/products/greens" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GREENS</a> and <a href="https://sculptnation.com/products/turmeric" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TURMERIC</a>.</p>
<p>It is hard to get in the nutrients your body needs through diet alone. Adding quality <a href="https://sculptnation.com/products/greens" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GREENS</a> helps close that gap.</p>
<p><a href="https://sculptnation.com/products/greens" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sculpt Nation GREENS</a> is a delicious superfood that is packed with herbs, botanicals, antioxidants, and agents that support a healthy inflammatory response. Just one dose gives you an added boost of powerful superfoods.</p>
<p>In addition to assisting in revitalizing your mental and physical energy, our <a href="https://sculptnation.com/products/greens" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GREENS</a> help prime and support your body and brain to be able to better burn fat, build muscle, and increase performance.</p>
<p>Another supplement you may want to consider to stay healthy is <a href="https://sculptnation.com/products/turmeric" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TURMERIC</a>.</p>
<p>This super-nutrient has been used for centuries to optimize health. But in recent years, studies have found that turmeric goes beyond helping with things like temporary pain related to exercise or supporting a healthy inflammatory response. They discovered it can potentially assist in fighting fatigue, burning body fat, enhancing mental clarity, and help ease gastrointestinal issues such as occasional bloating.</p>
<p>Sculpt Nation&#8217;s <a href="https://sculptnation.com/products/turmeric" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TURMERIC</a> not only provides you with the exact dose you need to see and feel benefits, our proprietary blend includes other key nutrients required for this powerful herb to be absorbed.</p>

<p><strong>5: Do Nothing (Zero. Zilch. Nada.)</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-7121" src="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_307475146-1.jpeg?resize=1170%2C780&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1170" height="780" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_307475146-1.jpeg?w=5760&amp;ssl=1 5760w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_307475146-1.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_307475146-1.jpeg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_307475146-1.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_307475146-1.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_307475146-1.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1170px) 100vw, 1170px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Go to your room, sit outside, or even get in your car! Go anywhere you can find some peace and quiet and don’t do ANYTHING … other than closing your eyes and listening to your heart.</p>
<p>This is different from meditating, where you attempt to clear your mind of ANY thoughts.</p>
<p>With this type of mental mindfulness, you are simply slowing down long enough to listen to the desires hidden deep within you.</p>
<p>The purpose of this self-care exercise is not to leave you sad or anxious. The goal is to reconnect with yourself so that you can be more aware of any area of your life that may be lacking.</p>
<p>This is a great way to explore yourself to determine any areas of your life that are fulfilling and possibly lacking.</p>
<p>Think about things you love, ways you have been ignoring your needs and desires, and what you want out of your life … aside from being a good mom.</p>
<p>“Mom life” can get so busy that it’s common to forget who you are and what makes you happy.<br />
Take a moment to self-reflect!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>TAKE SOME TIME TO SELF CARE</strong><br />
<strong>AND</strong><br />
<strong>DO NOT FEEL GUILTY ABOUT IT!</strong></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-7093" src="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_332558922.jpeg?resize=1170%2C641&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1170" height="641" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_332558922.jpeg?w=5760&amp;ssl=1 5760w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_332558922.jpeg?resize=300%2C164&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_332558922.jpeg?resize=768%2C421&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_332558922.jpeg?resize=1024%2C561&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_332558922.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_332558922.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1170px) 100vw, 1170px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>Far too often, moms are flooded with feelings of guilt when they actually do take time to break-free from mom life and take care of themselves.</p>
<p>Whether you decide to wake up 10 minutes early to sit and enjoy your cup of coffee alone before your crazy day begins, or take two hours to train and go to the spa, <em><strong>never feel guilty about time spent ON YOU!</strong></em></p>
<p>Self-care is an essential part of motherhood! The more time you can set aside to take care of your own needs, the happier you will be. Which will only bring more happiness, energy, and love to those around you!</p>

<p>Regardless of race, gender, age, or demographic .. there is a worldwide health issue that none of us are resistant to.</p>

<p>There will be seasons of life that present more tension than others and we all wake up on the wrong side of the bed from time to time.</p>
<p>One or two days of mounting pressure here and there shouldn’t compromise your health, but stressing out more days than not… <em><strong>can take a serious toll on your mind, body, and spirit.</strong></em></p>
<p>The most recent data gathered by <a href="http://www.gostress.com/stress-facts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Global Organization for Stress</a> found that “75% of adults in the United States reported experiencing moderate to high levels of stress in the past month, and nearly half reported that their stress has increased in the past year.”</p>
<p>Stress is, no doubt, a pervasive problem. Still, yet, we tend to brush off the dangers it can cause and continue to live overwhelmed.</p>
<p><em><strong>April is STRESS AWARENESS MONTH</strong></em>&#8230;. an annual time when healthcare professionals and mental health experts from all over the country come together to increase public awareness about the harmful effects stress can have and the ways to combat it.</p>
<p>We’re sure you don’t need a month on your already jam-packed calendars to tell you that we are a stressed-out nation. But it’s great to have a reminder to step back and look at why you may be on edge and examine ways to properly manage (and limit) stressful moments.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>We can’t totally avoid stressors&#8230; </strong></em><br />
<em><strong>but we can take charge of how we deal with them.</strong></em></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-7019" src="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_209509033.jpg?resize=1024%2C602&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="602" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_209509033.jpg?resize=1024%2C602&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_209509033.jpg?resize=300%2C176&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_209509033.jpg?resize=768%2C452&amp;ssl=1 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>In this article, we are going to go over …</p>
<ul>
<li>The definition of “chronic” stress.</li>
<li>Ways chronic stress can negatively impact your health and waistline.</li>
<li>How to recognize the effects of chronic stress.</li>
<li>Ways to manage stress before (and when) it consumes you.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>WHAT IS “CHRONIC” STRESS</strong><br />
Not all stress is bad. If you know how to properly manage stressful situations, a little bit of adrenaline can give you a boost that helps you perform better.</p>
<p>Stress is a natural reaction. When our body senses danger, it is flooded with an increase in several hormones. Your “fight or flight” response kicks in. This isn’t negative as long as you don’t STAY in this zone.</p>
<p>Short term stress (also known as acute stress) typically comes and goes so quickly that it doesn’t result in any long-term adverse effects.</p>
<p>Chronic stress is different. This type of stress is ongoing.<em><strong> It is a constant rush of stress hormones that can be debilitating to your mental and physical health.</strong></em></p>
<p>Chronic stress doesn’t have to come as a result of a major traumatic event. In fact, it’s everyday routine pressures that leave most people, “chronically stressed.”</p>
<p>When your “fight or flight” mode stays “on” for an extended time (or kicks in too often) … that is when you are in a danger zone.</p>
<p>Being in constant “panic mode” presents an opportunity for every system in your body to be affected … either directly or indirectly.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-6995 size-full" src="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_229647193.jpeg?resize=1170%2C658&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1170" height="658" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_229647193.jpeg?w=3840&amp;ssl=1 3840w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_229647193.jpeg?resize=300%2C169&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_229647193.jpeg?resize=768%2C432&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_229647193.jpeg?resize=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_229647193.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_229647193.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1170px) 100vw, 1170px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><strong>HOW CHRONIC STRESS AFFECTS THE BODY</strong><br />
The longer your body is &#8220;stressed,&#8221; the more significant the impact it will have on your mind and body.</p>
<p>Everyone deals with pressure differently. This varies from person to person based on if the stress is “situational” or “routine” .. and of course your personality type.</p>
<p>Our bodies can handle a little bit of stress. But, we are not designed to manage chronic stress without consequence.</p>
<p>Some ways chronic stress can impact your health include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Weight Gain</li>
<li>Mental Health Problems</li>
<li>GI Issues</li>
<li>Low Libido (and other sexual dysfunctions)</li>
<li>Skin and Hair Problems</li>
<li>Developing bad habits (using alcohol, tobacco, drugs, etc.) as a way to cope.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>HOW TO RECOGNIZE THE EFFECTS OF CHRONIC STRESS</strong><br />
Because we are presented with stressful situations every day, it can sometimes be challenging to determine if you are just a little uptight and in a lousy mood, or if your stress has gotten out of control.</p>
<p>The sooner you realize your stress has moved into a “chronic” state .. the better chance you have to avoid the health hazards it can create.</p>
<p>Because people handle stress differently, everyone&#8217;s symptoms may be different.</p>
<p>Here are a few signs that your stress levels have potentially gone from manageable to chronic:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Extreme fatigue</strong></li>
<li><strong>Inability to concentrate</strong></li>
<li><strong>Racing thoughts</strong></li>
<li><strong>Constant worry</strong></li>
<li><strong>Low motivation</strong></li>
<li><strong>Irritability</strong></li>
<li><strong>A drastic shift in mood (always sad or angry)</strong></li>
<li><strong>Digestive issues</strong></li>
<li><strong>Headaches</strong></li>
<li><strong>Tense muscles</strong></li>
<li><strong>Chest tightness/pain</strong></li>
<li><strong>Blurred vision</strong></li>
<li><strong>Problems falling and staying asleep</strong></li>
<li><strong>Changes in sex drive</strong></li>
<li><strong>A weakened immune system</strong></li>
<li><strong>Unexplained weight gain (or loss)</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>WAYS TO MANAGE STRESS</strong><br />
It may seem like you&#8217;re doomed to live a life full of mounting pressure .. especially if your stressors are something you can’t prevent or control.</p>
<p>Remember, just because you can’t avoid stress, does not mean you can’t be better equipped to deal with it. <em><strong>You have more control than you realize!</strong></em></p>
<p>Of course, stress management is not one-size-fits-all. It may take some experimenting to figure out what calms you the most.</p>

<p><strong>1. Recognize, Admit, Accept &amp; Take Ownership</strong><br />
Stop saying, <em>“I’m fine”</em> and admit that you could probably chill out a little.</p>
<p>If you don’t acknowledge you are overwhelmed, you can’t take appropriate action steps to get things under control.</p>
<p>Every time you notice any of the “stress symptoms” mentioned above, admit you are stressed and take note of what is causing you to become frazzled.</p>
<p>Some stressors are easy to identify (job loss, moving, a break-up, chronic illness, etc.)<br />
In these situations, the best thing you can do is accept that it is happening and focus on the things you can control, such as the way you choose to react.</p>
<p>Other causes of stress are more difficult to pinpoint.<br />
It is easy to look past the actions, thoughts, and feelings that are keeping you uptight. Be honest with yourself, and consider that the real cause of your stress could originate from your own bad attitude, unhealthy habits, or excuses.</p>
<p>Once you have a list of your stress triggers and ways that you are contributing… start looking at ways you can eliminate.</p>
<p>If it’s not impossible to rid yourself of the source, you have to learn to manage the stress it causes.</p>
<p><strong>The next 7 steps will help with that.</strong></p>

<p><strong>2. Get regular exercise</strong><br />
There is a reason that many people call workouts .. therapy. Exercise can provide a healthy distraction and research proves that those who workout regularly are much less anxious than those who do not.</p>
<p>Being active reduces stress hormones and releases the brains “feel good” chemicals &#8230; called endorphins. This rush can elevate your mood and decrease tension.</p>
<p>You can up the “happy” by taking some of your workouts outdoors! Natural sunlight can boost mood and help regulate your circadian rhythm to promote a good night’s rest.</p>
<p>Sleep is even more important when you are stressed out, because tension can cause your cortisol (stress hormone) to skyrocket!</p>
<p>One of the best ways to combat that and keep your cortisol in a healthy range&#8230; is with quality sleep!</p>

<p><strong>3. Meditation</strong><br />
Practicing meditation does wonders for not only relaxing your mind… but shifting your focus from negative to positive.</p>
<p>Making time for your spiritual health can allow you to see things from a new, and much calmer perspective (more on perspective in tip #8 below.)</p>
<p>Find a quiet place and spend at least 10 minutes in the present moment. Allow any anxious or negative thoughts to come in, and then use your personal practice of meditation to release them.</p>
<p><em><strong>Words are powerful</strong></em>. Set positivity into motion by speaking positive hope-filled words instead of fear-filled words. Say it, believe for it!</p>
<p><img class="wp-image-7001 size-full" src="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_330846998.jpeg?resize=1170%2C780&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1170" height="780" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_330846998.jpeg?w=5760&amp;ssl=1 5760w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_330846998.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_330846998.jpeg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_330846998.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_330846998.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_330846998.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1170px) 100vw, 1170px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><strong>4. Try Journaling</strong><br />
The simple act of writing things down and “getting them off your chest” has been proven to significantly reduce stress.</p>
<p>Writing down the way you feel helps clear your mind, organize your thoughts, and gives meaning to the things weighing you down.</p>
<p>There is no right or wrong way to journal. Start writing all of your thoughts and emotions, but don’t only use your journal as a way to vent.</p>
<p><em><strong>Keeping a journal is most beneficial if you also make time to focus on the positive.</strong></em></p>
<p>Write down things you are grateful for, and at least one positive that is happening, or could happen, as a result of your stressors.</p>
<p>Include ways you can improve your reactions, outcomes you would like to see, and lessons you would like to learn from your hardships.</p>
<p>It is just as important to be positive in your writing as it is to release the negative.</p>
<p>If you find it difficult to concentrate while journaling, check out <a href="https://sculptnation.com/neuroctane" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this article</a> for some helpful tips to enhance mental clarity. Our brain is continually going, going, going. Like any other muscle, it needs to be fueled to function at top capacity.</p>

<p><strong>5. Breathing Techniques</strong><br />
One of the most powerful tools for returning to a calm state of mind after a moment of stress is incorporating breathing exercises.</p>
<p>These techniques work by activating a part of the nervous system that controls your relaxation response.</p>
<p>There are many apps and methods out there.</p>
<p>Here are two of our favorites.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/lung-health-and-disease/learning-diaphragmatic-breathing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Belly Breathing:</strong></a><br />
Start by sitting or lying down. Take a deep breath through your nose until your chest is full and your belly expands.. then slowly exhale. You should begin to feel relaxing effects after just a few breaths.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=8&amp;v=gz4G31LGyog&amp;feature=emb_logo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The 4-7-8 Method:</a></strong><br />
While sitting or lying in a comfortable position, empty all of the air out of your lungs.<br />
Breathe in through your nose for 4 seconds, hold the breath for 7 seconds, and then exhale forcefully through your mouth for 8 seconds. Repeat the cycle up to 4 times.</p>
<p>Both of these methods can regulate your heart rate, lower your stress hormones (cortisol), and almost instantly reverse the stress response.</p>
<p><img class="size-large wp-image-7022" src="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_94995620.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_94995620.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_94995620.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_94995620.jpeg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_94995620.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_94995620.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><strong>6. Set Limits</strong><br />
One major cause of stress is being pulled in a million different directions.</p>
<p>Stress levels are almost always parallel to the number of items on your to-do list. However, it’s not so much the ITEMS on your agenda that causes stress, as much as it is your attachment to them or fears that they won’t have a particular outcome, or get checked off.</p>
<p>Ask yourself how important the outcome is, then determine what’s necessary and what’s not. Learn to SAY NO to the things that are not essential, or can be passed on to someone else.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><em><strong>Much of your stress is connected to the things that are left UNdone.</strong></em><br />
<em><strong>Instead of a TO DO list … maybe you should have an &#8230; I am NOT GONNA DO IT list!</strong></em></p>
<p>There are other boundaries (that do not involve your calendar) that you can set that will lower stress levels.</p>
<ul>
<li>Remove yourself from stressful situations that don’t directly involve you.</li>
<li>Limit negative screen time (the news, etc.)</li>
<li>Avoid being around negative or easily agitated people.</li>
</ul>
<p><img class="wp-image-7006 size-full" src="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_334496676.jpeg?resize=1170%2C774&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1170" height="774" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_334496676.jpeg?w=6090&amp;ssl=1 6090w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_334496676.jpeg?resize=300%2C199&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_334496676.jpeg?resize=768%2C508&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_334496676.jpeg?resize=1024%2C678&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_334496676.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_334496676.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1170px) 100vw, 1170px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><strong>7. Resist Isolation</strong><br />
Loneliness can make it difficult to deal with stress. The “empty” feelings that come about when we isolate ourselves can also make any stress you are under .. even worse.</p>
<p>It is important to connect with people that make you feel calm, happy, and can offer a listening ear.</p>
<p>Researchers found that social interactions release a natural stress reliever called oxytocin. This is a hormone (also known as the cuddle or love hormone) that is released when people bond socially. It counteracts the “fight-or-flight response we told you about at the beginning of this article.</p>
<p>We would normally tell you to limit your screen time and make IN PERSON connections, but in times of social distancing, this may not be possible.</p>
<p>For now, take advantage of technology and have regular phone and video chat dates.</p>
<p>Use social media as well, but be cautious of what accounts you follow. Delete or mute pages that make you feel any sort of pressure and follow accounts that promote positivity.</p>

<p><strong>8. Shift Your Perspective</strong><br />
<em>“People are disturbed not by a thing, but by their perception of a thing.” — Epictetus.</em></p>
<p>What a great quote and principal to apply to our lives.</p>
<p>Our thoughts are not usually fact. We allow our minds to go to places it should never be.<br />
When overwhelmed&#8230; it’s easy to become negative and cynical. Shifting your perspective and being positive can be one of your greatest weapons.</p>
<p>One study at the University of Michigan tested this philosophy with combat soldiers and found that those that were less negative in their thinking and more hopeful functioned better during difficult times.</p>
<p>When faced with something that makes you feel uptight .. ask yourself …</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Is it really worth the panic?</em></li>
<li><em>How important will this be in a week, a month, a year?</em></li>
<li><em>How will stressing out change the situation?</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Now, take those questions a step further and ask yourself how your reaction can make the situation proactive/positive!</p>
<ul>
<li><em>What can I learn from the situation?</em></li>
<li><em>What is the potential silver lining?</em></li>
<li><em>Is there something within the stressor that I can also be grateful for?</em></li>
</ul>
<p><em><strong>Stress can be debilitating if you allow it.</strong></em> Changing the way you look at the situations you face can be the difference in your blood boiling&#8230; or you coming out of the storm a stronger and better person.</p>

<p>Are You Ready? It’s Black Friday and it’s about to get crazy.</p>
<p>It’s the biggest shopping day of the year and you need to be prepared. From finding the perfect deals, planning your timing, waiting in long lines and lasting the full day&#8230;every part of the process needs to be tactically planned.</p>
<p>This “holiday” draws hordes of people out for a full day of shopping. If you’re a Black Friday shopper, try these tips to help you have a healthy shopping experience.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Prepare Your Body!</strong></h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Eat a Healthy Breakfast. </strong>This will help you stay energized throughout the day and keep you from binging on easily accessible fast food. <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/skinny-protein-pumpkin-muffins-recipe-for-thanksgiving/">If you need a quick and healthy breakfast recipe check out this low carb protein pumpkin recipe.</a> It doubles as a quick but filling breakfast and you can take some with you to snack on throughout the day.</li>
<li><strong>Wear Comfortable Clothing.<br />
</strong>You&#8217;ll be battling crowds and possibly stampedes of other shoppers fighting to get their sale items so comfortable and appropriate clothing is a must. Wear closed-toed comfortable shoes since you will be doing a lot of walking and to avoid your toes getting stepped on in the crowded stores.If you&#8217;re carrying a purse consider using a cross-body bag instead, you will avoid pickpocketers and be able to hang onto your personal belongings better.</li>
<li><strong>Get The Energy Boost You&#8217;ll Need.</strong><br />
On Black Friday you might feel exhausted. Thanksgiving can be tiring and chances are you were up early to start shopping. One dose of <a href="https://sculptnation.com/product/burn-fat-burner/"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Sculpt Nations BURN</strong></span></a> will give your body the boost it needs to help you burn off those extra Thanksgiving dinner calories and give you sustainable energy throughout the day.<strong><a href="https://sculptnation.com/product/burn-fat-burner/"> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Snag yourself a bottle for a whopping 50%</span> off</a> when you use coupon code: GAINS50 at checkout</strong> <em>(no fighting the crowds here)</p>
<p></em></li>

</strong>Drink plenty of water while shopping. It&#8217;s easy to get caught up in the Black Friday madness and dehydrate yourself by forgetting to drink water. Make sure you are giving yourself the proper fuel to run your body and keep hydrated.</li>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sometimes, you need a bit more workout motivation to reach the body you&#8217;ve always wanted.</p>
<p>There are some days you can&#8217;t even bring yourself to look at your <span class="scayt-misspell-word" data-scayt-word="crosstraining" data-wsc-lang="en_US">cross-training</span><span> </span>shoes and gym clothes when the alarm goes off. You just want to hit &#8220;snooze&#8221; and sleep all day.</p>
<p>Workout motivation is different for each individual, so it&#8217;s important to find what gives you the extra push to follow through on your goals. Take a look at these 12 tips to keep yourself motivated to keep up your exercise routine and achieve your fitness goals.</p>
<p>Some of them are science-based, while others are common sense. You can try them out and stick with the ones that work best for you.</p>
<h2>12 Workout Motivation Tips To Get That Goal Body</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span style="color: #000080;">1. Get Dressed for a Successful Workout</span></h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-2393 size-full" src="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/man-tying-jogging-shoes-running-outdoors-Workout-Motivation-ss.jpg?resize=625%2C410&#038;ssl=1" alt="Get Dressed for a Successful Workout | The 12 Top Workout Motivation Tips To Get You To The Gym | exercise" width="625" height="410" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/man-tying-jogging-shoes-running-outdoors-Workout-Motivation-ss.jpg?w=625&amp;ssl=1 625w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/man-tying-jogging-shoes-running-outdoors-Workout-Motivation-ss.jpg?resize=300%2C197&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>Even if you don&#8217;t want to work out, get dressed like you are going to the gym or are about to go on a run anyway. Putting on your training shoes and athletic clothing sends a message that it&#8217;s time to work out.</p>
<p>The message isn&#8217;t subtle. By the time you&#8217;re finished and ready to leave the house, you can overcome the motivation barrier.</p>
<p>This tip fits in the &#8220;fake it &#8217;til you make it&#8221; category.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #000080;">2. Get an Early Start</span></h3>
<p>You might have heard that people who work out first thing in the morning achieve more of their exercise goals. Science has shown that some people are morning people, and that others simply aren&#8217;t. However, whether you&#8217;re a morning person or not doesn&#8217;t really matter in this case. People naturally lose motivation over the course of the day.</p>
<p>According to sports psychologist Christopher Friesen, people who put off working out until a later time in the day run the risk of running out of intrinsic motivation, therefore leaving you with either a worse workout or no workout at all.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #000080;">3. Use S.M.A.R.T. Goals For Your Workouts</span></h3>
<p>Do you have ultra-basic goals for your workouts like <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/weight-loss-workout-plan-best/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&#8220;losing weight&#8221;</a> or &#8220;getting fit?&#8221; This type of goal isn&#8217;t bad to have in mind, but it doesn&#8217;t quite fit the S.M.A.R.T. framework that will help you get to these big, overall targets.</p>
<p>S.M.A.R.T. goals are Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Realistic, and fit into a specific Time-frame. Short-term goals fitting the S.M.A.R.T. model could be going down one belt notch in three weeks, or reducing your resting heart rate by five beats a minute within four weeks.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #000080;">4. Change Up Your Workouts</span></h3>
<p>Doing the same workout routine every day is one of the most common <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/top-5-workout-mistakes-youre-making-how-to-avoid-them/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">exercise errors</a>. Not only does the same daily workout get boring, it also leads to rapid plateauing and frustration.</p>
<p>Use a cross-training approach and don&#8217;t stick only to the gym. Get outside a day or two a week for a run, swim, or cycling session. Vary workouts while at the gym.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #000080;">5. Build a Real Reward Into Your Workout</span></h3>
<p>Choose something that you enjoy, and incorporate it into the time you spend working out.</p>
<p>If you listen to music or other audio while exercising, pick a new streaming music channel you want to check out, and only listen to it while you&#8217;re working out.</p>
<p>If you listen to podcasts or audiobooks, use the same methods. This way, you&#8217;ll tie your interests with exercising and increase your motivation.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #000080;">6. Get Your Money&#8217;s Worth</span></h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-2395 size-full" src="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/fit-man-working-out-weights-room-Workout-Motivation-ss.jpg?resize=625%2C418&#038;ssl=1" alt="Get Your Money's Worth | The 12 Top Workout Motivation Tips To Get You To The Gym | fitness goals" width="625" height="418" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/fit-man-working-out-weights-room-Workout-Motivation-ss.jpg?w=625&amp;ssl=1 625w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/fit-man-working-out-weights-room-Workout-Motivation-ss.jpg?resize=300%2C201&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>Some people are money motivated. If you&#8217;ve signed up for a great gym with a hefty price tag, tell yourself that every time you go, you&#8217;re reducing the per-visit cost and getting your money&#8217;s worth.</p>
<p>The same is true of investing in a personal trainer. Not only will the trainer help your motivation, you will also want to get your money&#8217;s worth from the training sessions.</p>
<p>You can also pay yourself a dollar or two every time you work out. Put the money in a jar and spend it on something great after a month or two.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #000080;">7. Know Your Motivational Personality Type</span></h3>
<p>A lot of motivational tips for fitness are geared toward &#8220;positive thinking&#8221; personalities. Inspirational images and ideas of &#8220;being the fittest&#8221; or &#8220;being the best you can be&#8221; work for a lot of people.</p>
<p>What if you&#8217;re not that type of person?</p>
<p>If you tend to see the downside of things, you can turn this to your advantage. Fitness experts advise people who have &#8220;glass half-empty&#8221; personalities to remind themselves of all the bad things that could happen if they don&#8217;t work out.</p>
<p>Maybe you don&#8217;t want your arms to flap around like your third-grade teacher, or maybe you want to avoid a huge belly. Choose the motivation style that works for your personality &#8212; don&#8217;t force a positive attitude if that simply isn&#8217;t who you are.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #000080;">8. Take a Break When You Need It</span></h3>
<p>If you&#8217;re losing motivation to work out, your body could be sending a subconscious message. Fitness experts say that a motivation dip can signal overtraining issues.</p>
<p>Solve the problem by taking a break from your workout routine. Keep moving, but try a slower pace and alternate activities.</p>
<p>Give yourself permission to exercise differently for a specific period, and once the break is over, return to your exercise program.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #000080;">9. Try Caffeine Before a Workout</span></h3>
<p>The International Journal of Sports Nutrition and Exercise Metabolism conducted a study of athletes and caffeine use. The athletes who consumed caffeine in some form before a workout burned about 15% more calories for three hours after they worked out.</p>
<p>Caffeine doesn&#8217;t have to be coffee. You can get sufficient caffeine from matcha, which is powdered green tea.</p>
<p>You could try a matcha green tea latte made with almond milk. Matcha has more nutrition than other types of tea and also has antioxidants.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #000080;">10. Stick With Positive People and Build a Tribe</span></h3>
<p>Isolation causes a lot of problems, and one of them is providing you with a lower motivation to achieve fitness goals. People are social, and spending time with positive people at the gym can help you stick with your program even if you&#8217;re feeling rough, tired, and unmotivated.</p>
<p>Sometimes, a workout buddy is all that is needed. Becoming part of a larger fitness &#8220;tribe&#8221; can help every member achieve their fitness and health goals.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #000080;">11. Sign a Fitness Contract</span></h3>
<p>Write down your fitness goals and program and turn it into a contract. Jeremy Goldhaber-Fiebert, Stanford professor of medicine, says that approaching fitness goals by signing a contract can be effective.</p>
<p>He recommends making a contract to do a specific amount of exercise every week for a specific number of weeks. If you fail, you have to pay a friend or family member money.</p>
<p>If you don&#8217;t pay, you&#8217;ll be embarrassed because your friends and family will know you didn&#8217;t live up to the contract.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #000080;">12. Create a &#8220;Habit Loop&#8221; With Tangible Rewards</span></h3>
<p>Extrinsic or external short-term rewards help reinforce intrinsic or internal habits and attitudes. Exercise scientists say that we can form a &#8220;habit loop&#8221; by tying a positive short-term reward to exercise routines.</p>
<p>Every time you work out, you can give yourself a small but real reward. After a few repetitions, the cycle of doing the workout and subsequently getting the reward will establish a regular &#8220;habit loop.&#8221;</p>
<p>Some post-workout rewards include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Watching an episode of a favorite show</li>
<li>Having a glass of wine</li>
<li>Going to a movie</li>
<li>Going on a date with your partner</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>If your current routine makes it hard for you to find any workout motivation, you may want to change your regiment. You may want to try this quick and easy fat shredding routine you can do at home for those days when you drag your feet to go to the gym:</strong><br />

<p>Whichever of these tips you choose, keep in mind your individual personality and fitness goals. There is no &#8220;one size fits all&#8221; approach to being motivated for a <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/motivation-monday-circuit-workout/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">regular schedule</a> of <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/best-weight-loss-exercises/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">physical activity</a>. Whether you are money-motivated or respond more to positive or negative motivational triggers, give yourself time and try different approaches. You will find the right combination of intrinsic and extrinsic techniques to achieve your fitness goals.</p>
