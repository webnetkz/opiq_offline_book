								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the least likely times, amidst the COVID-19 quarantine, Shady found a lifeline she didn’t even realize she needed. Our V Shred community helped her go from over 250 pounds and unable to play with her kids to an energetic 40-year old that is now on a mission to inspire others. We hope Shady’s V Shred transformation gives you some motivation today!</p>

<h2>Looking For Something More &#8211; Getting Started with V Shred</h2>
<p>Shady is a single mom of two young children that hustles hard, working two jobs to provide for her family.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s hard to believe that this now bubbly and confident 40-year old was almost 70 pounds heavier and battling depression.</p>
<p>At the beginning of 2020, Shady was 252 pounds and in denial.</p>
<blockquote><p>“I felt healthy, but then things started going downhill. My joints were sore, I was having a hard time walking. I couldn&#8217;t go bike riding with the kids. I became lazy and depressed.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Those feelings easily became amplified when COVID-19 hit. After all, she lost her side job in retail, her housecleaning business suffered, and she found herself isolated at home alone with her 2 kids.</p>
<p>But instead of spiraling downward, Shady decided to use her free time to self-reflect. She admitted she had let herself go and took the first step in regaining her health.</p>
<blockquote><p>“I started slowly by walking outside. That gave me the jumpstart. I started to feel better, but I was looking for something more hardcore.”</p></blockquote>
<p>It just so happens that a V Shred ad popped up on Shady’s Facebook page.</p>
<p>She began scrolling and reading transformation stories of women just like her. She instantly knew the V Shred community was exactly the push she needed. She was ready for her own V Shred transformation!</p>
<blockquote><p>“Before I even started day one, I was on the community page, reading these women’s posts of inspiration, and love, and encouragement. It was average women that showed before and afters. Just reading how supportive everybody was, that was a huge part of it for me.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Without hesitation, she downloaded the V Shred app and purchased the <a href="https://vshred.com/sp/fat-loss-extreme-f/sku_CKcwR4TEg54IeG?utm_source=blog-shady&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=female-motivation-testimonial&amp;utm_content=FLE-zee.j&amp;utm_term=5">Fat Loss Extreme program</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>“It kicked my butt! I even felt better after just one day.”</p></blockquote>
<h2>Community Helped Shady&#8217;s V Shred Transformation Mean Something More</h2>
<p>Working out wasn’t unfamiliar territory for Shady. At one time, she was a fitness instructor! It was the dieting part that was foreign. But thanks to the free information in the V Shred app and pointers from thousands of new friends, Shady taught herself how to track macros and eat clean.</p>
<blockquote><p>“I didn’t realize that diet was 80% of it. All the information that you get with the app, it&#8217;s just so helpful and really insightful. It&#8217;s easy to follow and such a good program.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Before long, Shady was no longer reading other women&#8217;s success stories. She had the confidence to post her own inspiring before and after pictures.</p>
<blockquote><p>“It is absolute sister love, it truly is. It&#8217;s like you have connections with these people from all over the world. It&#8217;s incredible.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Shady’s new love for health and fitness also led her to set an example for her two young kids.</p>
<blockquote><p>“My son was only eating Kraft dinners, hot dogs, and garbage food. I was like, you know what guys, you&#8217;re 9 and 10, I want you guys to be healthy for life and not do it as late as I did. We literally went through the entire house and donated everything that we could that was not nutritional.”</p></blockquote>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-7650" src="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/shady-healthy-lifestyle-family.png?resize=1024%2C390&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="390" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/shady-healthy-lifestyle-family.png?resize=1024%2C390&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/shady-healthy-lifestyle-family.png?resize=300%2C114&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/shady-healthy-lifestyle-family.png?resize=768%2C292&amp;ssl=1 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Every day wasn’t easy. There were moments when Shady wanted to quit.</p>
<blockquote><p>“You have those days you just want to stay into the covers and close the blinds and shut everyone out. But then the kids would come into my room and say, mom, let&#8217;s go for a walk!”</p></blockquote>
<p>In just over 3 months, with no gym, only her V Shred app and online community, Shady lost almost 70 pounds! Her physical V Shred transformation even gave her the confidence to join a burlesque dance group and wear a sexy new dress to celebrate turning 40 years young!</p>
<blockquote><p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-7649 size-large" style="margin-top: 0.857143rem; margin-bottom: 0.857143rem; color: #444444; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal;" title="shady V Shred Transformation before and after" src="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/shady-before-after-transformation-blog.jpg?resize=1024%2C1024&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="1024" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/shady-before-after-transformation-blog.jpg?resize=1024%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/shady-before-after-transformation-blog.jpg?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 150w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/shady-before-after-transformation-blog.jpg?resize=300%2C300&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/shady-before-after-transformation-blog.jpg?resize=768%2C768&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/shady-before-after-transformation-blog.jpg?resize=60%2C60&amp;ssl=1 60w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/shady-before-after-transformation-blog.jpg?w=1080&amp;ssl=1 1080w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" />“You look happier, you start smiling more, you’re carrying yourself better. I would post pictures on Facebook, and people would ask, what are you doing? Of course, I told them about the <a href="https://vshred.com/sp/fat-loss-extreme-f/sku_CKcwR4TEg54IeG?utm_source=blog-shady&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=female-motivation-testimonial&amp;utm_content=FLE-zee.j&amp;utm_term=5">V Shred program</a>. ”</p></blockquote>
<h2>Setting Her Sights Forward With Everyone She Loves</h2>
<p>Shady now weighs a more healthy 185 pounds and is setting her focus on building lean muscle by incorporating Sculpt Nation supplements and starting the V Shred <a href="https://vshred.com/sp/toned-in-90-days/v1/?utm_source=blog-shady&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=female-motivation-testimonial&amp;utm_content=FLE-zee.j&amp;utm_term=5">Toned In 90 Days</a> and <a href="https://vshred.com/sp/the-booty-builder/v1/?utm_source=blog-shady&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=female-motivation-testimonial&amp;utm_content=FLE-zee.j&amp;utm_term=5">BootyBuilder</a> programs.</p>
<p>Shady is excited to see just how far new love for fitness can take her, but more than a better body, she just wants her journey to continue to inspire and motivate others to start or continue their own V Shred transformation.</p>
<blockquote><p>“The fact that I&#8217;ve inspired people and it&#8217;s really crazy. It gives me goosebumps. My friends are just like, what are you doing? I want to feel the way you feel. I want to continue to give that to people and inspire people and make them feel good. That&#8217;s all I want.”</p></blockquote>

<p>When exercise becomes a convenient habit, transformations become possible. In August 2019, Deborah, 40, of Inez, TX came back to work after a week off due to nerve damage in her back. The other waitresses in the restaurant where she worked had started a small weight loss challenge. The winner amongst them would get the prize pool from each person’s $5 buy in plus a gift card for matching that total. It wasn’t much, but Deborah figured what the heck…and now her V Shred transformation is inspiring others!</p>
<p><em>“I put money in and signed up, but I was convinced I wouldn’t lose weight so I just kept doing what I normally did.”</em> she explained.</p>
<p>After a couple weeks, as some of the other waitresses started to lose a few initial pounds Deborah saw a photo of herself and did not like what was looking back at her.</p>
<p><em>“Man was it an eye opener.”</em></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-7636" src="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Deb-before-blog.png?resize=1024%2C1024&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="1024" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Deb-before-blog.png?resize=1024%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Deb-before-blog.png?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 150w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Deb-before-blog.png?resize=300%2C300&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Deb-before-blog.png?resize=768%2C768&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Deb-before-blog.png?resize=60%2C60&amp;ssl=1 60w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Deb-before-blog.png?w=1080&amp;ssl=1 1080w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>The very next day she signed up for a gym membership with a friend. As they both consistently went to the gym after dropping the kids off at school at eating healthier, she started to notice results.</p>
<p><em>“Within a month I lost 9 pounds! With the busy schedules of kids and work I didn’t want to be stressed about work outs and food.”</em></p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Finding Fat Loss Extreme for Women &#8211; Starting A V Shred Transformation</h2>
<p>It was a good start, but as a busy working mother of 3, Deborah knew she needed something more straightforward and structured.</p>
<p><em>“I needed someone to tell me what workouts to do on what days, how many reps, when to rest, and FOR SURE what to eat. Counting macros was not in the cards for me and didn’t have to be. With V Shred its all done for me and works. I love all of it!!”</em> she described, looking back on her V Shred transformation.</p>
<p>Deborah first got started with the <a href="https://vshred.com/sp/fat-loss-extreme-f/sku_CKcwR4TEg54IeG?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=socialmedia&amp;utm_campaign=female-motivation-testimonial&amp;utm_content=Product-Author&amp;utm_term=5">Fat Loss Extreme for Her</a> program. Once she completed the initial 90 days she switched to the <a href="https://vshred.com/sp/ripped-in-90-days/sku_AR6nTj3PTK3uu9?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=socialmedia&amp;utm_campaign=female-motivation-testimonial&amp;utm_content=Product-Author&amp;utm_term=5">Ripped In 90 Days</a> program, and now does a regular combination of the two.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-7629" src="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/before-after-f-sc-225.jpg?resize=1024%2C1024&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="1024" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/before-after-f-sc-225.jpg?resize=1024%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/before-after-f-sc-225.jpg?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 150w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/before-after-f-sc-225.jpg?resize=300%2C300&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/before-after-f-sc-225.jpg?resize=768%2C768&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/before-after-f-sc-225.jpg?resize=60%2C60&amp;ssl=1 60w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/before-after-f-sc-225.jpg?w=1080&amp;ssl=1 1080w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><em>“I was never involved in working out or eating healthy ever.”</em> Deborah explained. <em>“After starting V Shred my body was constantly changing for the better and I now see muscles I didn’t know I had! I keep going then pushing harder.”</em></p>
<p>Throughout 2020 Deborah was able to continue her exercises at the gym, despite COVID closures in other parts of Texas. Her success inspired her to close in a patio at home, and like many, create her own home gym.</p>
<p><em>“It has everything I need except a stair stepper and a couple of leg machines.”</em></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-7630" src="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/ezgif-2-f58715b67360.gif?resize=1080%2C410&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1080" height="410" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><em>“With the home gym and all of V Shred’s programs, I have plenty to do. I also purchased <a href="https://vshred.com/sp/move?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=socialmedia&amp;utm_campaign=female-motivation-testimonial&amp;utm_content=Product-Author&amp;utm_term=5">V Shred&#8217;s MOVE Program</a> during quarantine! As far as nutrition, I kept making my meal plans [with my V Shred Trainer] and sticking with the diet. We have a garden to grow our own vegetables, have 10 chickens for fresh eggs, and a pond stocked with catfish and perch which are just now getting big enough to eat.”</em></p>
<p>Once her weight loss results were noticeable from diet and exercise alone Deborah started implementing SculptNation supplements to gain that extra edge on her already active day to day life.</p>
<p><em>“When Sculpt Nation has their <a href="https://sculptnation.com/products/fat-loss-stack?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=socialmedia&amp;utm_campaign=female-motivation-testimonial&amp;utm_content=Product-Author&amp;utm_term=5">40% off sales</a> I stock up 3-6 months in advance… My closet is kind of like a supplement store.”</em> Deborah mused.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">A True V Shred Transformation &#8211; From Tired &amp; Injured to Proud &amp; Self-Sufficient</h2>
<p>From the support Deborah received from family and friends, she also had a bit of a wakeup call. Well past the initial challenge with coworkers, others were noticing her body composition change, her improved attitude, and her enthusiasm for helping others. As people started asking her questions, she knew helping others transform into happy and proud versions of themselves (like she had) was something she wanted to do.</p>
<p><em>“My mom saw my weight loss and started training with me. She got down 30 pounds in 3 months! My 4 year old wants to eat what I eat so he can have muscles. My 13 year old loves going to the gym with me. My husband constantly tells me how proud of me he is. They’ve all supported me 100%!”</em></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-7633" src="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Deb-progress2.png?resize=1024%2C1024&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="1024" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Deb-progress2.png?resize=1024%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Deb-progress2.png?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 150w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Deb-progress2.png?resize=300%2C300&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Deb-progress2.png?resize=768%2C768&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Deb-progress2.png?resize=60%2C60&amp;ssl=1 60w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>Now Deborah is returning the favor!</p>
<p><em>“Now that I have been on this journey I know that I absolutely want to help people to hit their personal goals and feel happy and proud of themselves inside and out.”</em></p>
<p>Deborah has enrolled in the ACE personal training certification program. At age 40 with new goals and dreams she’s working to become certified as a trainer, nutritionist, and youth fitness coach to help kids get on the right track early, as she now has been able to help her family do.</p>
<p>This fall Deborah competed in an online competition to be featured on <a href="https://mshealthandfitness.com/2020/deborah-mcdaniel?utm_source=vshred-blog&amp;utm_medium=socialmedia&amp;utm_campaign=female-motivation-testimonial&amp;utm_content=Product-Author&amp;utm_term=5">Ms Health And Fitness</a> and finished in the top 10!</p>
<h2>Giving Back Fitness Motivation</h2>
<p>When Deborah was asked about how community plays a part in a fitness journey and her personal V Shred transformation she mentioned her success was all about the support she received. Motivating loved ones, professional guidance, and a community of like minded individuals help make personal transformations possible.</p>
<p><em>“My experience with Vshred has been life changing. When it comes to my fitness journey I am proud that I stuck to it even when I didn’t want to. The Vshred for women Facebook page is amazing, all the support and transformation are awesome!”</em></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-7568" src="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/43707f0c562bc5957a2488cd1a9fd5322a9e2de0.jpg?resize=1024%2C768&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="768" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/43707f0c562bc5957a2488cd1a9fd5322a9e2de0.jpg?resize=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/43707f0c562bc5957a2488cd1a9fd5322a9e2de0.jpg?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/43707f0c562bc5957a2488cd1a9fd5322a9e2de0.jpg?resize=768%2C576&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/43707f0c562bc5957a2488cd1a9fd5322a9e2de0.jpg?w=1440&amp;ssl=1 1440w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><em>“I never even thought of going to the gym and eating healthy, but now want to help others do it. If V Shred wouldn’t have been such an amazing program I probably would have stopped a long time ago!”</em></p>
<p>The V Shred Team is so proud of Deborah’s journey and cannot wait to see her help others build active and healthy lifestyles. Her’s is a unique, and lifelong journey. Shred on!</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Most successful weight-loss transformation stories start with an “aha” moment. That sudden shift in mindset that pushes someone to stop coming up with every reason why they can’t do something and instead take the first step towards making a lasting change.</p>
<p>Dylan’s personal story of tragedy, and weight loss then muscle-gain triumph with V Shred will inspire you.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-7526 size-full" src="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/117163427_4254430027932957_2001345014807689283_n.jpg?resize=960%2C960&#038;ssl=1" alt="Dylan's V Shred weight-loss transformation before, during, after photo" width="960" height="960" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/117163427_4254430027932957_2001345014807689283_n.jpg?w=960&amp;ssl=1 960w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/117163427_4254430027932957_2001345014807689283_n.jpg?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 150w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/117163427_4254430027932957_2001345014807689283_n.jpg?resize=300%2C300&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/117163427_4254430027932957_2001345014807689283_n.jpg?resize=768%2C768&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/117163427_4254430027932957_2001345014807689283_n.jpg?resize=60%2C60&amp;ssl=1 60w" sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>For 28-year-old Dylan, his “aha” moment was a combination of his own life set-backs that resulted in weight gain and depression. When those were coupled with the sudden loss of his brother and surviving a natural disaster (on the same day) he knew it was time for a change.</p>
<p>Dylan grew up a football star. Everything was going as planned through high school until he lost a university scholarship and his dreams were crushed. <em>“I went to work, came home, and sat in front of the TV. That was pretty much it.”</em> for years after, explains Dylan.</p>
<p>At an unhealthy 355 pounds, the mental and physical misery Dylan felt every day still wasn’t enough to push him to do something about it. The depression told him he was too far gone. <em>“I didn’t go out because I hated the way I looked. I wouldn’t take my shirt off, even for my girlfriend. It was hard because I used to be this person that was athletic and outgoing. I knew I let myself go, but I thought at that point, there was no fixing it.”</em></p>
<p>The year 2017 was a dark period and the lowest point of Dylan’s life. He saw he was headed in the same direction as someone else he loved. “<em>My brother had depression and substance abuse issues. He was even bigger than I was, and his depression was brought on by his weight. He wasn&#8217;t happy with himself.”</em></p>
<h2>A Day That Changed Everything</h2>
<p>On September 10, 2017 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Irma">Hurricane Irma</a> hit Dylan’s home state of Florida. On the very same day his brother committed suicide. <em>“I swore at that moment, I wasn&#8217;t going to turn into that.”</em></p>
<p>It was the perfect storm to create a lightning bolt moment (his aha.) Dylan knew he had to make a change. His life depended on it.</p>
<p>Scared, and even a little intimidated, Dylan decided to take the first step of his weight-loss transformation. “I&#8217;d seen V Shred almost every single day for two weeks, and I finally clicked the ad, and it was the best thing I ever did.”</p>
<h2>Starting A Weight-Loss Transformation With V Shred</h2>
<p>The former football star knew <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/strength-training/">how to lift weights</a> with a coach screaming down his neck, but had no clue how to workout by himself. Being in the gym, alone, without a coach or teammates was entirely different. As he started to learn more about nutrition in those early days Dylan also realized he didn’t have the slightest clue about cardio or nutrition.</p>
<p>Thankfully, he didn’t have to learn everything alone. The <a href="https://vshred.com/programs/fat-loss-extreme?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=male-motivation-testimonial&amp;utm_content=FLE-male-zee.j&amp;utm_term=5">V Shred Fat Loss Extreme</a> plan laid everything out for him. He simply had to put in the work. <em>“I had an extreme goal. I wanted to lose a hundred pounds within a year. I blew that out the water. I got on pace to where I already knew I was going to hit my goal, and I just kept going.”</em></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-7596 size-full" src="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/24AC0918-158B-4FCE-9E61-6D7A1EE801B0_1_201_a.jpeg?resize=750%2C870&#038;ssl=1" alt="Dylan's V Shred Fat Loss Extreme weight-loss transformation After photo" width="750" height="870" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/24AC0918-158B-4FCE-9E61-6D7A1EE801B0_1_201_a.jpeg?w=750&amp;ssl=1 750w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/24AC0918-158B-4FCE-9E61-6D7A1EE801B0_1_201_a.jpeg?resize=259%2C300&amp;ssl=1 259w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>Dylan also found a lot of help from the V Shred community online, which gave him support and new ideas for exercises and <a href="https://vshred.com/sp/recipe-guide/v1?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=socialmedia&amp;utm_campaign=male-motivation-testimonial&amp;utm_content=FLE-male-zee.j&amp;utm_term=5">recipes</a>. <em>“The V Shred Group “is like Google! It’s constantly refreshing itself for me. Everybody’s in the same mindset that I&#8217;m in, searching without me even having to search.”</em></p>
<p>In his first year with V Shred, Dylan dropped 135 pounds. But his transformation didn’t stop there. He got all the way down to 180 pounds!</p>
<p>After a grand total of 155 pounds lost, Dylan decided to end his weight loss journey, but not in the way you may think.</p>
<h2>Changing His Goals &amp; Changing His Mindset</h2>
<p>Dylan decided to do something that may have been even harder than the initial weight loss.</p>
<p>He started <a href="https://vshred.com/programs/clean-bulk-program?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=socialmedia&amp;utm_campaign=male-motivation-testimonial&amp;utm_content=FLE-male-zee.j&amp;utm_term=5">V Shred&#8217;s Clean Bulk Program</a> to build the muscle needed to reshape his new skinnier body. <em>“I developed body dysmorphia. I became afraid of eating too much. So going from losing all that weight to knowing I have to eat in a surplus and gain weight was a struggle for me.”</em></p>
<p>Dylan quickly learned that his V Shred coaches knew what they were doing. They had a weight-loss transformation plan that would allow him to build muscle without gaining a ton of excess fat.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-7597 size-full" src="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/0AF6A317-A447-4CC1-AEDB-18CA271B8EF2_1_201_a.jpeg?resize=750%2C744&#038;ssl=1" alt="Dylan's V Shred Clean Bulk weight-loss transformation and muscle gain After photo" width="750" height="744" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/0AF6A317-A447-4CC1-AEDB-18CA271B8EF2_1_201_a.jpeg?w=750&amp;ssl=1 750w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/0AF6A317-A447-4CC1-AEDB-18CA271B8EF2_1_201_a.jpeg?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 150w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/0AF6A317-A447-4CC1-AEDB-18CA271B8EF2_1_201_a.jpeg?resize=300%2C298&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/0AF6A317-A447-4CC1-AEDB-18CA271B8EF2_1_201_a.jpeg?resize=60%2C60&amp;ssl=1 60w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>After a 3 year journey with V Shred, Dylan sits at 210 pounds of lean muscle.</p>
<p>But the external transformation is only half of his life-changing results. Dylan is a new man both inside and out. He has developed confidence and a fresh zest for the life he shares with his fiancé and two kids.</p>
<p>Dylan’s weight-loss transformation, however, hasn’t come without setbacks. COVID limitations made it hard to hit heavy weights, and over Labor Day weekend, he had an accident that dislodged two ribs!</p>
<p>Instead of getting down about not being able to lift heavy enough to continue his bulk, he shifted his mindset. Dylan decided that he would attempt his very first “cut” using <a href="https://vshred.com/sp/ripped-in-90-days/sku_AR6nTj3PTK3uu9?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=male-motivation-testimonial&amp;utm_content=FLE-male-zee.j&amp;utm_term=5">V Shred Ripped In 90 Days</a>. We can’t wait to see his next set of transformation pictures!!</p>
<p>Dylan&#8217;s advice to anyone scared of or too hesitant to purchase a plan is this …</p>
<p><em>“Everyone asks me “the secret”. You have the basic responses; diet is key and hit the gym hard. But those are common knowledge. <strong>There is one thing that is going to get you the results you want &#8211; eliminate the excuses!</strong> The “I’m tired., I’ll go harder tomorrow” or “I can’t find the time” won’t work, and will only hold you back. V Shred is a building block (and an amazing one at that). With all the information, the support, and this group, you 100% can achieve your goal. Get grinding guys, and keep reaching your goals and making new ones!”</em></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You may believe winter weight gain happens because of the holidays. Those extra home cooked meals and holiday parties are certainly a factor. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But </span><b><i>there is a DAILY issue you need to be prepared to fight </i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">if you want to avoid packing on winter pounds.</span></p>
<p><b>WHY YOU REALLY PACK ON POUNDS AFTER LABOR DAY</b></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the spring and summer months, you are given what we call a</span><b> fitness freebie. </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You get a </span><b><i>seasonal motivation boost</i></b> <span style="font-weight: 400;">that doesn’t happen when temperatures start to drop, and you begin to pull out the chunky sweaters and comfy leggings. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not only is the sun shining (which makes you happier because of Vitamin D), you are wearing LESS clothing in the summer months. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I don’t know about you, but knowing I’m going to be exposing more skin makes walking in the gym a little easier. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Covering up in layers, no doubt leads to the temptation to slack on body goals! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Knowing your arms, legs, and abs will be less exposed can easily be an excuse to slack. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, being layered up often means you don’t SEE the extra pounds, so they are easier to ignore.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But there is more to it than being bundled up….</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-7477" src="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_236518834.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_236518834.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_236518834.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_236518834.jpeg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_236518834.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_236518834.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span>The #1 reason you slack on health and fitness goals in colder months ISN’T EVEN YOUR FAULT!!</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, you have a part to play in all of this, but</span><b><i> there is actually a scientific reason why you have less desire to train and eat healthy when the sunshine of summer fades.</i></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We will explain why a little further down. But ya know what really stinks? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The scientific reason why we all experience these motivation slumps in the winter only adds to an even bigger issue with motivation.</span></p>

<p>Spring, Summer, Fall, or Winter &#8211; you can NEVER rely on it!</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, what can you do when lack of sunshine and warm temps leave you even more tempted to hit snooze and reach for comfort foods? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You certainly don’t throw your hands up in the air and wait until January to make a resolution to crash diet to get your body ready for spring. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Believe it or not, RIGHT NOW is actually the IDEAL time to get started! </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you </span><b><i>START NOW, </i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">you will develop discipline and a routine heading into the holidays. This will put you in a great place mentally and physically to relax and “indulge” a little more at all those holiday gatherings! </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><b><i>Look at it this way ..<br />
</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Would you rather head into the holiday season already making progress toward your goals and be in a great spot <em>(where it would be okay even if you did gain an extra pound or two?)</em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Or would you rather put it off and only add more fat on top of what you want to lose?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The answer is clear— the solution to getting the motivation needed to make it happen, not so much.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But don’t worry! We’ve got ya covered</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (no pun intended)</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with a few easy motivation hacks!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><b>7 TIPS TO STAY MOTIVATED AS SEASONS CHANGE</b></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><b><br />
</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the number one questions we always get is … “<em>I am just not motivated. How can I motivate myself to train and eat better?”</em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As we mentioned earlier, it doesn&#8217;t matter what season it is, </span><b><i>you can’t always rely on motivation. </i></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you have it, great! You should certainly take advantage of it! But you have to know that it is totally normal to not have much of it. Even professional athletes lack motivation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You have to develop other daily habits that create discipline if you want to succeed long term!</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are a few of our pro tips that we use with our clients, specifically when temperatures drop, and motivation seems to be at its lowest! </span></p>
<p><b>TIP #1: Switch To An At Home Training Program</b></p>
<p><img class="size-large wp-image-7448" src="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_185038762.jpeg?resize=1024%2C647&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="647" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_185038762.jpeg?resize=1024%2C647&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_185038762.jpeg?resize=300%2C189&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_185038762.jpeg?resize=768%2C485&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_185038762.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_185038762.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you know that getting out of bed and stepping into the winter elements is going to be an excuse trigger, make a plan to train at home during cooler months! Some of the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">most effective and challenging workouts </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">only require your body weight and </span><b><i>maybe</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a set of dumbbells or some resistance bands.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A good fat-blasting, muscle-building sweat session can 100% be achieved from the comfort of your home!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adjustable dumbbells, ankle weights, resistance bands, a jump rope, etc., are all things that are inexpensive and can easily be stored in a closet or under your bed and pulled out anytime you don’t feel like leaving the house.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But if you have </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">the right training program</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><b><i>you don’t need any of that. </i></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our favorite </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">at-home bodyweight-only program</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is called</span><b> MOVE. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was designed to help you achieve your fitness goals without a single piece of equipment, and each workout is under 20 minutes! </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the bottom of this article, we will tell you about a big end of summer sale happening so that you can stock up on our </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">favorite </span><a href="https://sculptnation.com/products/pre-workout" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><b>PRE WORKOUT</b></a><strong> for 40% off when you use code: LABORDAY40 at checkout! </strong></p>
<p><b>TIP #2: Make Your Workouts Seasonal</b></p>
<p><img class="size-large wp-image-7452" src="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_65703942.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_65703942.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_65703942.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_65703942.jpeg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_65703942.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_65703942.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Embrace the change of seasons and take advantage of activities that you can only do in fall or winter! </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Go on a fall hike and view all the gorgeous foliage.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Try rock climbing.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Walk around a corn maze or pumpkin patch with your family. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you live in a snowy climate, go skiing, sledding, build snowmen with your kids, etc.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Go ice skating.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lace-up your sneakers, go for a walk or run at night, and admire all the Christmas lights and decorations.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are some things you can only do and see during specific times of the year. So instead of missing sunshine and water sports, focus on all the positive things that only come about with cooler temps!</span></p>
<p><b>TIP #3: Try Something Totally New</b></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-7454" src="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_361152601.jpeg?resize=1024%2C514&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="514" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_361152601.jpeg?resize=1024%2C514&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_361152601.jpeg?resize=300%2C151&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_361152601.jpeg?resize=768%2C386&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_361152601.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_361152601.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sometimes a change of routine is all you need to boost motivation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you have been doing all your gym lifts alone, recruit a gym buddy! Try switching up your cardio by skipping your solo runs and joining a group fitness class instead. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another option is to </span><b><i>allow yourself to slow down!</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> If you have been crushing it all spring and summer with intense training and hardcore workouts, </span><b><i>it may actually be time to take it down a notch. </i></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Going full force 365 can cause your stress hormone cortisol to increase. This can lead to a host of drawbacks, including weight gain, muscle loss, poor moods, fatigue, and occasional issues sleeping! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We aren’t saying you should become lazy! But if you have been crushing it 24/7 all spring and summer, your body (and mind) may need to slow down.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Use the next few months to embrace a slower routine. </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Commit to daily yoga.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Focus on becoming more flexible.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Switch to low or moderate-intensity cardio, instead of HIIT.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Try out some bodyweight workouts instead of heavy lifting.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Giving your body a couple of months to recover might even make you more responsive when you decide to kick things up again come spring/summer!</span></p>
<p><b>TIP #4: Stay Accountable</b></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-7457" src="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_266584820.jpeg?resize=1024%2C768&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="768" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_266584820.jpeg?resize=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_266584820.jpeg?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_266584820.jpeg?resize=768%2C576&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_266584820.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_266584820.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><b><br />
</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">The best way to stick to a plan is to have someone that you report back to. This could be a friend, family member, a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">social media community</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, or even a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">coach. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Including someone else, or even just telling someone else about your health and fitness goals and asking them to check in with you to make sure you are sticking to the plan, is a great way to keep the promises you make to yourself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you prefer to fly solo, it helps to create visuals. Make a vision board, create a daily checklist you can mark off after each workout, or keep an accomplishment journal.</span></p>
<p><b>TIP #5: Set A Spring Goal</b></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">March may seem like a long time away, but it will be back before you know it, and 6 months is a long time to make significant changes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Setting a goal is a great way to encourage yourself to push past discomforts and temptation, but there is a science to goal setting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The key to creating goals that stick .. </span><b><i>be REALISTIC and SPECIFIC!</i></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s start with </span><b><i>reality. </i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">You should always focus on one goal at a time and make sure you are being honest with yourself if that goal is really attainable.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you know that your schedule will never allow you to work out 6 days a week, why would you choose a program that requires you to do that?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you know it’s not healthy to attempt to lose 10 pounds a week, why would you aim that high?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you love carbs, why would you go on a KETO diet? </span></p>
<p><b><i>Doing these things will essentially set yourself up for failure.</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Set attainable goals that fit YOUR lifestyle. You can always bump things up if your schedule allows, or you notice you aren’t pushing yourself hard enough. Just keep in mind that being realistic isn’t the same as not believing in yourself or making excuses. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moving on to being </span><b><i>specific.</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The more specific you are about your goals, the more likely you will be to reach them. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It may seem like it’s good enough to say things like .. I want to look good, lose weight, or get ripped! </span><b><i>But you have to dig deeper than that!! </i></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wanting to “lose weight,” for example, is an excellent place to start. But ask yourself what that means to you?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you expand on that and say &#8212; “I want to lose 10 pounds of fat. I will do this by not eating any sweets and doing the V Shred </span><a href="https://vshred.com/sp/move/soc-all/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><b>MOVE </b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">program for 30 consecutive days. I am doing this because I want to have better self-esteem and a head start on bikini season.” &#8212; that makes your goal more specific.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The more specific (and attainable) your goals are, the more likely you will be to not give up!</span></p>
<p><b>TIP #6: Reward Yourself</b></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-7459" src="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/vin_sant_32048508_366936073798151_433609263865135104_n.jpg?resize=882%2C1024&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="882" height="1024" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/vin_sant_32048508_366936073798151_433609263865135104_n.jpg?resize=882%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 882w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/vin_sant_32048508_366936073798151_433609263865135104_n.jpg?resize=258%2C300&amp;ssl=1 258w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/vin_sant_32048508_366936073798151_433609263865135104_n.jpg?resize=768%2C892&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/vin_sant_32048508_366936073798151_433609263865135104_n.jpg?w=1080&amp;ssl=1 1080w" sizes="(max-width: 882px) 100vw, 882px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you have checked a “mini goal” off your list, treat yourself. Knowing that you have a reward coming to celebrate your efforts will make you want to achieve it even more. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It may be tempting to make your reward one of your favorite “forbidden foods” but we never suggest that you reward yourself this way.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You aren’t a dog. You should never reward “good behavior” with food. Having this mentality can create a really unhealthy relationship with food.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You need to eat healthy MOST of the time, control your portions, and see food as fuel. But if you are craving something that isn’t quite as healthy as your grilled chicken and rice, never feel like you need to lose 20 pounds to “deserve” a bite of cake, or nice dinner out with your family. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instead of rewarding yourself with food, buy yourself something you have been wanting. Maybe some new workout clothes, a massage, or an extra $20 bucks in your vacation fund! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you think you need some nutrition guidance or want to learn more about creating a healthy relationship with food, take our <a href="https://vshred.com/sp/survey/survey-aka1/">free body type quiz</a> and we&#8217;ll tell you exactly what type of diet will deliver results for your goals and specific body type. </span></p>
<p><b>TIP #7: Make Mental Health Top Priority</b></p>
<p><img class="size-large wp-image-7460" src="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_255894146.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_255894146.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_255894146.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_255894146.jpeg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_255894146.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_255894146.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Earlier, we mentioned that cold weather motivation dips may not be your fault.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’m sure you have heard of winter blues. Well, it’s a real thing. Less natural light can cause dips in serotonin, the neurotransmitter that regulates mood.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The dark and dreary days of winter can also cause your body to produce more of the sleep hormone melatonin. This shift can disrupt your body and impact your sleep patterns and overall mood.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are a few ways that you can focus on improving your mental health.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Invest in a light therapy box that simulates natural daylight.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Make sure you are supplementing with or eating plenty of foods with Vitamin D.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Start journaling. There is a lot of scientific evidence that supports putting your thoughts on paper provides a long list of benefits, including stress management, self-confidence, and goal setting. </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Suppose you still find yourself struggling with negative seasonal motivation shifts. In that case, you may need to experiment with taking</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> naturally sourced herbs</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to help support brain health and a positive mood.</span></p>
<p><b><i>Here are a few with some great scientific backing to help boost mood.</i></b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>EnXtra: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">A natural caffeine-free patent-pending botanical ingredient that has been shown to help increase dopamine levels.**It is also one of the first and only natural caffeine-free patent-pending botanical ingredients shown to boost mental alertness &amp; acuity for hours or ending in a huge caffeine energy crash.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Piper Nigrum Fruit Extract:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> A very specific type of black pepper that has been shown to help increase both serotonin and dopamine.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>L-Theanine:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> A powerful amino acid that is believed to help reduce occasional anxiety brought on by stressful situations.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can find all of these natural herbs (plus 3 more) in a one of a kind supplement called </span><b><a href="https://sculptnation.com/neuroctane/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NEUROCTANE</a>. </b></p>

<p><b><i>BOTTOM LINE IF YOU WANT TO STAY MOTIVATED YEAR ROUND</i></b><b><i><br />
</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you put away the shorts and swimsuits and shift out of bikini season, it’s common for motivation to “fall back” with the clocks. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The seasons have to change (unless you live near the equator) &#8211; so you have to figure out ways to</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">not let your fitness goals go into hibernation mode!</span><b><i> </i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pumpkin spice lattes are only here for a limited time, but getting into shape isn’t seasonal! </span><i>It&#8217;s a year-round commitment!!</i><i> </i></p>

<p>It’s been a crazy few months, hasn’t it? As we return to some sense of normalcy&#8230;<strong> we can’t forget that our medical professionals still walk into hospitals everyday that are anything but normal!</strong></p>
<p>The heroes still on the front lines of this pandemic remain on lockdown … doing what they have done from day one… working around the clock to save lives.</p>
<p><em>“The biggest problem we face is burn out. Working months straight isn’t normal”</em>, says Lauran Donofrio, a nurse from Florida that is volunteering her services at the #1 trauma hospital in NYC.</p>
<p><strong>We wanted to get a REAL glimpse at the struggles our brave doctors and nurses </strong><strong>STILL FACE TODAY &#8211; and how we can do our part to help!!</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/v-shred-relief-fund-for-exhausted-nyc-medical-team"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-7211" src="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/GFM-blog-Donate-button-1-1.png?resize=914%2C194&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="914" height="194" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/GFM-blog-Donate-button-1-1.png?w=914&amp;ssl=1 914w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/GFM-blog-Donate-button-1-1.png?resize=300%2C64&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/GFM-blog-Donate-button-1-1.png?resize=768%2C163&amp;ssl=1 768w" sizes="(max-width: 914px) 100vw, 914px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>Lauran used one of her very short breaks to share the struggles our doctors and nurses still face months into this pandemic and how YOUR encouragement helps them cope! Thousands of doctors and nurses like Lauran continue to work tirelessly, in what is STILL being described as a WAR ZONE … with no days off, no dinners with their family, no time to do anything for themselves.</p>
<p><em>“I facetime my kids every night. They are 3 and 6, and I think they are getting taller since I”ve been here. I miss them so much,</em>” says Lauran.</p>
<p>By choice, Lauran and thousands of other medical professionals, are selflessly putting their own lives on the line to care for others that have been infected with Covid-19. <em>“It’s like the army or war. We have military nurses that say this is as close as you are going to get to war,”</em> explains Donofrio.</p>
<p>I simply can’t fathom what these medical professionals are going through. Not only the physical demands but as you hear in <a href="https://youtu.be/JXkmLKg1C90">Lauran’s interview</a>, the mental turmoil they face.</p>
<p>I mean, can you imagine having to be the person that holds the phone, so that loved ones not allowed in the hospital can facetime to say their final goodbyes to family members?</p>
<p><strong>Lauran says two things keep her going</strong>&#8230;. the support of the other medical professionals and encouragement from the community.</p>

<p><strong>You may not live in New York, where residents gather every day to cheer them on…</strong><strong>but you can still let them know you appreciate their sacrifices!</strong></p>
<p>From afar, the best way you can let these heroes know that their work matters .. that they are making a difference … and encourage them to keep up the good work … is to help make sure their basic needs are met.</p>
<p>By donating to the <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/v-shred-relief-fund-for-exhausted-nyc-medical-team">Go-Fund-Me Fundraiser</a> we set up, you can help these front line heroes get the necessary supplies they need to be protected as they continue to save lives.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/v-shred-relief-fund-for-exhausted-nyc-medical-team"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-7221" src="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Screen-Shot-2020-04-20-at-11.26.35-AM.png?resize=616%2C168&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="616" height="168" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Screen-Shot-2020-04-20-at-11.26.35-AM.png?w=616&amp;ssl=1 616w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Screen-Shot-2020-04-20-at-11.26.35-AM.png?resize=300%2C82&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 616px) 100vw, 616px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>And not only medical supplies .. things you and I take for granted … like a warm meal, clean clothes, and a safe place to sleep.</p>
<p>Our doctors and nurses .. especially those volunteering their time should not have to come out of pocket for what they need to SAVE LIVES!! No donation is too small, every dollar can help&#8230;</p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><em>If they are going to risk their lives for us…</em><em>they deserve the best possible care needed to save them!!</em></p>
<p>These men and women are not replaceable, and unless <em><strong>we step up to help</strong></em> provide them with what they need to do their job safely, <em><strong>we risk losing them.</strong></em></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-7225" src="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Screen-Shot-2020-04-20-at-11.28.22-AM.png?resize=572%2C140&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="572" height="140" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Screen-Shot-2020-04-20-at-11.28.22-AM.png?w=572&amp;ssl=1 572w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Screen-Shot-2020-04-20-at-11.28.22-AM.png?resize=300%2C73&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 572px) 100vw, 572px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>I don’t know about you .. but I want to do my small part to help make sure that never happens!</p>
<p><em><strong>Let’s send the encouragement Lauran says keeps them going!</strong></em> By donating, you are showing these warriors that you recognize that the fight isn’t over. You are letting them know that you see them still working on the front lines in conditions they have likely never seen and appreciate their bravery, selflessness, and compassion.</p>

<p>Motherhood is a mix of many things….<br />
It is a blessing, but it can also be frustrating, hectic, and at times, even monotonous.<br />
It is beautiful knowing that you are helping shape a future generation, but that also brings about a lot of pressure and responsibility.</p>
<p>You are always going mentally and physically, which means just like any other job, burnout is bound to happen<em><strong> if you don’t s-l-o-w down!!</strong></em></p>
<p>If you are a mom reading this… we want you to ask yourself a few important questions.</p>
<ul>
<li>When is the last time I put my needs first?</li>
<li>Do I regularly focus on self-care?</li>
<li>Do I have a good mom/life balance?</li>
</ul>
<p>You likely answered…</p>
<ul>
<li>Rarely/Never</li>
<li>No, not regularly.</li>
<li>What is life .. outside of being a mom?</li>
</ul>
<p>Being a mom has required responsibilities, but you have to stop and think about <em><strong>your own needs</strong></em>. Going non-stop can take a toll on both your mental and physical health.</p>
<p>How can you be SUPERMOM if you aren’t taking time to REST and RECHARGE?</p>
<p><strong>Easier said than done, right?</strong><br />
It SOUNDS great to be able to pour a glass of wine, put on a face mask, jump in a bubble bath, and turn on a meditation app.</p>
<p>In REALITY, you haven’t had time to go to the store to get groceries, your kid’s toys are still in the tub that you haven’t had time to clean, and if you do manage to hop in, forget silence. It won’t be long before there is a little knock at the door, interrupting your zen!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>BUT MOMS… LISTEN UP!</strong></p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-7087" src="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_221068765.jpeg?resize=1170%2C780&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1170" height="780" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_221068765.jpeg?w=6500&amp;ssl=1 6500w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_221068765.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_221068765.jpeg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_221068765.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_221068765.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_221068765.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1170px) 100vw, 1170px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>To be able to take care of everyone else, you have to feel your best both physically and mentally.</p>
<p>Self-care is not selfish .. it’s actually the opposite.<em><strong> A happy and fulfilled mom .. is no doubt a better mom!</strong></em></p>
<p>Use Mother’s Day as a reminder that YOU ARE SPECIAL and deserve just as much TLC as everyone else in your family!</p>
<p>Here are FIVE IDEAS that will help give you the mental and physical energy needed to tackle both the chaos and glory that make up motherhood!!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>5 Ways To Focus On Self-Care This Mother’s Day</strong></p>
<p>Self-Care is a personal process. What helps you unwind may be different than what helps somebody else de-stress. However, these 5 self-care tips are things ALL busy moms should consider.</p>
<p>Remember, self-care isn’t just a day at the spa or date night without the kids.<br />
It is ANY activity you do that will improve your mental, spiritual, and physical health.</p>
<p>In fact, the best types of self-care aren’t about only feeling good in the moment. Just like your health and fitness journey… the ultimate goal of self-care should be its long-term effects!</p>
<p><strong>1: DISCONNECT</strong></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-7088" src="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_338261185.jpeg?resize=1170%2C780&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1170" height="780" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_338261185.jpeg?w=7776&amp;ssl=1 7776w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_338261185.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_338261185.jpeg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_338261185.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_338261185.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_338261185.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1170px) 100vw, 1170px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>Put your computer away, turn off your phone, don’t tune into the news, and click out of Netflix.</p>
<p>Sometimes the most effective thing you can do for yourself has little to do with what TO DO and more to do with what you DO NOT DO!</p>
<p>While it is great to be informed and socially connected .. <em><strong>too much time plugged in can add to your stress, anxiety, and life fears.</strong></em></p>
<p>This is especially true for social media. It is one thing if you <em><strong>only</strong></em> follow accounts that motivate you and feed you with positivity. But many of us “follow” the lives of others and end up comparing, leading to feelings of not being good enough.</p>
<p>Social media can also be a rabbit hole of negativity and biased opinions, leaving you confused, negative, anxious, uptight, and even angry. <em><strong>Put yourself on a social media diet and limit your screen-time and scrolling.</strong></em></p>
<p>The same “digital detox” rules should also apply for TV time. The news (especially these days) can only fuel your fears.<em><strong> If you must watch, tune in only to be informed and immediately power off!</strong></em></p>
<p>If binge-watching Netflix is how you like to unwind, go for it! But the next time you have watched enough episodes for it to ask you &#8211; “are you still watching” &#8211; consider doing something else relaxing that could be more beneficial to your long term mental health.</p>
<p>Take up a new hobby you would enjoy, journal, call a friend, read a book, maybe even try those “stress relieving” adult coloring books!</p>
<p><strong>2: GET REGULAR SLEEP</strong></p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-7089" src="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_233195435.jpeg?resize=1170%2C781&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1170" height="781" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_233195435.jpeg?w=7360&amp;ssl=1 7360w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_233195435.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_233195435.jpeg?resize=768%2C513&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_233195435.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_233195435.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_233195435.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1170px) 100vw, 1170px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>In an attempt to do as much as possible with the 24 hours given, most moms sacrifice sleep and end up sleep-deprived.</p>
<p>While it may seem like the only way to get everything done, exhaustion only slows you down, making you less productive while you are awake.</p>
<p>Getting quality shut-eye is crucial to maintaining your physical and mental health. 7-9 hours of sleep is non-negotiable if you want to be able to have the clarity and energy needed to tackle your mile-long list of supermom tasks.</p>
<p>Even more than slowing down to get in bed, sometimes the ability to actually fall asleep is the biggest challenge busy moms face.</p>
<p>It is common to replay all the events of your stress-filled day or go over your endless mom to-do-list in your head.</p>
<p>Here are a few tips to help you get that critical shut-eye!</p>
<ul>
<li>Go back to self-care tip #1 and UNPLUG at least one-hour before bedtime.</li>
<li>Do 5-10 minutes of stretching or yoga.</li>
<li>Take a warm bath just before laying down.</li>
<li>Eat a <a href="https://sculptnation.com/products/protein" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">protein</a>-rich meal that isn’t too heavy.</li>
<li>Write in your journal, specifically a gratitude journal.</li>
<li>Try to be in bed around the same time every night.</li>
<li>Try some breathing techniques.</li>
<li>Use a weighted blanket.</li>
<li>Use Essential Oils &amp; Aromatherapy Machines</li>
<li>Incorporate natural <a href="https://sculptnation.com/products/burn-pm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">sleep-enhancing supplements</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Our favorite supplement for sleep is a product called <a href="https://sculptnation.com/products/burn-pm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BURN PM</a>.</p>
<p>It contains relaxation agents like L-Tryptophan and Melatonin that will help support falling asleep, enter deep sleep faster, and stay there longer. Perfect for occasional sleeplessness. But we took <a href="https://sculptnation.com/products/burn-pm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">our nighttime sleep aid</a> a step further and added nighttime thermogenics that are designed to help support fat burning while you sleep.</p>
<p>As a special Mother’s Day gift to you .. we are giving all moms an extra 30% off <a href="https://sculptnation.com/products/burn-pm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BURN PM</a> (and any other supplement you choose) when you use code: <a href="https://sculptnation.com/products/burn-pm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>MOMSDAY30</strong></a> at checkout! <a href="https://sculptnation.com/products/burn-pm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Click Here to shop.</a></p>

<p><strong>3: Perform A Health Check</strong></p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-7090" src="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_309968852.jpeg?resize=1170%2C780&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1170" height="780" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_309968852.jpeg?w=5472&amp;ssl=1 5472w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_309968852.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_309968852.jpeg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_309968852.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_309968852.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_309968852.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1170px) 100vw, 1170px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>You wouldn&#8217;t let your kids skip their yearly dental cleaning or wellness check, and you are probably constantly on to your significant other to see their primary care provider for an annual check-up. But are you too busy worrying about everyone else&#8217;s preventative health .. that you are forgetting about your own?</p>
<p>Take some time to look at your calendar and see when you can schedule YOUR regular doctor appointments for things like yearly blood work, exams, scans, cleanings, etc.</p>
<p>You should always try to be ahead of any potential health issues. Getting sick could leave you down and out for days or weeks … <em><strong>and we all know moms don’t get sick days!</strong></em></p>
<p>Book those yearly check-ups, then head to your kitchen and take inventory of <em><strong>other ways you could improve your overall health through supplementation and diet.</strong></em></p>
<p>Stock your pantry and fridge with healthy choices that are easy to grab and go. We always keep a container of <a href="https://sculptnation.com/products/protein" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sculpt Nation Protein</a> on hand for shakes, smoothies, and even simple things like <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/pumpkin-spice-protein/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">protein pancakes</a>. This will ensure you are less tempted to reach for your kid’s snacks when you are too busy to cook.</p>
<p>Two of our favorite supplements that assist in optimizing overall health are <a href="https://sculptnation.com/products/greens" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GREENS</a> and <a href="https://sculptnation.com/products/turmeric" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TURMERIC</a>.</p>
<p>It is hard to get in the nutrients your body needs through diet alone. Adding quality <a href="https://sculptnation.com/products/greens" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GREENS</a> helps close that gap.</p>
<p><a href="https://sculptnation.com/products/greens" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sculpt Nation GREENS</a> is a delicious superfood that is packed with herbs, botanicals, antioxidants, and agents that support a healthy inflammatory response. Just one dose gives you an added boost of powerful superfoods.</p>
<p>In addition to assisting in revitalizing your mental and physical energy, our <a href="https://sculptnation.com/products/greens" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GREENS</a> help prime and support your body and brain to be able to better burn fat, build muscle, and increase performance.</p>
<p>Another supplement you may want to consider to stay healthy is <a href="https://sculptnation.com/products/turmeric" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TURMERIC</a>.</p>
<p>This super-nutrient has been used for centuries to optimize health. But in recent years, studies have found that turmeric goes beyond helping with things like temporary pain related to exercise or supporting a healthy inflammatory response. They discovered it can potentially assist in fighting fatigue, burning body fat, enhancing mental clarity, and help ease gastrointestinal issues such as occasional bloating.</p>
<p>Sculpt Nation&#8217;s <a href="https://sculptnation.com/products/turmeric" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TURMERIC</a> not only provides you with the exact dose you need to see and feel benefits, our proprietary blend includes other key nutrients required for this powerful herb to be absorbed.</p>
<p>That 30% off special Mother’s Day discount can also be used on these products!<br />

<p><strong>4: Exercise</strong></p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-7091" src="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_167087638.jpeg?resize=1170%2C695&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1170" height="695" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_167087638.jpeg?w=5759&amp;ssl=1 5759w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_167087638.jpeg?resize=300%2C178&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_167087638.jpeg?resize=768%2C456&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_167087638.jpeg?resize=1024%2C608&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_167087638.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_167087638.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1170px) 100vw, 1170px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>For some moms, a workout is the perfect escape. For others, working out may seem more like a chore than a treat.</p>
<p>Like it or not, exercise is one of the best (if not THE best) ways you can take care of yourself.</p>
<p>Getting in some sort of daily physical activity can enhance mood, reduce stress, and give you a major self-esteem boost!</p>
<p>The number one reason most moms skip the gym is that they can&#8217;t find the time.</p>
<p><em><strong>If inking in a sweat session seems impossible</strong></em>, you can always try INCLUDING your kids in your workout!</p>
<p>It may not be IDEAL .. or the escape you want .. but at least you will be able to get it done! <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/strong-as-a-mother-mommy-me-workouts-for-every-age/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Check out this article for OVER 30 kid-friendly exercise ideas!</a></p>
<p>So, get out of your comfy mom sweats, throw on some workout clothes, put on your favorite playlist, and get moving!</p>
<p>If you need some ideas that don’t involve your kids, we have thousands of FREE home workouts on our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/vshred" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">YouTube Channel</a>. Many can be done with no equipment and in 20 minutes or less!</p>
<p><strong>5: Do Nothing (Zero. Zilch. Nada.)</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-7121" src="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_307475146-1.jpeg?resize=1170%2C780&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1170" height="780" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_307475146-1.jpeg?w=5760&amp;ssl=1 5760w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_307475146-1.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_307475146-1.jpeg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_307475146-1.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_307475146-1.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_307475146-1.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1170px) 100vw, 1170px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Go to your room, sit outside, or even get in your car! Go anywhere you can find some peace and quiet and don’t do ANYTHING … other than closing your eyes and listening to your heart.</p>
<p>This is different from meditating, where you attempt to clear your mind of ANY thoughts.</p>
<p>With this type of mental mindfulness, you are simply slowing down long enough to listen to the desires hidden deep within you.</p>
<p>The purpose of this self-care exercise is not to leave you sad or anxious. The goal is to reconnect with yourself so that you can be more aware of any area of your life that may be lacking.</p>
<p>This is a great way to explore yourself to determine any areas of your life that are fulfilling and possibly lacking.</p>
<p>Think about things you love, ways you have been ignoring your needs and desires, and what you want out of your life … aside from being a good mom.</p>
<p>“Mom life” can get so busy that it’s common to forget who you are and what makes you happy.<br />
Take a moment to self-reflect!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>TAKE SOME TIME TO SELF CARE</strong><br />
<strong>AND</strong><br />
<strong>DO NOT FEEL GUILTY ABOUT IT!</strong></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-7093" src="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_332558922.jpeg?resize=1170%2C641&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1170" height="641" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_332558922.jpeg?w=5760&amp;ssl=1 5760w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_332558922.jpeg?resize=300%2C164&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_332558922.jpeg?resize=768%2C421&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_332558922.jpeg?resize=1024%2C561&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_332558922.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_332558922.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1170px) 100vw, 1170px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>Far too often, moms are flooded with feelings of guilt when they actually do take time to break-free from mom life and take care of themselves.</p>
<p>Whether you decide to wake up 10 minutes early to sit and enjoy your cup of coffee alone before your crazy day begins, or take two hours to train and go to the spa, <em><strong>never feel guilty about time spent ON YOU!</strong></em></p>
<p>Self-care is an essential part of motherhood! The more time you can set aside to take care of your own needs, the happier you will be. Which will only bring more happiness, energy, and love to those around you!</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We all share something in common.</p>
<p>Regardless of race, gender, age, or demographic .. there is a worldwide health issue that none of us are resistant to.</p>
<p><img class="wp-image-6993 size-full" src="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_323879183.jpeg?resize=1170%2C780&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1170" height="780" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_323879183.jpeg?w=6436&amp;ssl=1 6436w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_323879183.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_323879183.jpeg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_323879183.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_323879183.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_323879183.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1170px) 100vw, 1170px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>There will be seasons of life that present more tension than others and we all wake up on the wrong side of the bed from time to time.</p>
<p>One or two days of mounting pressure here and there shouldn’t compromise your health, but stressing out more days than not… <em><strong>can take a serious toll on your mind, body, and spirit.</strong></em></p>
<p>The most recent data gathered by <a href="http://www.gostress.com/stress-facts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Global Organization for Stress</a> found that “75% of adults in the United States reported experiencing moderate to high levels of stress in the past month, and nearly half reported that their stress has increased in the past year.”</p>
<p>Stress is, no doubt, a pervasive problem. Still, yet, we tend to brush off the dangers it can cause and continue to live overwhelmed.</p>
<p><em><strong>April is STRESS AWARENESS MONTH</strong></em>&#8230;. an annual time when healthcare professionals and mental health experts from all over the country come together to increase public awareness about the harmful effects stress can have and the ways to combat it.</p>
<p>We’re sure you don’t need a month on your already jam-packed calendars to tell you that we are a stressed-out nation. But it’s great to have a reminder to step back and look at why you may be on edge and examine ways to properly manage (and limit) stressful moments.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>We can’t totally avoid stressors&#8230; </strong></em><br />
<em><strong>but we can take charge of how we deal with them.</strong></em></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-7019" src="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_209509033.jpg?resize=1024%2C602&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="602" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_209509033.jpg?resize=1024%2C602&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_209509033.jpg?resize=300%2C176&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_209509033.jpg?resize=768%2C452&amp;ssl=1 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>In this article, we are going to go over …</p>
<ul>
<li>The definition of “chronic” stress.</li>
<li>Ways chronic stress can negatively impact your health and waistline.</li>
<li>How to recognize the effects of chronic stress.</li>
<li>Ways to manage stress before (and when) it consumes you.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>WHAT IS “CHRONIC” STRESS</strong><br />
Not all stress is bad. If you know how to properly manage stressful situations, a little bit of adrenaline can give you a boost that helps you perform better.</p>
<p>Stress is a natural reaction. When our body senses danger, it is flooded with an increase in several hormones. Your “fight or flight” response kicks in. This isn’t negative as long as you don’t STAY in this zone.</p>
<p>Short term stress (also known as acute stress) typically comes and goes so quickly that it doesn’t result in any long-term adverse effects.</p>
<p>Chronic stress is different. This type of stress is ongoing.<em><strong> It is a constant rush of stress hormones that can be debilitating to your mental and physical health.</strong></em></p>
<p>Chronic stress doesn’t have to come as a result of a major traumatic event. In fact, it’s everyday routine pressures that leave most people, “chronically stressed.”</p>
<p>When your “fight or flight” mode stays “on” for an extended time (or kicks in too often) … that is when you are in a danger zone.</p>
<p>Being in constant “panic mode” presents an opportunity for every system in your body to be affected … either directly or indirectly.</p>

<p><strong>HOW CHRONIC STRESS AFFECTS THE BODY</strong><br />
The longer your body is &#8220;stressed,&#8221; the more significant the impact it will have on your mind and body.</p>
<p>Everyone deals with pressure differently. This varies from person to person based on if the stress is “situational” or “routine” .. and of course your personality type.</p>
<p>Our bodies can handle a little bit of stress. But, we are not designed to manage chronic stress without consequence.</p>
<p>Some ways chronic stress can impact your health include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Weight Gain</li>
<li>Mental Health Problems</li>
<li>GI Issues</li>
<li>Low Libido (and other sexual dysfunctions)</li>
<li>Skin and Hair Problems</li>
<li>Developing bad habits (using alcohol, tobacco, drugs, etc.) as a way to cope.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>HOW TO RECOGNIZE THE EFFECTS OF CHRONIC STRESS</strong><br />
Because we are presented with stressful situations every day, it can sometimes be challenging to determine if you are just a little uptight and in a lousy mood, or if your stress has gotten out of control.</p>
<p>The sooner you realize your stress has moved into a “chronic” state .. the better chance you have to avoid the health hazards it can create.</p>
<p>Because people handle stress differently, everyone&#8217;s symptoms may be different.</p>
<p>Here are a few signs that your stress levels have potentially gone from manageable to chronic:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Extreme fatigue</strong></li>
<li><strong>Inability to concentrate</strong></li>
<li><strong>Racing thoughts</strong></li>
<li><strong>Constant worry</strong></li>
<li><strong>Low motivation</strong></li>
<li><strong>Irritability</strong></li>
<li><strong>A drastic shift in mood (always sad or angry)</strong></li>
<li><strong>Digestive issues</strong></li>
<li><strong>Headaches</strong></li>
<li><strong>Tense muscles</strong></li>
<li><strong>Chest tightness/pain</strong></li>
<li><strong>Blurred vision</strong></li>
<li><strong>Problems falling and staying asleep</strong></li>
<li><strong>Changes in sex drive</strong></li>
<li><strong>A weakened immune system</strong></li>
<li><strong>Unexplained weight gain (or loss)</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>WAYS TO MANAGE STRESS</strong><br />
It may seem like you&#8217;re doomed to live a life full of mounting pressure .. especially if your stressors are something you can’t prevent or control.</p>
<p>Remember, just because you can’t avoid stress, does not mean you can’t be better equipped to deal with it. <em><strong>You have more control than you realize!</strong></em></p>
<p>Of course, stress management is not one-size-fits-all. It may take some experimenting to figure out what calms you the most.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>8 Proven Stress Management Techniques</strong></p>
<p><img class="size-large wp-image-7021" src="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_283771005.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_283771005.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_283771005.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_283771005.jpeg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_283771005.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_283771005.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><strong>1. Recognize, Admit, Accept &amp; Take Ownership</strong><br />
Stop saying, <em>“I’m fine”</em> and admit that you could probably chill out a little.</p>
<p>If you don’t acknowledge you are overwhelmed, you can’t take appropriate action steps to get things under control.</p>
<p>Every time you notice any of the “stress symptoms” mentioned above, admit you are stressed and take note of what is causing you to become frazzled.</p>
<p>Some stressors are easy to identify (job loss, moving, a break-up, chronic illness, etc.)<br />
In these situations, the best thing you can do is accept that it is happening and focus on the things you can control, such as the way you choose to react.</p>
<p>Other causes of stress are more difficult to pinpoint.<br />
It is easy to look past the actions, thoughts, and feelings that are keeping you uptight. Be honest with yourself, and consider that the real cause of your stress could originate from your own bad attitude, unhealthy habits, or excuses.</p>
<p>Once you have a list of your stress triggers and ways that you are contributing… start looking at ways you can eliminate.</p>
<p>If it’s not impossible to rid yourself of the source, you have to learn to manage the stress it causes.</p>
<p><strong>The next 7 steps will help with that.</strong></p>

<p><strong>2. Get regular exercise</strong><br />
There is a reason that many people call workouts .. therapy. Exercise can provide a healthy distraction and research proves that those who workout regularly are much less anxious than those who do not.</p>
<p>Being active reduces stress hormones and releases the brains “feel good” chemicals &#8230; called endorphins. This rush can elevate your mood and decrease tension.</p>
<p>You can up the “happy” by taking some of your workouts outdoors! Natural sunlight can boost mood and help regulate your circadian rhythm to promote a good night’s rest.</p>
<p>Sleep is even more important when you are stressed out, because tension can cause your cortisol (stress hormone) to skyrocket!</p>
<p>One of the best ways to combat that and keep your cortisol in a healthy range&#8230; is with quality sleep!</p>

<p><strong>3. Meditation</strong><br />
Practicing meditation does wonders for not only relaxing your mind… but shifting your focus from negative to positive.</p>
<p>Making time for your spiritual health can allow you to see things from a new, and much calmer perspective (more on perspective in tip #8 below.)</p>
<p>Find a quiet place and spend at least 10 minutes in the present moment. Allow any anxious or negative thoughts to come in, and then use your personal practice of meditation to release them.</p>
<p><em><strong>Words are powerful</strong></em>. Set positivity into motion by speaking positive hope-filled words instead of fear-filled words. Say it, believe for it!</p>

<p><strong>4. Try Journaling</strong><br />
The simple act of writing things down and “getting them off your chest” has been proven to significantly reduce stress.</p>
<p>Writing down the way you feel helps clear your mind, organize your thoughts, and gives meaning to the things weighing you down.</p>
<p>There is no right or wrong way to journal. Start writing all of your thoughts and emotions, but don’t only use your journal as a way to vent.</p>
<p><em><strong>Keeping a journal is most beneficial if you also make time to focus on the positive.</strong></em></p>
<p>Write down things you are grateful for, and at least one positive that is happening, or could happen, as a result of your stressors.</p>
<p>Include ways you can improve your reactions, outcomes you would like to see, and lessons you would like to learn from your hardships.</p>
<p>It is just as important to be positive in your writing as it is to release the negative.</p>
<p>If you find it difficult to concentrate while journaling, check out <a href="https://sculptnation.com/neuroctane" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this article</a> for some helpful tips to enhance mental clarity. Our brain is continually going, going, going. Like any other muscle, it needs to be fueled to function at top capacity.</p>

<p><strong>5. Breathing Techniques</strong><br />
One of the most powerful tools for returning to a calm state of mind after a moment of stress is incorporating breathing exercises.</p>
<p>These techniques work by activating a part of the nervous system that controls your relaxation response.</p>
<p>There are many apps and methods out there.</p>
<p>Here are two of our favorites.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/lung-health-and-disease/learning-diaphragmatic-breathing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Belly Breathing:</strong></a><br />
Start by sitting or lying down. Take a deep breath through your nose until your chest is full and your belly expands.. then slowly exhale. You should begin to feel relaxing effects after just a few breaths.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=8&amp;v=gz4G31LGyog&amp;feature=emb_logo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The 4-7-8 Method:</a></strong><br />
While sitting or lying in a comfortable position, empty all of the air out of your lungs.<br />
Breathe in through your nose for 4 seconds, hold the breath for 7 seconds, and then exhale forcefully through your mouth for 8 seconds. Repeat the cycle up to 4 times.</p>
<p>Both of these methods can regulate your heart rate, lower your stress hormones (cortisol), and almost instantly reverse the stress response.</p>
<p><img class="size-large wp-image-7022" src="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_94995620.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_94995620.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_94995620.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_94995620.jpeg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_94995620.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_94995620.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><strong>6. Set Limits</strong><br />
One major cause of stress is being pulled in a million different directions.</p>
<p>Stress levels are almost always parallel to the number of items on your to-do list. However, it’s not so much the ITEMS on your agenda that causes stress, as much as it is your attachment to them or fears that they won’t have a particular outcome, or get checked off.</p>
<p>Ask yourself how important the outcome is, then determine what’s necessary and what’s not. Learn to SAY NO to the things that are not essential, or can be passed on to someone else.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><em><strong>Much of your stress is connected to the things that are left UNdone.</strong></em><br />
<em><strong>Instead of a TO DO list … maybe you should have an &#8230; I am NOT GONNA DO IT list!</strong></em></p>
<p>There are other boundaries (that do not involve your calendar) that you can set that will lower stress levels.</p>
<ul>
<li>Remove yourself from stressful situations that don’t directly involve you.</li>
<li>Limit negative screen time (the news, etc.)</li>
<li>Avoid being around negative or easily agitated people.</li>
</ul>
<p><img class="wp-image-7006 size-full" src="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_334496676.jpeg?resize=1170%2C774&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1170" height="774" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_334496676.jpeg?w=6090&amp;ssl=1 6090w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_334496676.jpeg?resize=300%2C199&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_334496676.jpeg?resize=768%2C508&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_334496676.jpeg?resize=1024%2C678&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_334496676.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_334496676.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1170px) 100vw, 1170px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><strong>7. Resist Isolation</strong><br />
Loneliness can make it difficult to deal with stress. The “empty” feelings that come about when we isolate ourselves can also make any stress you are under .. even worse.</p>
<p>It is important to connect with people that make you feel calm, happy, and can offer a listening ear.</p>
<p>Researchers found that social interactions release a natural stress reliever called oxytocin. This is a hormone (also known as the cuddle or love hormone) that is released when people bond socially. It counteracts the “fight-or-flight response we told you about at the beginning of this article.</p>
<p>We would normally tell you to limit your screen time and make IN PERSON connections, but in times of social distancing, this may not be possible.</p>
<p>For now, take advantage of technology and have regular phone and video chat dates.</p>
<p>Use social media as well, but be cautious of what accounts you follow. Delete or mute pages that make you feel any sort of pressure and follow accounts that promote positivity.</p>

<p><strong>8. Shift Your Perspective</strong><br />
<em>“People are disturbed not by a thing, but by their perception of a thing.” — Epictetus.</em></p>
<p>What a great quote and principal to apply to our lives.</p>
<p>Our thoughts are not usually fact. We allow our minds to go to places it should never be.<br />
When overwhelmed&#8230; it’s easy to become negative and cynical. Shifting your perspective and being positive can be one of your greatest weapons.</p>
<p>One study at the University of Michigan tested this philosophy with combat soldiers and found that those that were less negative in their thinking and more hopeful functioned better during difficult times.</p>
<p>When faced with something that makes you feel uptight .. ask yourself …</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Is it really worth the panic?</em></li>
<li><em>How important will this be in a week, a month, a year?</em></li>
<li><em>How will stressing out change the situation?</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Now, take those questions a step further and ask yourself how your reaction can make the situation proactive/positive!</p>
<ul>
<li><em>What can I learn from the situation?</em></li>
<li><em>What is the potential silver lining?</em></li>
<li><em>Is there something within the stressor that I can also be grateful for?</em></li>
</ul>
<p><em><strong>Stress can be debilitating if you allow it.</strong></em> Changing the way you look at the situations you face can be the difference in your blood boiling&#8230; or you coming out of the storm a stronger and better person.</p>

<p><em><strong>Will You Win Or Lose This Super Bowl Sunday?</strong></em></p>
<p>As the 49ers and Chiefs battle it out on the field, many of you will face your own game day battle&#8230; and we’ve got your defensive strategy!</p>
<p>You made it past the new year’s resolution hump <em>(the point when most people have already failed)</em> and are smashing your goals.</p>
<p><strong>Then… FOUL!!</strong></p>
<p>You are faced with an (unofficial) American holiday that is celebrated with lots of food.</p>
<p>Super Bowl Sunday is the second biggest food consumption day of the year! The only day that scores more calories is Thanksgiving.</p>
<p><strong>Here is what goes down in a matter of only a few hours&#8230;</strong></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-6687 size-large" src="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/AdobeStock_317072671-1.jpeg?resize=1024%2C672&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="672" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/AdobeStock_317072671-1.jpeg?resize=1024%2C672&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/AdobeStock_317072671-1.jpeg?resize=300%2C197&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/AdobeStock_317072671-1.jpeg?resize=768%2C504&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/AdobeStock_317072671-1.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/AdobeStock_317072671-1.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<ul>
<li>1.3 Billion Chicken Wings</li>
<li>2 Million Pizzas</li>
<li>10 Million Pounds of Ribs</li>
<li>88 Million Pounds of Cheese</li>
<li>9200 Tons of Chips</li>
<li>3 Million Pounds of Nuts</li>
<li>325.5 Million Gallons of Beer</li>
</ul>
<p>And that’s just a breakdown of the most popular Super Bowl foods!</p>
<p>So yeah, it’s safe to say that a calorie surplus is in the playbook for many Americans.</p>
<p>While we always preach that <em>“one meal”</em> or even <em>“one day”</em> of eating off your diet plan won’t hurt your overall progress, we’ll let you do the math on how this one day could be an exception.</p>
<p><em><strong>If we know that&#8230;</strong></em></p>
<p>A SURPLUS of 3,500 calories = 1 pound of weight gain.</p>
<p><em><strong>And it is estimated that…</strong></em></p>
<p>The average calories a person will consume on Super Bowl Sunday is 6,000!</p>
<p>It’s easy to see how scrambling back and forth to the buffet table could indeed result in a major poundage penalty, and we want to make sure you are ready to tackle the day!</p>
<p>It may seem like you can’t win unless you sit this one out on the sidelines, but being focused on losing weight does not mean you have to lose out on all the fun, or food!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>FOOLPROOF SUPER BOWL STRATEGY</strong></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-6675 size-large" src="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/superbowl-vince-01.png?resize=1024%2C1024&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="1024" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/superbowl-vince-01.png?resize=1024%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/superbowl-vince-01.png?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 150w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/superbowl-vince-01.png?resize=300%2C300&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/superbowl-vince-01.png?resize=768%2C768&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/superbowl-vince-01.png?resize=60%2C60&amp;ssl=1 60w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/superbowl-vince-01.png?w=1080&amp;ssl=1 1080w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>First… PICK A TEAM</strong><br />
When game day arrives, you should have a plan that starts with deciding which team you are going to be on.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Team <em>“Live-A-Little”</em> VS. Team <em>“Stick-To-The-Plan”</em></strong></p>
<p>We are placing our bets on&#8230;<strong> TEAM LIVE A LITTLE!</strong><br />
That’s because the odds are against you if you tell yourself you aren’t <em>“allowed”</em> to eat something. It is better to go slightly off your plan and practice mindfulness.</p>
<p>Sure, there is the risk that once you get a<em> “taste,”</em> you won’t be able to stop eating, but you have to learn to have willpower at some point. Let’s start mastering that right now!</p>
<p>Your goal is to walk in with a winning attitude.</p>
<p>You can’t let yourself feel ANY guilt about your decision to live a little. Next, you have to trust yourself to be disciplined enough to use mindfulness and moderation to avoid going overboard.</p>
<p><strong>Next… Your Pre-game plan.</strong></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-6719" src="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/superbowl-pregame-blog.png?resize=1024%2C1024&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="1024" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/superbowl-pregame-blog.png?resize=1024%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/superbowl-pregame-blog.png?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 150w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/superbowl-pregame-blog.png?resize=300%2C300&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/superbowl-pregame-blog.png?resize=768%2C768&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/superbowl-pregame-blog.png?resize=60%2C60&amp;ssl=1 60w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/superbowl-pregame-blog.png?w=1080&amp;ssl=1 1080w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><strong>Prepare A Healthy Dish</strong><br />
If you are hosting a party, then you have complete control and can modify almost every snack to be healthy or healthier! If you are attending a party, ask if you can bring something.</p>
<p><strong>Get In Your Workout</strong><br />
Get in your sweat session before the big game. If you tell yourself you’ll do it afterward; you are no doubt setting yourself up to lose!</p>
<p>Add a quick HIIT cardio session on to the end of your lift, like this one, and you will have the perks of that <em>“after-burn effect”</em> that continues well past the final Super Bowl buzzer!</p>
<p><strong>Do Not Calorie Hoard</strong><br />
While it may be tempting to save all your calories or starve yourself in preparation for a food surplus, that is overall a bad idea. Going to the party hungry will NO DOUBT lead to over-eating. At the same time, there is nothing wrong with saving some calories and being mindful in the hours leading up to the big game.</p>
<p>You can do this by having lower carb/fat meals and sticking with mainly lean proteins beforehand. Make sure you have a meal right before the festivities. Fill up a shaker with a <a href="https://sculptnation.com/products/protein">Sculpt Nation Protein</a> smoothie and drink up on your way there!</p>
<p><strong>Get A Good Night Of Sleep</strong><br />
Sleep deprivation not only gets your hormones out of whack, but grogginess also leads to bad decisions, such as overeating! Aim for 7-9 hours of shut-eye the night before the game!</p>
<p>If you need some help falling and staying asleep, you may want to look into a natural remedy, like <a href="https://sculptnation.com/products/burn-pm">Sculpt Nation BURN PM</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Supplement</strong><br />
You can get a head-start before those cravings ever kick in by adding in an appetite suppressant like <a href="https://sculptnation.com/products/burn">Sculpt Nation BURN.</a></p>
<p>You can grab the supplements mentioned above for <strong>30% OFF</strong> now through Superbowl Sunday when you use <strong>code: SUPER30</strong> at checkout! <a href="https://sculptnation.com/products">Click Here to shop.</a></p>

<p><strong>Now It’s Time For KICK-OFF… Implement This 5 Step Defensive Strategy</strong></p>
<p><strong>Survey the spread</strong><br />
Take a look at all your options. Think about what is in each dish, what may be the healthiest option and the most filling. Take a moment to ask yourself what you are really craving. Just because it is on the table doesn’t mean it has to make its way to your plate!</p>
<p><strong>Dive in with mindfulness and moderation</strong><br />
Let’s start with beverages. Drink LOTS of water and unless you can’t fathom game day without a beer or two, pass on empty calories found in alcoholic beverages. If you must have alcohol, opt for a light beer, or liquor paired with calorie-free mixers.</p>
<p>When it comes to food, fill the majority of your plate with lots of veggies and any proteins that aren’t battered, fried, or cheese covered. Then when it comes to the good stuff, skip anything that you aren’t DYING to have and include small portions of only the things you REALLY want.</p>
<p><strong>Avoid “BLT’S”</strong><br />
We aren’t talking about the sandwich. We are talking about those little bites, licks, and tastes. A handful of chips as you pass by the bowl, just one more piece of pizza, only a small taste of that buffalo dip, and sneaking a cube of cheese every time you pass by, could easily ALL ADD UP to a full day worth of calories (or more.)</p>
<p>One way to avoid “grazing” is after you make your plate, instead of eating everything all at once, nibble off of the plate you made for yourself. Once it’s empty .. that’s it, no more!</p>
<p><strong>Stay away from the buffet</strong><br />
The problem with parties is that the food stays out for hours! It’s always there waiting for you to have a BLT! Avoidance is the best strategy. After you fill your plate walk away and DO NOT RETURN!</p>
<p>Drink water, chew gum, stay occupied! Whatever you do, don’t head back into that penalty zone! Remember to graze off your plate, not the food spread!</p>
<p><strong>Actually watch the game</strong><br />
And the commercials..and the half-time show…Remember WHY you are surrounded by all that food to begin. Get into the game, jump up and down, and cheer on your team.</p>
<p>If you aren’t into sports but are going to a party anyway, find other ways to stay busy by keeping the conversation going with friends or even ask someone to take it outside for some yard games or a walk around the block. If you are busy socializing, you won’t be thinking about casually making your way back to the buffet!</p>
<p><em><strong>THE GAME IS OVER … Do Not Penalize Yourself</strong></em></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-6722" src="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/superbowl-game-over.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/superbowl-game-over.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/superbowl-game-over.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/superbowl-game-over.jpeg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/superbowl-game-over.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/superbowl-game-over.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /><br />
Even if your team wins, if you lost your food battle, you will most likely wake up on Monday with a flood of negative thoughts.</p>
<p>This is <strong>NEVER</strong> a good place to be!</p>
<p>Feelings of guilt can cause you to do some crazy things, like give up altogether, or think you have no chance at bouncing back.</p>
<p>DO NOT let these thoughts cause you to give up! Let’s use one of the biggest Super Bowl blunders of all time as an example.</p>
<p>At Super Bowl XXXVII, just as the game was coming to an end, the Panthers managed to tie the score. But then John Kasey booted the kickoff out of bounds, giving the Patriots the ball at their own 40-yard line, allowing Tom Brady to step in and win the game!</p>
<p>Do you think Kasey called it quits and retired because of one bad plan? NO!! He went on to play seven more seasons with the Panthers.</p>
<p>Whatever choices you made, do not replay your game-day decisions. You consumed it… MOVE ON!</p>
<p>And by move on, we DO NOT mean that you should attempt any kind of “damage control.” You can not and should not try to restrict calories or attempt to punish yourself in an attempt to “work off” the calories you consumed.</p>
<p>I mean, come on, what are you gonna do? Run 60 miles?? That is more than two back-to-back marathons, yet that is what it would take to even <em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">potentially</span></em> “burn” six thousand extra calories!</p>
<p>Don’t let your mind go there! It’s not healthy, and the outcome will BACKFIRE!</p>
<p>Even if you attempt to “work off” the calories consumed, all you will really do is stress out your body. This could wreak havoc on your hormones and hinder your body&#8217;s ability to recover properly. These things can actually stall weight-loss or even cause weight gain!</p>
<p>The best plan of action is to just <strong>GET BACK ON TRACK</strong>!</p>
<p>A great way to get back on track fast is with the help of Sculpt Nation’s fat-melting, muscle building supplements.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Something magical happens after the clock strikes midnight, and you enter into a new year.</p>
<p>Your brain somehow develops this SUPER POWER where you have a sudden urge<br />
to say .. THIS IS MY YEAR. You become flooded with a surge of motivation to stop making excuses and get in shape.</p>
<p>There is a psychological name for this sensation. It’s called the “Fresh Start Effect.”<br />
The rest of us call it&#8230; a New Year’s Resolution.</p>
<p>The problem with a New Year’s Resolution is that our New Year’s hangover tends to last longer.</p>
<p>No matter how good intentions are, the vast majority of people fail before they even start, or will give up within a few days or weeks.</p>
<p><strong>There are many reasons this happens…</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>You know WHAT you want but haven’t established exactly WHY you want it.</li>
<li>You fall for some overly restrictive “fad” diet.</li>
<li>You want a “fast fix.”</li>
<li>You choose an exercise program that doesn’t match your lifestyle or schedule.</li>
<li>You have unrealistic expectations/goals.</li>
<li>You are relying on this “fresh start effect” (i.e.,motivation), which WILL NOT last.</li>
<li>You do not have any direction, support, or help.</li>
<li>You aren’t really ready to change.</li>
</ul>
<p>We want to tell you that THIS DOES NOT HAVE TO BE YOU!<br />
No matter what has happened in years past, YOU are in control of what happens THIS year!</p>
<p>We are here to help make sure your “fresh start effect” is actually .. EFFECTIVE!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Here are FIVE tips that will pave the way and get you starting 2020 in the right direction!</strong></p>
<p><img class="size-large wp-image-6632" src="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/AdobeStock_265026485.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/AdobeStock_265026485.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/AdobeStock_265026485.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/AdobeStock_265026485.jpeg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/AdobeStock_265026485.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/AdobeStock_265026485.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>HAVE A CLEAR WHY.</strong><br />
You have to give your goals some direction. It is impossible to stay committed if you don’t know exactly WHY you are doing WHAT you are doing.</p>
<p>Establish a very specific reason WHY you want to change. Once you do this, you are giving your goals POWER!</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>DON’T .. Be Vague.</strong><br />
Saying “I don’t want to be overweight anymore” &#8211; “I want to get shredded” &#8211; “I want to be strong” &#8211; “I want to have more self-esteem” &#8211; is not SPECIFIC enough.<br />
DIG DEEPER and pinpoint your EXACT reason for wanting change.</li>
<li><strong>DO .. Watch Your Words.</strong><br />
Always speak with positivity! Replacing the word “want” with “will” and never use negative phrasing such as “fat” &#8211; “lazy” &#8211; “failure,” etc.</li>
<li><strong>DON’T .. Be Completely Vain.</strong><br />
Of course, you will have purely physical reasons for wanting to get fit, and that is OKAY! But try to think beyond aesthetics. There are many other reasons to get in shape! Things like disease prevention, a longer life, better sleep, healthy joints, improved mood, better self-esteem, even better SEX!</li>
</ul>
<p>There isn’t a right or wrong answer when it comes to establishing your why. Just make sure it has deep enough meaning to be your driving force on the days you want to throw in the towel.</p>
<p><strong>DITCH THE EXCUSES.</strong><br />
<em>It’s too cold.</em><br />
<em>I’m too busy.</em><br />
<em>I can’t afford a gym membership.</em><br />
<em>I don’t know what I’m doing or where to start.</em><br />
<em>I don’t have time to meal prep.</em><br />
<em>I’ve failed every single time I’ve tried in the past.</em><br />
<em>Everyone in my family is overweight; it’s my genetics.</em><br />
<em>I have a bad back.</em><br />
<em>I hate cardio.</em><br />
<em>I love carbs.</em></p>
<p>If any of these phrases sound familiar, join the club! We have ALL been there.<br />
Anyone can find a reason NOT to get started, to not push through, or not keep going.</p>
<p>Excuses are rarely justified. If you want it bad enough, you will ditch all the reasons you think you can’t.</p>
<p>Stop rationalizing!<br />
Start taking responsibility for your life!<br />
Refuse to let excuses be an option!</p>
<p><strong>LEARN THE ART OF DISCIPLINE.</strong><br />
Motivation is a term frequently thrown around in the fitness space, but it is NOT what you really need to have long-term success. What you need .. is DISCIPLINE!</p>
<p>Motivation is a NOUN. You can’t choose it or control it.<br />
Discipline is a VERB. It is choice-action.</p>
<p>Discipline is a way of life that is learned over time. It’s forcing yourself to do something you may not want to do (but know you need to do) until it becomes a habit. Repetition over and over again is what creates discipline.</p>
<p>Discipline will get you up, dressed, and training, even if there is a blizzard outside. Motivation is hit or miss. You can’t rely on it in these situations. When you have discipline it doesn’t matter if you are motivated. You just .. do it!</p>
<p>Let your motivation INSPIRE YOU, especially with the new year when your positive attitude is in over-drive. Take advantage of it when you have it, but know that you cannot rely on it!</p>
<p>It takes, on average, about a month for a new habit to form.<br />
It takes double, or even triple, that amount of time for it to stick and become AUTOMATIC.<br />
In other words, discipline won’t happen overnight.<br />
Be patient!</p>
<p><strong>SET GOALS.</strong><br />
Goals are crucial. But your goals must be attainable and specific.</p>
<p>When a goal is vague, it can seem overwhelming and leave room for limitations. When a goal is specific, it paints a clear picture of exactly what you want.</p>
<p>Here are a couple of examples of <em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">SPECIFIC GOALS:</span></em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>“I will run six days a week so that in 4 weeks, I will be able to run a mile in 7 minutes.”</em></li>
<li><em>“I will lose body fat by consistently hitting the gym five days a week, doing cardio three days a week, and sticking to my nutrition plan daily.”</em></li>
</ul>
<p>We want you to have BIG GOALS, but you must START SMALL.</p>
<p>If you attempt to go all-in too fast, you will likely experience burn-out, or set yourself up with unrealistic expectations.<br />
Look at your long term goal, but then break that down into smaller goals. Celebrate each small victory and then move on to the next!</p>
<p>You should also be honest about your capabilities and set your goals accordingly. If you know you won’t be able to commit to 6 days in the gym, don’t pick a workout program that requires that sort of structure. If you HATE the idea of going to a gym, find a training plan that allows you to workout from home. If you know you love carbs way too much to cut them out, don’t try to force yourself into the “Keto Club.”</p>
<p>There isn’t “one way” to approach fitness .. the best way is one that will work for YOU!</p>
<p>One final GOAL tip… get them out of your head and write them down! Keep your goals somewhere you can look at them often!</p>
<p><strong>DON’T DO IT ALONE.</strong><br />
Get a gym buddy, join a group fitness class, and/or reach out to our experienced team of trainers here at V Shred.</p>
<p>Going in “alone” and “blind” could cause you to get frustrated and lose all that initial motivation real fast. If you have a general idea of what you are doing and have a few accountability partners by your side, your success rate will skyrocket!</p>
<p>Also, do not be afraid to speak up! Tell everyone you know about your new journey and say it with EXCITEMENT!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>YOU CAN do this!!</strong></p>
<p>Here are a few NEXT STEPS to help you get moving in the right direction!</p>
<p>FIRST .. pick your plan! There are dozens of diets and exercise programs out there. It can be confusing when trying to decide which is best. A great starting point would be to take or <a href="https://vshred.com/sp/survey/survey-aka1/">FREE BODY TYPE QUIZ</a>. Once you get your results, you will have a better idea of the exercise and nutrition plan you should pursue to see OPTIMAL results!</p>
<p>NEXT .. plan ahead! Go ahead and figure out the gym you want to join. You may even want to join early so that you can get an idea of equipment available, floorplan, etc. If you plan to work out from home, order anything you may need to have a proper set-up and familiarize yourself with some of our videos on our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCOFCwvhDoUvYcfpD7RJKQwA">YouTube Channel</a>.</p>
<p>You will also want to make sure you have all your supplements on hand on day one!<br />

<p>You can always add things to your supplement regime, but here a few staples we suggest, no matter your fitness level or goals.</p>
<p><a href="https://sculptnation.com/product/protein/"><strong>Sculpt Nation Protein</strong></a>: Protein is the MOST vital macronutrient in your nutrition plan, and you can only eat so many chicken breasts and egg whites! Our 90% Non-GMO Whey Isolate is a great (and delicious) way to ensure you hit your daily protein numbers. You can even get creative and make it into yummy creations, like <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/pumpkin-spice-protein/">pancakes</a>!</p>
<p><a href="https://sculptnation.com/product/greens/"><strong>Sculpt Nation Greens</strong></a>: Even those that adhere to the “healthiest” of diets do not get enough variety to give their bodies the nutrients it needs. When you don’t take care of your body from the inside out, you are not giving it the fuel it needs to thrive!! Incorporate a daily scoop of our greens. You will experience better digestion, more energy, better fat loss, decreased inflammation, healthier joints, glowing skin, and more!</p>
<p><a href="https://sculptnation.com/product/pre-workout/"><strong>Sculpt Nation PRE</strong></a>: We all need a little kick some days.

Our PRE gives you a jolt of natural energy, as well as a variety of nootropics and other super-ingredients, that will result in razor focus, more strength, killer pumps, and increased metabolism and fat mobilization. All without any jitters or crash!</p>
<p><a href="https://sculptnation.com/product/post-workout-fruit-punch/"><strong>Sculpt Nation POST</strong></a>: You need to quickly supply your body with very specific nutrients after you train so that it can begin recovering as soon as possible!

<p><a href="https://sculptnation.com/shop/"><strong>Don’t forget to use code: NYE2020 at checkout to get 40% off!</strong></a></p>
<p><strong><em>LAST</em> .. get excited!</strong> If you dread the road ahead, you are already setting yourself up for failure. If you have a positive mindset before your feet hit the ground running, you are speaking positivity over your life, and success is more likely to follow!</p>
<p>2020 CAN be the year you stick to your New Year’s Resolution to be healthy!</p>
<ul>
<li>RECOGNIZE you need to make a change.</li>
<li>DECIDE you are going to do what it takes to change.</li>
<li>SPEAK positive words about the road ahead.</li>
<li>TAKE ACTION to make it happen.</li>

<p>Are You Ready? It’s Black Friday and it’s about to get crazy.</p>
<p>It’s the biggest shopping day of the year and you need to be prepared. From finding the perfect deals, planning your timing, waiting in long lines and lasting the full day&#8230;every part of the process needs to be tactically planned.</p>
<p>This “holiday” draws hordes of people out for a full day of shopping. If you’re a Black Friday shopper, try these tips to help you have a healthy shopping experience.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Prepare Your Body!</strong></h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Eat a Healthy Breakfast. </strong>This will help you stay energized throughout the day and keep you from binging on easily accessible fast food. <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/skinny-protein-pumpkin-muffins-recipe-for-thanksgiving/">If you need a quick and healthy breakfast recipe check out this low carb protein pumpkin recipe.</a> It doubles as a quick but filling breakfast and you can take some with you to snack on throughout the day.</li>
<li><strong>Wear Comfortable Clothing.<br />
</strong>You&#8217;ll be battling crowds and possibly stampedes of other shoppers fighting to get their sale items so comfortable and appropriate clothing is a must. Wear closed-toed comfortable shoes since you will be doing a lot of walking and to avoid your toes getting stepped on in the crowded stores.If you&#8217;re carrying a purse consider using a cross-body bag instead, you will avoid pickpocketers and be able to hang onto your personal belongings better.</li>
<li><strong>Get The Energy Boost You&#8217;ll Need.</strong><br />
On Black Friday you might feel exhausted. Thanksgiving can be tiring and chances are you were up early to start shopping. One dose of <a href="https://sculptnation.com/product/burn-fat-burner/"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Sculpt Nations BURN</strong></span></a> will give your body the boost it needs to help you burn off those extra Thanksgiving dinner calories and give you sustainable energy throughout the day.<strong><a href="https://sculptnation.com/product/burn-fat-burner/"> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Snag yourself a bottle for a whopping 50%</span> off</a> when you use coupon code: GAINS50 at checkout</strong> <em>(no fighting the crowds here)</p>
<p></em></li>
<li><strong>Hydrate.<br />
</strong>Drink plenty of water while shopping. It&#8217;s easy to get caught up in the Black Friday madness and dehydrate yourself by forgetting to drink water. Make sure you are giving yourself the proper fuel to run your body and keep hydrated.</li>
<li><strong>Pre-Pack Snacks.</strong><br />
There&#8217;s no doubt about it. You WILL be waiting in long lines today. Including lines at the food court. Having healthy snacks on hand will help you maintain your stamina, save you time, and money as well as prevent you from opting for unhealthier food options.</li>
<li><strong>Rest Up And Get A Good Night&#8217;s Sleep</strong>.<br />
After a long day of battling the crowds for those big savings, you will be physically and mentally exhausted. Help your body restore itself by getting the best sleep possible. <a href="https://sculptnation.com/product/burn-pm/"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Sculpt Nation’s BURN PM</strong></span></a> thermogenic formula includes powerful natural sleep enhancers to help you enjoy a deep sleep as well as helping your body to burn excess fat around the clock.<strong><a href="https://sculptnation.com/product/burn-pm/"> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Recover from your intense day of shopping and grab yourself a bottle of BURN PM 50% off</span></a> when you use coupon code: GAINS50 at checkout!</strong></li>
