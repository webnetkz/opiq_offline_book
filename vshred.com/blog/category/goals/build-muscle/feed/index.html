								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Most successful weight-loss transformation stories start with an “aha” moment. That sudden shift in mindset that pushes someone to stop coming up with every reason why they can’t do something and instead take the first step towards making a lasting change.</p>
<p>Dylan’s personal story of tragedy, and weight loss then muscle-gain triumph with V Shred will inspire you.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-7526 size-full" src="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/117163427_4254430027932957_2001345014807689283_n.jpg?resize=960%2C960&#038;ssl=1" alt="Dylan's V Shred weight-loss transformation before, during, after photo" width="960" height="960" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/117163427_4254430027932957_2001345014807689283_n.jpg?w=960&amp;ssl=1 960w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/117163427_4254430027932957_2001345014807689283_n.jpg?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 150w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/117163427_4254430027932957_2001345014807689283_n.jpg?resize=300%2C300&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/117163427_4254430027932957_2001345014807689283_n.jpg?resize=768%2C768&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/117163427_4254430027932957_2001345014807689283_n.jpg?resize=60%2C60&amp;ssl=1 60w" sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>For 28-year-old Dylan, his “aha” moment was a combination of his own life set-backs that resulted in weight gain and depression. When those were coupled with the sudden loss of his brother and surviving a natural disaster (on the same day) he knew it was time for a change.</p>
<p>Dylan grew up a football star. Everything was going as planned through high school until he lost a university scholarship and his dreams were crushed. <em>“I went to work, came home, and sat in front of the TV. That was pretty much it.”</em> for years after, explains Dylan.</p>
<p>At an unhealthy 355 pounds, the mental and physical misery Dylan felt every day still wasn’t enough to push him to do something about it. The depression told him he was too far gone. <em>“I didn’t go out because I hated the way I looked. I wouldn’t take my shirt off, even for my girlfriend. It was hard because I used to be this person that was athletic and outgoing. I knew I let myself go, but I thought at that point, there was no fixing it.”</em></p>
<p>The year 2017 was a dark period and the lowest point of Dylan’s life. He saw he was headed in the same direction as someone else he loved. “<em>My brother had depression and substance abuse issues. He was even bigger than I was, and his depression was brought on by his weight. He wasn&#8217;t happy with himself.”</em></p>
<h2>A Day That Changed Everything</h2>
<p>On September 10, 2017 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Irma">Hurricane Irma</a> hit Dylan’s home state of Florida. On the very same day his brother committed suicide. <em>“I swore at that moment, I wasn&#8217;t going to turn into that.”</em></p>
<p>It was the perfect storm to create a lightning bolt moment (his aha.) Dylan knew he had to make a change. His life depended on it.</p>
<p>Scared, and even a little intimidated, Dylan decided to take the first step of his weight-loss transformation. “I&#8217;d seen V Shred almost every single day for two weeks, and I finally clicked the ad, and it was the best thing I ever did.”</p>
<h2>Starting A Weight-Loss Transformation With V Shred</h2>
<p>The former football star knew <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/strength-training/">how to lift weights</a> with a coach screaming down his neck, but had no clue how to workout by himself. Being in the gym, alone, without a coach or teammates was entirely different. As he started to learn more about nutrition in those early days Dylan also realized he didn’t have the slightest clue about cardio or nutrition.</p>
<p>Thankfully, he didn’t have to learn everything alone. The <a href="https://vshred.com/programs/fat-loss-extreme?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=male-motivation-testimonial&amp;utm_content=FLE-male-zee.j&amp;utm_term=5">V Shred Fat Loss Extreme</a> plan laid everything out for him. He simply had to put in the work. <em>“I had an extreme goal. I wanted to lose a hundred pounds within a year. I blew that out the water. I got on pace to where I already knew I was going to hit my goal, and I just kept going.”</em></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-7596 size-full" src="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/24AC0918-158B-4FCE-9E61-6D7A1EE801B0_1_201_a.jpeg?resize=750%2C870&#038;ssl=1" alt="Dylan's V Shred Fat Loss Extreme weight-loss transformation After photo" width="750" height="870" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/24AC0918-158B-4FCE-9E61-6D7A1EE801B0_1_201_a.jpeg?w=750&amp;ssl=1 750w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/24AC0918-158B-4FCE-9E61-6D7A1EE801B0_1_201_a.jpeg?resize=259%2C300&amp;ssl=1 259w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>Dylan also found a lot of help from the V Shred community online, which gave him support and new ideas for exercises and <a href="https://vshred.com/sp/recipe-guide/v1?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=socialmedia&amp;utm_campaign=male-motivation-testimonial&amp;utm_content=FLE-male-zee.j&amp;utm_term=5">recipes</a>. <em>“The V Shred Group “is like Google! It’s constantly refreshing itself for me. Everybody’s in the same mindset that I&#8217;m in, searching without me even having to search.”</em></p>
<p>In his first year with V Shred, Dylan dropped 135 pounds. But his transformation didn’t stop there. He got all the way down to 180 pounds!</p>
<p>After a grand total of 155 pounds lost, Dylan decided to end his weight loss journey, but not in the way you may think.</p>
<h2>Changing His Goals &amp; Changing His Mindset</h2>
<p>Dylan decided to do something that may have been even harder than the initial weight loss.</p>
<p>He started <a href="https://vshred.com/programs/clean-bulk-program?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=socialmedia&amp;utm_campaign=male-motivation-testimonial&amp;utm_content=FLE-male-zee.j&amp;utm_term=5">V Shred&#8217;s Clean Bulk Program</a> to build the muscle needed to reshape his new skinnier body. <em>“I developed body dysmorphia. I became afraid of eating too much. So going from losing all that weight to knowing I have to eat in a surplus and gain weight was a struggle for me.”</em></p>
<p>Dylan quickly learned that his V Shred coaches knew what they were doing. They had a weight-loss transformation plan that would allow him to build muscle without gaining a ton of excess fat.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-7597 size-full" src="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/0AF6A317-A447-4CC1-AEDB-18CA271B8EF2_1_201_a.jpeg?resize=750%2C744&#038;ssl=1" alt="Dylan's V Shred Clean Bulk weight-loss transformation and muscle gain After photo" width="750" height="744" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/0AF6A317-A447-4CC1-AEDB-18CA271B8EF2_1_201_a.jpeg?w=750&amp;ssl=1 750w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/0AF6A317-A447-4CC1-AEDB-18CA271B8EF2_1_201_a.jpeg?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 150w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/0AF6A317-A447-4CC1-AEDB-18CA271B8EF2_1_201_a.jpeg?resize=300%2C298&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/0AF6A317-A447-4CC1-AEDB-18CA271B8EF2_1_201_a.jpeg?resize=60%2C60&amp;ssl=1 60w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>After a 3 year journey with V Shred, Dylan sits at 210 pounds of lean muscle.</p>
<p>But the external transformation is only half of his life-changing results. Dylan is a new man both inside and out. He has developed confidence and a fresh zest for the life he shares with his fiancé and two kids.</p>
<p>Dylan’s weight-loss transformation, however, hasn’t come without setbacks. COVID limitations made it hard to hit heavy weights, and over Labor Day weekend, he had an accident that dislodged two ribs!</p>
<p>Instead of getting down about not being able to lift heavy enough to continue his bulk, he shifted his mindset. Dylan decided that he would attempt his very first “cut” using <a href="https://vshred.com/sp/ripped-in-90-days/sku_AR6nTj3PTK3uu9?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=male-motivation-testimonial&amp;utm_content=FLE-male-zee.j&amp;utm_term=5">V Shred Ripped In 90 Days</a>. We can’t wait to see his next set of transformation pictures!!</p>
<p>Dylan&#8217;s advice to anyone scared of or too hesitant to purchase a plan is this …</p>
<p><em>“Everyone asks me “the secret”. You have the basic responses; diet is key and hit the gym hard. But those are common knowledge. <strong>There is one thing that is going to get you the results you want &#8211; eliminate the excuses!</strong> The “I’m tired., I’ll go harder tomorrow” or “I can’t find the time” won’t work, and will only hold you back. V Shred is a building block (and an amazing one at that). With all the information, the support, and this group, you 100% can achieve your goal. Get grinding guys, and keep reaching your goals and making new ones!”</em></p>

That is a scary number!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Good thing you found this article because </span><b><i>we aren’t going to let YOU be “most” people! </i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lower temps do not have to equal larger waistlines! You just have to have a plan! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this short read we will &#8230;</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Explain why winter weight gain happens. Knowing why is important if you want to prevent it and the reason is probably not what you think. In fact, it is partially not even your fault!</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tell you why fall/winter is actually the BEST time to start a diet and training plan.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Give you 7 easy pro tips that will help guide you through the next few months. </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You may believe winter weight gain happens because of the holidays. Those extra home cooked meals and holiday parties are certainly a factor. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But </span><b><i>there is a DAILY issue you need to be prepared to fight </i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">if you want to avoid packing on winter pounds.</span></p>
<p><b>WHY YOU REALLY PACK ON POUNDS AFTER LABOR DAY</b></p>
<p><img class="size-large wp-image-7471" src="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_130930953.jpeg?resize=1024%2C512&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="512" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_130930953.jpeg?resize=1024%2C512&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_130930953.jpeg?resize=300%2C150&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_130930953.jpeg?resize=768%2C384&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_130930953.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_130930953.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the spring and summer months, you are given what we call a</span><b> fitness freebie. </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You get a </span><b><i>seasonal motivation boost</i></b> <span style="font-weight: 400;">that doesn’t happen when temperatures start to drop, and you begin to pull out the chunky sweaters and comfy leggings. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not only is the sun shining (which makes you happier because of Vitamin D), you are wearing LESS clothing in the summer months. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I don’t know about you, but knowing I’m going to be exposing more skin makes walking in the gym a little easier. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Covering up in layers, no doubt leads to the temptation to slack on body goals! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Knowing your arms, legs, and abs will be less exposed can easily be an excuse to slack. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, being layered up often means you don’t SEE the extra pounds, so they are easier to ignore.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But there is more to it than being bundled up….</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-7477" src="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_236518834.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_236518834.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_236518834.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_236518834.jpeg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_236518834.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_236518834.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span>The #1 reason you slack on health and fitness goals in colder months ISN’T EVEN YOUR FAULT!!</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, you have a part to play in all of this, but</span><b><i> there is actually a scientific reason why you have less desire to train and eat healthy when the sunshine of summer fades.</i></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We will explain why a little further down. But ya know what really stinks? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The scientific reason why we all experience these motivation slumps in the winter only adds to an even bigger issue with motivation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span>It doesn’t matter what season it is motivation ALWAYS comes and goes!</p>
<p>Spring, Summer, Fall, or Winter &#8211; you can NEVER rely on it!</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, what can you do when lack of sunshine and warm temps leave you even more tempted to hit snooze and reach for comfort foods? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You certainly don’t throw your hands up in the air and wait until January to make a resolution to crash diet to get your body ready for spring. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Believe it or not, RIGHT NOW is actually the IDEAL time to get started! </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you </span><b><i>START NOW, </i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">you will develop discipline and a routine heading into the holidays. This will put you in a great place mentally and physically to relax and “indulge” a little more at all those holiday gatherings! </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><b><i>Look at it this way ..<br />
</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Would you rather head into the holiday season already making progress toward your goals and be in a great spot <em>(where it would be okay even if you did gain an extra pound or two?)</em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Or would you rather put it off and only add more fat on top of what you want to lose?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The answer is clear— the solution to getting the motivation needed to make it happen, not so much.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But don’t worry! We’ve got ya covered</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (no pun intended)</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with a few easy motivation hacks!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><b>7 TIPS TO STAY MOTIVATED AS SEASONS CHANGE</b></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><b><br />
</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the number one questions we always get is … “<em>I am just not motivated. How can I motivate myself to train and eat better?”</em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As we mentioned earlier, it doesn&#8217;t matter what season it is, </span><b><i>you can’t always rely on motivation. </i></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you have it, great! You should certainly take advantage of it! But you have to know that it is totally normal to not have much of it. Even professional athletes lack motivation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You have to develop other daily habits that create discipline if you want to succeed long term!</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are a few of our pro tips that we use with our clients, specifically when temperatures drop, and motivation seems to be at its lowest! </span></p>
<p><b>TIP #1: Switch To An At Home Training Program</b></p>
<p><img class="size-large wp-image-7448" src="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_185038762.jpeg?resize=1024%2C647&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="647" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_185038762.jpeg?resize=1024%2C647&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_185038762.jpeg?resize=300%2C189&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_185038762.jpeg?resize=768%2C485&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_185038762.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_185038762.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you know that getting out of bed and stepping into the winter elements is going to be an excuse trigger, make a plan to train at home during cooler months! Some of the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">most effective and challenging workouts </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">only require your body weight and </span><b><i>maybe</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a set of dumbbells or some resistance bands.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A good fat-blasting, muscle-building sweat session can 100% be achieved from the comfort of your home!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adjustable dumbbells, ankle weights, resistance bands, a jump rope, etc., are all things that are inexpensive and can easily be stored in a closet or under your bed and pulled out anytime you don’t feel like leaving the house.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But if you have </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">the right training program</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><b><i>you don’t need any of that. </i></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our favorite </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">at-home bodyweight-only program</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is called</span><b> MOVE. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was designed to help you achieve your fitness goals without a single piece of equipment, and each workout is under 20 minutes! </span></p>

<p><b>TIP #2: Make Your Workouts Seasonal</b></p>
<p><img class="size-large wp-image-7452" src="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_65703942.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_65703942.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_65703942.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_65703942.jpeg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_65703942.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_65703942.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Embrace the change of seasons and take advantage of activities that you can only do in fall or winter! </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Go on a fall hike and view all the gorgeous foliage.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Try rock climbing.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Walk around a corn maze or pumpkin patch with your family. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you live in a snowy climate, go skiing, sledding, build snowmen with your kids, etc.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Go ice skating.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lace-up your sneakers, go for a walk or run at night, and admire all the Christmas lights and decorations.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are some things you can only do and see during specific times of the year. So instead of missing sunshine and water sports, focus on all the positive things that only come about with cooler temps!</span></p>
<p><b>TIP #3: Try Something Totally New</b></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-7454" src="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_361152601.jpeg?resize=1024%2C514&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="514" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_361152601.jpeg?resize=1024%2C514&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_361152601.jpeg?resize=300%2C151&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_361152601.jpeg?resize=768%2C386&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_361152601.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_361152601.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sometimes a change of routine is all you need to boost motivation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you have been doing all your gym lifts alone, recruit a gym buddy! Try switching up your cardio by skipping your solo runs and joining a group fitness class instead. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another option is to </span><b><i>allow yourself to slow down!</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> If you have been crushing it all spring and summer with intense training and hardcore workouts, </span><b><i>it may actually be time to take it down a notch. </i></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Going full force 365 can cause your stress hormone cortisol to increase. This can lead to a host of drawbacks, including weight gain, muscle loss, poor moods, fatigue, and occasional issues sleeping! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We aren’t saying you should become lazy! But if you have been crushing it 24/7 all spring and summer, your body (and mind) may need to slow down.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Use the next few months to embrace a slower routine. </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Commit to daily yoga.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Focus on becoming more flexible.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Switch to low or moderate-intensity cardio, instead of HIIT.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Try out some bodyweight workouts instead of heavy lifting.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Giving your body a couple of months to recover might even make you more responsive when you decide to kick things up again come spring/summer!</span></p>
<p><b>TIP #4: Stay Accountable</b></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-7457" src="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_266584820.jpeg?resize=1024%2C768&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="768" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_266584820.jpeg?resize=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_266584820.jpeg?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_266584820.jpeg?resize=768%2C576&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_266584820.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_266584820.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><b><br />
</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">The best way to stick to a plan is to have someone that you report back to. This could be a friend, family member, a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">social media community</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, or even a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">coach. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Including someone else, or even just telling someone else about your health and fitness goals and asking them to check in with you to make sure you are sticking to the plan, is a great way to keep the promises you make to yourself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you prefer to fly solo, it helps to create visuals. Make a vision board, create a daily checklist you can mark off after each workout, or keep an accomplishment journal.</span></p>
<p><b>TIP #5: Set A Spring Goal</b></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-7458" src="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_47332240.jpeg?resize=1024%2C680&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="680" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_47332240.jpeg?resize=1024%2C680&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_47332240.jpeg?resize=300%2C199&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_47332240.jpeg?resize=768%2C510&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_47332240.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_47332240.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">March may seem like a long time away, but it will be back before you know it, and 6 months is a long time to make significant changes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Setting a goal is a great way to encourage yourself to push past discomforts and temptation, but there is a science to goal setting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The key to creating goals that stick .. </span><b><i>be REALISTIC and SPECIFIC!</i></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s start with </span><b><i>reality. </i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">You should always focus on one goal at a time and make sure you are being honest with yourself if that goal is really attainable.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you know that your schedule will never allow you to work out 6 days a week, why would you choose a program that requires you to do that?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you know it’s not healthy to attempt to lose 10 pounds a week, why would you aim that high?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you love carbs, why would you go on a KETO diet? </span></p>
<p><b><i>Doing these things will essentially set yourself up for failure.</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Set attainable goals that fit YOUR lifestyle. You can always bump things up if your schedule allows, or you notice you aren’t pushing yourself hard enough. Just keep in mind that being realistic isn’t the same as not believing in yourself or making excuses. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moving on to being </span><b><i>specific.</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The more specific you are about your goals, the more likely you will be to reach them. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It may seem like it’s good enough to say things like .. I want to look good, lose weight, or get ripped! </span><b><i>But you have to dig deeper than that!! </i></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wanting to “lose weight,” for example, is an excellent place to start. But ask yourself what that means to you?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you expand on that and say &#8212; “I want to lose 10 pounds of fat. I will do this by not eating any sweets and doing the V Shred </span><a href="https://vshred.com/sp/move/soc-all/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><b>MOVE </b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">program for 30 consecutive days. I am doing this because I want to have better self-esteem and a head start on bikini season.” &#8212; that makes your goal more specific.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The more specific (and attainable) your goals are, the more likely you will be to not give up!</span></p>
<p><b>TIP #6: Reward Yourself</b></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-7459" src="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/vin_sant_32048508_366936073798151_433609263865135104_n.jpg?resize=882%2C1024&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="882" height="1024" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/vin_sant_32048508_366936073798151_433609263865135104_n.jpg?resize=882%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 882w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/vin_sant_32048508_366936073798151_433609263865135104_n.jpg?resize=258%2C300&amp;ssl=1 258w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/vin_sant_32048508_366936073798151_433609263865135104_n.jpg?resize=768%2C892&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/vin_sant_32048508_366936073798151_433609263865135104_n.jpg?w=1080&amp;ssl=1 1080w" sizes="(max-width: 882px) 100vw, 882px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you have checked a “mini goal” off your list, treat yourself. Knowing that you have a reward coming to celebrate your efforts will make you want to achieve it even more. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It may be tempting to make your reward one of your favorite “forbidden foods” but we never suggest that you reward yourself this way.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You aren’t a dog. You should never reward “good behavior” with food. Having this mentality can create a really unhealthy relationship with food.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You need to eat healthy MOST of the time, control your portions, and see food as fuel. But if you are craving something that isn’t quite as healthy as your grilled chicken and rice, never feel like you need to lose 20 pounds to “deserve” a bite of cake, or nice dinner out with your family. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instead of rewarding yourself with food, buy yourself something you have been wanting. Maybe some new workout clothes, a massage, or an extra $20 bucks in your vacation fund! </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Earlier, we mentioned that cold weather motivation dips may not be your fault.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’m sure you have heard of winter blues. Well, it’s a real thing. Less natural light can cause dips in serotonin, the neurotransmitter that regulates mood.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The dark and dreary days of winter can also cause your body to produce more of the sleep hormone melatonin. This shift can disrupt your body and impact your sleep patterns and overall mood.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are a few ways that you can focus on improving your mental health.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Invest in a light therapy box that simulates natural daylight.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Make sure you are supplementing with or eating plenty of foods with Vitamin D.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Start journaling. There is a lot of scientific evidence that supports putting your thoughts on paper provides a long list of benefits, including stress management, self-confidence, and goal setting. </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Suppose you still find yourself struggling with negative seasonal motivation shifts. In that case, you may need to experiment with taking</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> naturally sourced herbs</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to help support brain health and a positive mood.</span></p>
<p><b><i>Here are a few with some great scientific backing to help boost mood.</i></b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>EnXtra: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">A natural caffeine-free patent-pending botanical ingredient that has been shown to help increase dopamine levels.**It is also one of the first and only natural caffeine-free patent-pending botanical ingredients shown to boost mental alertness &amp; acuity for hours or ending in a huge caffeine energy crash.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Piper Nigrum Fruit Extract:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> A very specific type of black pepper that has been shown to help increase both serotonin and dopamine.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>L-Theanine:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> A powerful amino acid that is believed to help reduce occasional anxiety brought on by stressful situations.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can find all of these natural herbs (plus 3 more) in a one of a kind supplement called </span><b><a href="https://sculptnation.com/neuroctane/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NEUROCTANE</a>. </b></p>

<p><b><i>BOTTOM LINE IF YOU WANT TO STAY MOTIVATED YEAR ROUND</i></b><b><i><br />
</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you put away the shorts and swimsuits and shift out of bikini season, it’s common for motivation to “fall back” with the clocks. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The seasons have to change (unless you live near the equator) &#8211; so you have to figure out ways to</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">not let your fitness goals go into hibernation mode!</span><b><i> </i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pumpkin spice lattes are only here for a limited time, but getting into shape isn’t seasonal! </span><i>It&#8217;s a year-round commitment!!</i><i> </i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Combining Sculpt Nation supplements with V Shred&#8217;s diet and training programs is a great way to get a head start on keeping those winter pounds at bay this year. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>This combo has helped tens of thousands of happy customers reach their goals faster and easier!</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you wanna lose that belly fat and get ripped six pack abs, you don&#8217;t need to hire an expensive personal trainer or go to the gym. All you need to do is get a dumbbell and follow these workout routines!</p>
<h2>Weighted Ab Workout For A Ripped Six Pack Abs</h2>
<h3></h3>
<h3>Start With Your Gut</h3>
<p><!-- instagram error: invalid instagram resource --></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">When it comes to getting ripped six pack abs, there’s one thing you should not overlook. Diet. So before you try this workout, if you’re not sure <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/healthy-eating-mistakes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">what you should be eating</a> in order to really chisel your abs, take my free body type quiz to learn the 3 most important things to do to see results.</span></p>
<div>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://vshred.com/sp/survey/survey-aka1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="s1">Click Here To Take The Free Body Type Quiz!</span></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Once your <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/healthy-eating-mistakes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">dietary concerns</a> are out of the way, it’s time to train those abs! Abs are just like any other muscle group, but smaller than most. That means you need to train them and let them recover just like any other muscle. So we recommend doing this weighted ab workout no more than every other day making sure to allow your abdominal muscles to recover completely.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">All you will need for this workout is a single dumbbell. You may pick the weight of your choice or use no weight at all (this depends on your physical capability) and do as follows:</span></p>
<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1">The Workout</span></h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There are four total exercises and for each exercise, you will do 4 sets of 10-15 reps with only 20 seconds of rest in-between. If you cannot handle this layout, you may extend your rest period slightly or break the sets into “mini sets” but make sure to complete the same total number of reps.</span></p>
<h3><span class="s1">Dumbbell Straight-Arm Crunches</span></h3>
<p><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/3ksxlaN8sLsKFMri0P"><img src="https://i0.wp.com/media.giphy.com/media/3ksxlaN8sLsKFMri0P/giphy.gif?resize=480%2C270&#038;ssl=1" alt="Animated GIF - Find &amp; Share on GIPHY" width="480" height="270" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In this abs routine, you’re going to lay flat on your back with your knees bent. Hold the dumbbell out straight above you and continue to push the dumbbell straight towards the ceiling as you crunch.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">4 sets of 10-15 reps. </span></p>
<h3><span class="s1">Dumbbell Reverse Crunches</span></h3>
<p><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/B1SY1kmjV1yVAJcbpJ"><img src="https://i2.wp.com/media.giphy.com/media/B1SY1kmjV1yVAJcbpJ/giphy.gif?resize=480%2C270&#038;ssl=1" alt="Animated GIF - Find &amp; Share on GIPHY" width="480" height="270" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Lay flat on your back again for this one but this time, place a dumbbell between your feet with your knees completely bent and thighs pointing straight up. Hold on to the dumbbell with your feet and bring your legs up toward your chest making sure your lower back gets off the ground. Focus on using your abs to pull your legs up and not getting momentum from your knees or feet. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">4 sets of 10-15 reps.</span></p>
<h3><span class="s1">Rotating Mountain Climbers</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For this one, get into a regular push-up position. Now, similar to mountain climbers, you will be driving your knees upward but will also do a twist as you do so. So you drive your knees to your opposite elbow as you twist your core.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">4 sets of 10-15 reps each way.</span></p>
<h3><span class="s1">Dumbbell Woodchops</span></h3>
<p><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/uANrWMqcPO9s62VFoZ"><img src="https://i0.wp.com/media.giphy.com/media/uANrWMqcPO9s62VFoZ/giphy.gif?resize=480%2C270&#038;ssl=1" alt="Animated GIF - Find &amp; Share on GIPHY" width="480" height="270" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Stand with a single dumbbell held by both hands and start off by turning your shoulders completely to one side, keeping the dumbbell low. Rotate your shoulders to the opposite side as you raise the dumbbell up high above your head in the process. Focus on engaging your core with the twists.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">4 sets of 10-15 each way.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">These core exercises, </span>as well as other <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/workout-plans-weight-loss/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">fat burning workouts</a>,<span style="font-size: 1rem;">will h</span>elp you get six pack abs and lead a healthier, more active life.</p>

</div>
<p class="p2">But these deltoid exercises are completely pointless without knowing your body type first! Once you know your body type, you speed up results with everything that you do in the gym or the kitchen.<a href="https://vshred.com/sp/survey/survey-aka1" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> If you want to find out which body type you are, take our free body type quiz before you do anything else!</a></p>
<p class="p2">Building your shoulders to become sculpted like you wish starts with doing exercises for the right part of the shoulder.</p>
<p class="p1">There are actually 3 main areas when talking about the “shoulder muscle”.</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">Front Delts</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">These are responsible for helping to create that “3D” appearance from the front. Also, these help to create a nice separation between your shoulder and your chest muscle.</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">Side Delts</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">There are responsible for giving your shoulders a wider appearance due to them being out “outer” head. These are the king of making your shoulders look better!</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">Rear Delts</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">These are responsible for not only helping posture by pulling your shoulders back. But these are also great for giving an even appearance to your shoulder muscles from behind or the side.</p>
<p class="p1">But today, we are focusing on the side deltoid exercises because we are going for wider shoulders!</p>
<h2 class="p1">5 Deltoid Exercises For Wider Shoulders</h2>
<h3 class="p1">Dumbbell Lateral Raises</h3>
<p class="p1">These are the most common of the deltoid exercises, but for good reason! Here, you will start by grabbing a light weight set of dumbbells. From there, you will stand straight up, take your arms and open them out to the side. Focusing on lifting your elbows slightly higher than your hands, you will raise your arms until they are level with your shoulders. Then you will lower them back down to your side.</p>
<h3 class="p1">45 Degree Raises</h3>
<p class="p1">These are similar to the lateral raises. But instead of raising your arms out to the side, you are going to lift them out and forward at a 45 degree angle. This is going to allow you to use slightly heavier weights and target your outer head really well with that additional weight. Remember to lead with your elbows so you don’t accidentally cheat with another muscle group.</p>
<h3 class="p1">Leaning Cable Lateral Raises</h3>
<p class="p1">Again, similar to the dumbbell lateral raises because most deltoid exercises are going to have something to do with raising weight laterally. But you will put the cable pulley to the bottom, grab the bar and lean out to the side. You want to have your body at an angle to the pulley. From there, you will push your arm down and out away from you, rather than raising it straight up. By pushing it out and away from you, you will engage more deltoid, rather than traps. Once you have raised your arm to just below parallel to the ground, you will lower your arm back down to perpendicular to the ground. NOT ALL THE WAY! This will allow constant tension on the muscle.</p>
<h3 class="p1">Side Lying Lateral Raises</h3>
<p class="p1">With an opposite lean of the cable raises, you will be on an incline bench. From there, you will, again, drive your arm down and out as you raise the weight up to the side. Once you have your arm in-line with your shoulders, lower it back down to your side. But do not rest it on your body. Remember to maintain tension as much as possible throughout.</p>
<h3 class="p1">EZ Bar Upright Rows</h3>
<p class="p1">Lastly, we have another common choice for deltoid exercises, but for great reason again. Here you will want to start out by grabbing an EZ bar. Grab it by the outer handles or whatever is most comfortable for you. Then take your elbows, and at a slight angle forward, drive them out as you raise the weight up. Once your elbows are level with your shoulders, lower the weight back down to starting position.</p>
<p class="p1">So there are 5 great deltoid exercises for sculpting your shoulders fast! If you like these exercises, make sure you share this with a friend so they can learn about these too!</p>
<p class="p1">Also, let us know down below what your favorite deltoid exercises are!</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Getting bigger arms is not the easiest task. But if you’re looking to finally accomplish this seemingly massive goal, you need to be incorporating the best bicep workout fix! This simple adjustment will make all the difference!</p>
<div class="embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9 mb-5">

</div>
<div></div>
<p class="p1">Bigger arms is one of the most sought out goals when it comes to fitness. But actually getting your biceps to fill out your sleeves and get those veins sticking out is easier said than done.</p>
<h4 class="p1">If you’re ready to say goodbye to the struggles of small arm land and build serious bicep muscle, it’s time to put down the muscle magazines, <a href="https://vshred.com/sp/survey/survey-aka1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">learn your body type with this free body type quiz</a> and start doing the best bicep workout fix today!</h4>
<p class="p1">This workout fix is great for any kind of bicep exercise, such as dumbbells curls, cable curls, EZ bar curls, etc. But in this video, I will be using the face curl for my example.</p>
<p class="p1">The reason I am using the face curl is because the face curl is a great way to target the “peak” of the bicep. This is also known as the “short head” of the bicep muscle.</p>
<h2 class="p1">The Best Bicep Workout Mistake</h2>
<p class="p1">You see, the biggest mistake you can make when doing bicep exercises, is going too heavy. By going too heavy, you are preventing yourself from achieving full range of motion.</p>
<p class="p1">But this is not to say you’re not getting the full stretch of the muscle. That part is no problem. All you have to do is let the weight straighten your arm.</p>
<p class="p1">Instead, you are not able to get the “peak” contraction of the muscle because you can’t properly lift it all the way up.</p>
<h3 class="p1">The Best Bicep Workout Fix</h3>
<p class="p1">In order to correct years of doing this on accident, you can simply incorporate a bicep curl additive to achieve this “peak” contraction.</p>
<p class="p1">To do this, you will do, what I call, the “triple-pump bicep curl”. This is when you set up into bicep curl position and using a lighter weight you will curl the weight towards you.</p>
<p class="p1">Now instead of lowering the weight back down to the original starting position, you will go half-way down and curl back up. You will repeat this 2 more times and then lower it all the way down.</p>
<p class="p1">Therefore, you will have curled the weight all the way up, gotten the “peak” contraction four times, and fully extended the muscle by lowering the weight all the way back down.</p>
<h4 class="p1">The Conclusion</h4>
<p class="p1">If you are someone who has struggled with packing on bicep muscle, it very well could be because you’re not getting the full range of motion. So by incorporating the “triple-pump bicep curl” you will put extra emphasis on the “peak” contraction, allowing for more gains!</p>
<p class="p1">Try this out and be sure to share this with a friend who needs bigger arms!</p>
<p class="p1">Also, comment down below what your best bicep workout fix is! I’m excited to hear from you!</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Shoulder workout can be done by anybody. These exercises primarily help build and develop your shoulder muscles.</p>
<p>With the right amount of weight and number of reps, work your way to better delts with these five shoulder workouts. Read on to find out more!</p>
<h2>5 Shoulder Workouts To Get That Bulk You Deserve</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div id="warming" class="anchor"></div>
<h3>Warming Up</h3>
<p>Before performing the proper exercises, start with some warm-up stretches first. Stretch your shoulders out with an overhead press to hit all parts of your deltoids.</p>
<p>Then, follow this with side raises to prepare the middle part of your deltoids for a more intensive workout. Finally, work on stretching the anterior part of your shoulders with some front raises.</p>
<p>You can do 8 reps for each of these warm-up exercises.</p>
<div id="overhead" class="anchor"></div>
<h3><span style="color: #000080;">1. Overhead Press</span></h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2592" src="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/person-carrying-black-barbell-shoulder-workouts-px.jpg?resize=625%2C417&#038;ssl=1" alt="Overhead Press | Full Shoulder Workout Video | rep range" width="625" height="417" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/person-carrying-black-barbell-shoulder-workouts-px.jpg?w=625&amp;ssl=1 625w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/person-carrying-black-barbell-shoulder-workouts-px.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>As you start this exercise, make sure you are seated so that your <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/lower-ab-workout-that-only-takes-4-minutes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lower body</a> cannot contribute to the heavy lifting. Put on just the right amount of weight on the barbell for you to start with.</p>
<p>You may gradually increase the weight as you go along. The goal of this workout is to focus on hitting all parts of your deltoids.</p>
<p>Do 8 to 12 reps of overhead lifting for this one.</p>
<div id="front" class="anchor"></div>
<h3><span style="color: #000080;">2. Front Delt Rope Raises</span></h3>
<p>Stand with your back facing the weight stack machine with the rope going through the space between your legs. Pull the handle of the rope slowly up and release it down in a controlled manner.</p>
<p>This targets the anterior part of your deltoids. Do this in 10 reps or as many as you&#8217;d like.</p>
<div id="bent" class="anchor"></div>
<h3><span style="color: #000080;">3. Bent Over Rear Delt Dumbbell Raises</span></h3>
<p>Take a couple of dumbbells and sit on a bench, bent over, with your chest brought near your knees.</p>
<p>Lift those dumbbells sideways and slowly release. This counts as one rep.</p>
<p>Don’t swing the dumbbells too fast because it won’t help your posterior delts. Do this in as many reps as you like.</p>
<div id="rear" class="anchor"></div>
<h3><span style="color: #000080;">4. Rear Delt Rope Poles</span></h3>
<p><!-- instagram error: invalid instagram resource --></p>
<p>Position yourself by sitting on the floor in front of the weight stack machine. Place your feet on the pole for added control and maneuverability.</p>
<p>Pull the rope with your elbows towards your forehead. This exercise hits your rear delts and improves your traps.</p>
<div id="dumbbell" class="anchor"></div>
<h3><span style="color: #000080;">5. Dumbbell Raises</span></h3>
<p>The last exercise requires you to raise the dumbbells in a standing position. You need to raise them out to the side, but a little bit forward in as many reps as you can.</p>
<p>This hits the front and middle parts of your shoulders. You can perform this exercise again once you&#8217;re done with three sets with heavier weights.</p>
<p>For your second pass, you may use lighter weights and lift for as many times as you like.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">When you’re trying to build a strong, impressive looking back, you need to make sure you’re doing the best back exercises. Here are 10 for you to choose from for your next workout.</p>
<div class="embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9 mb-5">

</div>
<p class="p1">Remember, a single workout will only get you so far when trying to get in shape. You need to make sure you’re following an all around plan that matches your body type.. And then the results will come much faster! <a href="https://vshred.com/sp/survey/survey-aka1?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=post&amp;utm_campaign=v-shred&amp;utm_content=10-best-back-exercises-to-build-muscle&amp;utm_term=4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Click here to use our free body type quiz and learn exactly what to do to get in shape fast!</a></p>
<p class="p1">Building a back that you’re proud of can be difficult. But it becomes much easier when you’re doing exercises that will actually work it properly.</p>
<p class="p1">Here are 10 of the best back exercises for building muscle and strength!</p>
<h2 class="p1">The Best Back Exercises</h2>
<h3 class="p1">Rack Pulls</h3>
<p class="p1">These are one of the best exercises there are for building mass. Due to the short range of motion, you are able to go much heavier than you could on a regular deadlift. Also, this will focus more heavily on your back than your legs as well.</p>
<p class="p1">You want to set the bar up at about knee height. From there you will step up to the bar, with it touching your knees. Sit back on your heels, retract your scapula and drive your hips forward as you slide the bar across your thighs. From there, you can either drop the weight or return it back down slowly.</p>
<h3 class="p1">Barbell Rows</h3>
<p class="p1">This is one of the best compound back exercises there are due to it hitting so many different muscles, while focusing on your back the most. For these, you will pick the bar up, sit back on your heels, and bend over as you lower the bar in front of you away from your body. Then you will take your elbows and drive them back and out at a 45 degree angle and control it on the way back down.</p>
<h3 class="p1">Deadlifts</h3>
<p class="p1">Commonly referred to as the best compound exercise ever, these have an outstanding effect on the back muscles as well. Starting with the bar on the ground.. You will step up to the bar with your feet shoulder width and shins nearly touching the bar. Then you will grab the bar just outside of your shins and roll your shoulders back and press them down.. This will help pull the “slack” out of the bar. Then you will lift the bar up, sliding it<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>up your legs and once the bar is above your knees, drive your hips forward and stand straight up. Also, don’t forget to lock out your glutes at the top.</p>
<h3 class="p1">Weighted Pull-ups</h3>
<p class="p1">These are a great advanced variation to a regular pull-up. Starting with your hands outside of shoulder width, you will grab the pull up bar and hang. From there, without kicking, start to pull yourself up and act like you’re pulling your elbows in towards your side. Once at the top, return yourself back down in a controlled manner.</p>
<h3 class="p1">Weighted Chin-ups</h3>
<p class="p1">Very similar to weighted pull-ups but you will start with your palms facing you and hands much closer. From there you will pull yourself up, without kicking, and drive your elbows down and back until your chin is at the bar. Then return yourself back down in a controlled manner as well.</p>
<h3 class="p1">Straight Arm Pushdowns</h3>
<p class="p1">A great exercise for the “sweep” of the lats. You will use a cable attachment of your choice and put it to the top. From there you will grab it and feel a stretch in your lats at the top. Then, with a soft bend in your elbows, drive your arms down and back until the attachment is near your belly button. Then return back to the top and the stretch in your lats again.</p>
<h3 class="p1">Dumbbell Rows</h3>
<p class="p1">One of the best dumbbell back exercises. You will take a dumbbell in one hand with the other hand supporting your body. Then you will, first, bring the dumbbell backward and then row the weight up. This will help you feel it in your lat more. Then return back down the same way. Don’t forget to do both arms.</p>
<h3 class="p1">Cable Rows</h3>
<p class="p1">These are a staple in most back workouts and for good reason. For these, you can use any attachment you like. You just want to get your body in a strong position with your knees slightly bent and your back slightly leaning back. Then you will, again, drive your arms down and back towards your belly button. Then return the same way. Try to feel a stretch at the bottom of the exercise as well.</p>
<h3 class="p1">Lat Pulldowns</h3>
<p class="p1">These are a great exercise no matter your goal. You will get in a lat pulldown machine and grab the bar just outside of shoulder width. From there, you will take your elbows and drive them down and into your sides, feeling a squeeze on your lats. Then control it on the way back up and feel the stretch at the top.</p>
<h3 class="p1">Close Grip Lat Pulldowns</h3>
<p class="p1">Very similar to regular lat pulldowns but you will use an attachment that allows for a close grip. From there, you want to aim to feel a stretch at the top. Then drive your elbows down in front of you and squeeze them back. And return the weight back in a controlled manner.</p>
<p class="p1">You can pick from these exercises the next time you’re going to do a back workout. Aim for 4 of these for 4 sets each and you will have a great back workout!</p>
<p class="p1">If you like these exercises, don’t forget to share it on your socials and leave any comments you have down below!</p>

<p><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='1170' height='659' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/4YVT_SveWo4?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></p>
<p class="p1">But in order to build lean muscle, you need to know what body type you are. <a href="https://vshred.com/sp/survey/survey-aka1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Take this free body type quiz that tells you exactly what to do to get in shape fast!</a></p>
<p class="p1">Truth is, there are tons of upper body workouts scattering the internet. So how are you supposed to know which ones will actually work?</p>
<p class="p1">Whether an upper body workout is effective or not will come down to three things:</p>
<ol>
<li class="p1">Does it hit all the different muscle groups in your upper body?</li>
<li class="p1">Do you have proper form?</li>
<li class="p1">Is it an easy workout to do?</li>
</ol>
<p class="p1">Meaning, you need to hit your back, chest, shoulders, biceps and triceps all in one. You need to do all the exercises correctly. And you need to be able to do the workout without spending hours and hours in the gym.</p>
<p class="p1">That’s why this is better than the other upper body workouts that you’ve tried. It does all three and more!</p>
<p class="p1">This upper body workout will be three supersets (two exercises performed back to back), targeting all the different muscles groups. And it will only consist of resistance band exercises. Which makes it possible to do at home or even while traveling!</p>
<h2 class="p1">The Upper Body Workouts Layout</h2>
<ul>
<li class="p1">3 supersets</li>
<li class="p1">4 sets</li>
<li class="p1">10-12 reps per set</li>
<li class="p1">1 minute of rest between each set</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="p1">The Exercises:</h3>
<h4 class="p1">Low Banded Row Superset &amp; Banded Bicep Curls</h4>
<p class="p1">Start off by sitting on the ground with your feet straight out in front of you. From there, you will hook the band in the arch of your foot. Then grab the band near your feet and sit back into a 90 degree position with your arms straight out in front of you. You will then focus on driving your elbows back in-line with your belly button and return back to starting position. Repeat for 10-12 reps and go straight into your curls.</p>
<p class="p1">After that, you will get up and stand on the band. Grabbing the handles you will place your feet width depending on how difficult you want the curl to be. Then, keeping your elbows in the same position throughout, curl the weight all the weight up, and return back down slowly. Repeat for 10-12 reps and then rest for a minute. Then do 3 more sets.</p>
<h4 class="p1">Banded Pushup Superset &amp; Overhead Tricep Extensions</h4>
<p class="p1">Here, you will wrap the band around your back and grab it wherever is best fit for your capabilities. After picking your arm width, you will get into push-up position with your hands pressing down on top of the bands. Keeping the band wrapped around your lower shoulders, go down and do a regular pushup. Keep your shoulders rolled back and focus on driving your elbows together to engage your chest. Repeat for 10-12 reps and go straight into tricep extensions.</p>
<p class="p1">For the tricep extensions, you will sit on the band and lift it up over your head. Grab it wherever is best fit for your capabilities and elevate your elbows. From there, keeping your elbows in the same spot, drive your hands up, squeezing your triceps. Once your arms are straight, lower your hands until you are just past a 90 degree angle and go into the next rep. Repeat for 10-12 reps and rest for a minute. Then do 3 more sets and move into the final superset.</p>
<h4 class="p1">Shoulder Press Superset &amp; Lateral Raises</h4>
<p class="p1">For this exercise, you will start standing with the band under your feet. You will want to keep your feet together so that the exercise is not too difficult to perform properly. From there, you want to slightly bring your elbows forward, then push the handles up and together at the top. Then lower your arms until your elbows are just past 90 degrees and go into your next rep. Repeat for 10-12 reps and go straight into lateral raises.</p>
<p class="p1">For this exercise you will continue to stand on the resistance band. But instead of pressing the handles up, we are going to start with our arms down by our side and press the handles outward. By focusing on pressing outward, rather than raising up, you will engage less of your trap muscle to help with better isolation of the delt. Raise until your hands are shoulders level and return your arms back down to your side. Repeat for 10-12 reps, do 3 more sets and you’re done with the workout!</p>

<p class="p1">But matter how many exercises you do, you will not build muscle or get in shape without following a plan for your body type. <a href="https://vshred.com/sp/survey/survey-aka1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Click here to take our free body type quiz and learn exactly what will work fastest for your body!</a></p>
<p class="p1">Getting bigger, stronger and more defined arms is something that most people want. But what you may not realize is that your triceps make up around 70% of your upper arms.</p>
<p class="p1">That is why it is so crucial to pick the best tricep exercises to put on the most muscle and strength possible!</p>
<p class="p1">Remember, if you’re looking to build strength, you’ll want to stay in the 4-8 rep range. But for building actual muscle, you’ll want to stay in the 8-15 rep range.</p>
<p class="p1">So here are 9 of my favorite exercises to target your triceps and get you the results you’re looking for! DO NOT do all of these. Instead pick 3-4 and do 3-4 sets of each.</p>
<h2 class="p1">The Best Tricep Exercises</h2>
<ul>
<li class="p1"><strong>Close Grip Bench (Barbell or Dumbbell)</strong></li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">This is a great compound movement to start your workouts with. The main things to remember are to keep your hands just inside of shoulder width to avoid wrist pain. And keep your elbows tucked in as you lower the weight so engage your triceps as much as possible.</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1"><strong>Dips</strong></li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">Another great compound movement that will target all the heads of your triceps. Things to remember here are to keep your body as straight up and down as possible.. And be careful not to go too far down. I like to go just past 90 degrees to avoid elbow pain.</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1"><strong>EZ Bar Incline Skullcrushers</strong></li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">One of the best tricep exercises ever, with a slight twist on the set-up. Laying on an incline bench, you will target your tricep from a slightly different angle than a flat bench. Things to remember here are to bring your arms back so they are not straight up and down. This avoids you from cheating a rest at the top of the exercise. Also, remember to keep your elbows squeezed in as much as possible to target your triceps without joint pain.</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1"><strong>Flat Dumbbell Skullcrushers</strong></li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">Just like the incline skull crushers, but we are going to use a flat bench and dumbbells instead. Dumbbells allow for a free range of motion so that you target each arm the same amount and can get a fuller range of motion. Things to remember are just like the incline skullcrushers.. You want to keep your arms back so that you avoid them from being straight up and down at the top. Also to keep your elbows in the same position throughout the whole exercise.</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1"><strong>Tricep Cable Extensions</strong></li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">A very common exercise that you can use a number of handles for. Just make sure you’re using proper form by stepping about two feet away from the cable. This will allow optimal tricep tension so that you’re not nearly resting at the bottom. Also, you should avoid your elbows from bending much more than 90 degrees. Bringing the handle up too high can results in loss of tricep tension and/or elbow pain.</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1"><strong>Overhead Cable Extensions</strong></li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">These are a great variation to cable extensions that will target mostly the long head of the tricep which creates the “horseshoe”. Just want to make sure you’re keeping your elbows raise up so that they are nearly inline with your eyes.. Also, avoid allowing your elbows to flare.. and do not bring the handles back too far to avoid elbow pain as much as possible.</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1"><strong>Kickbacks</strong></li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">These are a great exercise that are commonly messed up. First thing is to make sure you’re using a weight you can handle. Being able to handle it, means lifting your elbow up as high as you can behind you and keeping it up that high the whole time. Also, never allowing your elbow to go past 90 degrees to avoid creating momentum to kick the weight back.</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1"><strong>Overhead Dumbbell Extensions</strong></li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">These are one of the best tricep exercises for packing on muscle mass due to being able to handle heavier weights. Just want to make sure you’re keeping your elbows together as much as possible. Also, make sure you’re squeezing at the top without uncontrollably locking out your elbows.</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1"><strong>Cross Body Dumbbell Extensions</strong></li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">Last but not least, we have a great exercise that is amazing at really isolating your triceps. Laying back on a bench, you will stick your arm out in front of you and bend your elbow as you bring the weight across your body. Make sure you’re slightly bringing your whole arm across your body so that you keep tension on the triceps the whole time. Also, make sure you keep your elbows locked in place throughout the entire movement.</p>
<p class="p1">As mentioned before, make sure you do not do all these exercises for your next tricep workout. Instead, pick 3 or 4 of them and do 3 or 4 sets of each.</p>
<p class="p1">If you liked these exercises, make sure you share them and leave any comments you have below!</p>
