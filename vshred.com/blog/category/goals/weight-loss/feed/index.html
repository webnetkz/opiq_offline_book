That is a scary number!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Good thing you found this article because </span><b><i>we aren’t going to let YOU be “most” people! </i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lower temps do not have to equal larger waistlines! You just have to have a plan! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this short read we will &#8230;</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Explain why winter weight gain happens. Knowing why is important if you want to prevent it and the reason is probably not what you think. In fact, it is partially not even your fault!</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tell you why fall/winter is actually the BEST time to start a diet and training plan.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Give you 7 easy pro tips that will help guide you through the next few months. </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You may believe winter weight gain happens because of the holidays. Those extra home cooked meals and holiday parties are certainly a factor. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But </span><b><i>there is a DAILY issue you need to be prepared to fight </i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">if you want to avoid packing on winter pounds.</span></p>
<p><b>WHY YOU REALLY PACK ON POUNDS AFTER LABOR DAY</b></p>
<p><img class="size-large wp-image-7471" src="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_130930953.jpeg?resize=1024%2C512&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="512" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_130930953.jpeg?resize=1024%2C512&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_130930953.jpeg?resize=300%2C150&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_130930953.jpeg?resize=768%2C384&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_130930953.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_130930953.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the spring and summer months, you are given what we call a</span><b> fitness freebie. </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You get a </span><b><i>seasonal motivation boost</i></b> <span style="font-weight: 400;">that doesn’t happen when temperatures start to drop, and you begin to pull out the chunky sweaters and comfy leggings. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not only is the sun shining (which makes you happier because of Vitamin D), you are wearing LESS clothing in the summer months. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I don’t know about you, but knowing I’m going to be exposing more skin makes walking in the gym a little easier. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Covering up in layers, no doubt leads to the temptation to slack on body goals! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Knowing your arms, legs, and abs will be less exposed can easily be an excuse to slack. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, being layered up often means you don’t SEE the extra pounds, so they are easier to ignore.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But there is more to it than being bundled up….</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-7477" src="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_236518834.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_236518834.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_236518834.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_236518834.jpeg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_236518834.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_236518834.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span>The #1 reason you slack on health and fitness goals in colder months ISN’T EVEN YOUR FAULT!!</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, you have a part to play in all of this, but</span><b><i> there is actually a scientific reason why you have less desire to train and eat healthy when the sunshine of summer fades.</i></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We will explain why a little further down. But ya know what really stinks? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The scientific reason why we all experience these motivation slumps in the winter only adds to an even bigger issue with motivation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span>It doesn’t matter what season it is motivation ALWAYS comes and goes!</p>
<p>Spring, Summer, Fall, or Winter &#8211; you can NEVER rely on it!</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, what can you do when lack of sunshine and warm temps leave you even more tempted to hit snooze and reach for comfort foods? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You certainly don’t throw your hands up in the air and wait until January to make a resolution to crash diet to get your body ready for spring. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Believe it or not, RIGHT NOW is actually the IDEAL time to get started! </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you </span><b><i>START NOW, </i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">you will develop discipline and a routine heading into the holidays. This will put you in a great place mentally and physically to relax and “indulge” a little more at all those holiday gatherings! </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><b><i>Look at it this way ..<br />
</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Would you rather head into the holiday season already making progress toward your goals and be in a great spot <em>(where it would be okay even if you did gain an extra pound or two?)</em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Or would you rather put it off and only add more fat on top of what you want to lose?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The answer is clear— the solution to getting the motivation needed to make it happen, not so much.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But don’t worry! We’ve got ya covered</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (no pun intended)</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with a few easy motivation hacks!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><b>7 TIPS TO STAY MOTIVATED AS SEASONS CHANGE</b></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><b><br />
</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the number one questions we always get is … “<em>I am just not motivated. How can I motivate myself to train and eat better?”</em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As we mentioned earlier, it doesn&#8217;t matter what season it is, </span><b><i>you can’t always rely on motivation. </i></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you have it, great! You should certainly take advantage of it! But you have to know that it is totally normal to not have much of it. Even professional athletes lack motivation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You have to develop other daily habits that create discipline if you want to succeed long term!</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are a few of our pro tips that we use with our clients, specifically when temperatures drop, and motivation seems to be at its lowest! </span></p>
<p><b>TIP #1: Switch To An At Home Training Program</b></p>
<p><img class="size-large wp-image-7448" src="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_185038762.jpeg?resize=1024%2C647&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="647" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_185038762.jpeg?resize=1024%2C647&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_185038762.jpeg?resize=300%2C189&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_185038762.jpeg?resize=768%2C485&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_185038762.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_185038762.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you know that getting out of bed and stepping into the winter elements is going to be an excuse trigger, make a plan to train at home during cooler months! Some of the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">most effective and challenging workouts </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">only require your body weight and </span><b><i>maybe</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a set of dumbbells or some resistance bands.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A good fat-blasting, muscle-building sweat session can 100% be achieved from the comfort of your home!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adjustable dumbbells, ankle weights, resistance bands, a jump rope, etc., are all things that are inexpensive and can easily be stored in a closet or under your bed and pulled out anytime you don’t feel like leaving the house.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But if you have </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">the right training program</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><b><i>you don’t need any of that. </i></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our favorite </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">at-home bodyweight-only program</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is called</span><b> MOVE. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was designed to help you achieve your fitness goals without a single piece of equipment, and each workout is under 20 minutes! </span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Learn more about MOVE by watching the video below!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you need </span><b>a little extra “nudge”</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to get up and get moving, another </span><b>pro-tip we use</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is keeping some </span><a href="https://sculptnation.com/products/pre-workout" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><b>PRE WORKOUT </b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">on your bedside table. Have it already blended up and chug it as soon as your alarm goes off!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By the time you have brushed your teeth and put on your workout clothes, you will have a nice little jolt of energy and</span><b><i> tons of motivation</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to get going before you have a chance to come up with an excuse! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the bottom of this article, we will tell you about a big end of summer sale happening so that you can stock up on our </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">favorite </span><a href="https://sculptnation.com/products/pre-workout" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><b>PRE WORKOUT</b></a><strong> for 40% off when you use code: LABORDAY40 at checkout! </strong></p>
<p><b>TIP #2: Make Your Workouts Seasonal</b></p>
<p><img class="size-large wp-image-7452" src="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_65703942.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_65703942.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_65703942.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_65703942.jpeg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_65703942.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_65703942.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Embrace the change of seasons and take advantage of activities that you can only do in fall or winter! </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Go on a fall hike and view all the gorgeous foliage.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Try rock climbing.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Walk around a corn maze or pumpkin patch with your family. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you live in a snowy climate, go skiing, sledding, build snowmen with your kids, etc.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Go ice skating.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lace-up your sneakers, go for a walk or run at night, and admire all the Christmas lights and decorations.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are some things you can only do and see during specific times of the year. So instead of missing sunshine and water sports, focus on all the positive things that only come about with cooler temps!</span></p>
<p><b>TIP #3: Try Something Totally New</b></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-7454" src="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_361152601.jpeg?resize=1024%2C514&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="514" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_361152601.jpeg?resize=1024%2C514&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_361152601.jpeg?resize=300%2C151&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_361152601.jpeg?resize=768%2C386&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_361152601.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_361152601.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sometimes a change of routine is all you need to boost motivation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you have been doing all your gym lifts alone, recruit a gym buddy! Try switching up your cardio by skipping your solo runs and joining a group fitness class instead. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another option is to </span><b><i>allow yourself to slow down!</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> If you have been crushing it all spring and summer with intense training and hardcore workouts, </span><b><i>it may actually be time to take it down a notch. </i></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Going full force 365 can cause your stress hormone cortisol to increase. This can lead to a host of drawbacks, including weight gain, muscle loss, poor moods, fatigue, and occasional issues sleeping! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We aren’t saying you should become lazy! But if you have been crushing it 24/7 all spring and summer, your body (and mind) may need to slow down.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Use the next few months to embrace a slower routine. </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Commit to daily yoga.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Focus on becoming more flexible.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Switch to low or moderate-intensity cardio, instead of HIIT.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Try out some bodyweight workouts instead of heavy lifting.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Giving your body a couple of months to recover might even make you more responsive when you decide to kick things up again come spring/summer!</span></p>
<p><b>TIP #4: Stay Accountable</b></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-7457" src="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_266584820.jpeg?resize=1024%2C768&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="768" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_266584820.jpeg?resize=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_266584820.jpeg?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_266584820.jpeg?resize=768%2C576&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_266584820.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_266584820.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><b><br />
</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">The best way to stick to a plan is to have someone that you report back to. This could be a friend, family member, a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">social media community</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, or even a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">coach. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Including someone else, or even just telling someone else about your health and fitness goals and asking them to check in with you to make sure you are sticking to the plan, is a great way to keep the promises you make to yourself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you prefer to fly solo, it helps to create visuals. Make a vision board, create a daily checklist you can mark off after each workout, or keep an accomplishment journal.</span></p>
<p><b>TIP #5: Set A Spring Goal</b></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-7458" src="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_47332240.jpeg?resize=1024%2C680&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="680" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_47332240.jpeg?resize=1024%2C680&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_47332240.jpeg?resize=300%2C199&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_47332240.jpeg?resize=768%2C510&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_47332240.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_47332240.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">March may seem like a long time away, but it will be back before you know it, and 6 months is a long time to make significant changes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Setting a goal is a great way to encourage yourself to push past discomforts and temptation, but there is a science to goal setting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The key to creating goals that stick .. </span><b><i>be REALISTIC and SPECIFIC!</i></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s start with </span><b><i>reality. </i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">You should always focus on one goal at a time and make sure you are being honest with yourself if that goal is really attainable.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you know that your schedule will never allow you to work out 6 days a week, why would you choose a program that requires you to do that?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you know it’s not healthy to attempt to lose 10 pounds a week, why would you aim that high?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you love carbs, why would you go on a KETO diet? </span></p>
<p><b><i>Doing these things will essentially set yourself up for failure.</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Set attainable goals that fit YOUR lifestyle. You can always bump things up if your schedule allows, or you notice you aren’t pushing yourself hard enough. Just keep in mind that being realistic isn’t the same as not believing in yourself or making excuses. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moving on to being </span><b><i>specific.</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The more specific you are about your goals, the more likely you will be to reach them. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It may seem like it’s good enough to say things like .. I want to look good, lose weight, or get ripped! </span><b><i>But you have to dig deeper than that!! </i></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wanting to “lose weight,” for example, is an excellent place to start. But ask yourself what that means to you?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you expand on that and say &#8212; “I want to lose 10 pounds of fat. I will do this by not eating any sweets and doing the V Shred </span><a href="https://vshred.com/sp/move/soc-all/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><b>MOVE </b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">program for 30 consecutive days. I am doing this because I want to have better self-esteem and a head start on bikini season.” &#8212; that makes your goal more specific.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The more specific (and attainable) your goals are, the more likely you will be to not give up!</span></p>
<p><b>TIP #6: Reward Yourself</b></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-7459" src="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/vin_sant_32048508_366936073798151_433609263865135104_n.jpg?resize=882%2C1024&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="882" height="1024" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/vin_sant_32048508_366936073798151_433609263865135104_n.jpg?resize=882%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 882w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/vin_sant_32048508_366936073798151_433609263865135104_n.jpg?resize=258%2C300&amp;ssl=1 258w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/vin_sant_32048508_366936073798151_433609263865135104_n.jpg?resize=768%2C892&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/vin_sant_32048508_366936073798151_433609263865135104_n.jpg?w=1080&amp;ssl=1 1080w" sizes="(max-width: 882px) 100vw, 882px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you have checked a “mini goal” off your list, treat yourself. Knowing that you have a reward coming to celebrate your efforts will make you want to achieve it even more. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It may be tempting to make your reward one of your favorite “forbidden foods” but we never suggest that you reward yourself this way.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You aren’t a dog. You should never reward “good behavior” with food. Having this mentality can create a really unhealthy relationship with food.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You need to eat healthy MOST of the time, control your portions, and see food as fuel. But if you are craving something that isn’t quite as healthy as your grilled chicken and rice, never feel like you need to lose 20 pounds to “deserve” a bite of cake, or nice dinner out with your family. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instead of rewarding yourself with food, buy yourself something you have been wanting. Maybe some new workout clothes, a massage, or an extra $20 bucks in your vacation fund! </span></p>

<p><b>TIP #7: Make Mental Health Top Priority</b></p>
<p><img class="size-large wp-image-7460" src="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_255894146.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_255894146.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_255894146.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_255894146.jpeg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_255894146.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_255894146.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Earlier, we mentioned that cold weather motivation dips may not be your fault.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’m sure you have heard of winter blues. Well, it’s a real thing. Less natural light can cause dips in serotonin, the neurotransmitter that regulates mood.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The dark and dreary days of winter can also cause your body to produce more of the sleep hormone melatonin. This shift can disrupt your body and impact your sleep patterns and overall mood.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are a few ways that you can focus on improving your mental health.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Invest in a light therapy box that simulates natural daylight.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Make sure you are supplementing with or eating plenty of foods with Vitamin D.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Start journaling. There is a lot of scientific evidence that supports putting your thoughts on paper provides a long list of benefits, including stress management, self-confidence, and goal setting. </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Suppose you still find yourself struggling with negative seasonal motivation shifts. In that case, you may need to experiment with taking</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> naturally sourced herbs</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to help support brain health and a positive mood.</span></p>
<p><b><i>Here are a few with some great scientific backing to help boost mood.</i></b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>EnXtra: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">A natural caffeine-free patent-pending botanical ingredient that has been shown to help increase dopamine levels.**It is also one of the first and only natural caffeine-free patent-pending botanical ingredients shown to boost mental alertness &amp; acuity for hours or ending in a huge caffeine energy crash.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Piper Nigrum Fruit Extract:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> A very specific type of black pepper that has been shown to help increase both serotonin and dopamine.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>L-Theanine:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> A powerful amino acid that is believed to help reduce occasional anxiety brought on by stressful situations.</span></li>
</ul>

<p><b><i>BOTTOM LINE IF YOU WANT TO STAY MOTIVATED YEAR ROUND</i></b><b><i><br />
</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you put away the shorts and swimsuits and shift out of bikini season, it’s common for motivation to “fall back” with the clocks. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The seasons have to change (unless you live near the equator) &#8211; so you have to figure out ways to</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">not let your fitness goals go into hibernation mode!</span><b><i> </i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pumpkin spice lattes are only here for a limited time, but getting into shape isn’t seasonal! </span><i>It&#8217;s a year-round commitment!!</i><i> </i></p>

<p>It is that time of year!! 4th of July is upon us!!</p>
<p>Burgers on the grill … fireworks in the sky … and for many .. an excuse to skip the gym and eat thousands of calories .. in one sitting!</p>
<p>It can be tempting to throw your diet and training mindset out the window when holidays come around. But you must treat holidays just like you would any other day.</p>
<p>Have fun .. enjoy the time with family … and even enjoy all the food .. but keep your goals in mind. One of the best things you can do .. is still get in a solid workout!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>We’ve got the perfect 4th of July PRE PARTY PUMP!</strong></em></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-7322" src="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_8006.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_8006.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_8006.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_8006.jpeg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_8006.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>The workout we&#8217;re giving you below will not only burn a ton of calories .. the endorphins released from this short HIIT workout will boost your mood .. which will help you keep your healthy food habits in mind when it’s time to fire up the grill!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>We will never tell you that you need to “earn” your calories .. that is not the kind of relationship with food we promote here at V Shred &amp; Sculpt Nation.</strong></em></p>
<p>Food should never be seen as “the enemy” or “a reward” .. and exercise should never be viewed as punishment.</p>
<p>Diet culture makes us feel bad about having a nice dinner with friends, and it makes us fall into the mind trap that holidays will make us gain weight.</p>
<p><em><strong>What happens next?</strong></em></p>
<p><img class="size-large wp-image-7158" src="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_215638387.jpeg?resize=1024%2C684&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="684" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_215638387.jpeg?resize=1024%2C684&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_215638387.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_215638387.jpeg?resize=768%2C513&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_215638387.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_215638387.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>We feel guilt .. and view exercise as “punishment” we “have” to get up and do the next day .. or as justification that if we burn a ton of calories pre-feast .. it’s okay to eat that extra serving of ice cream or calorie-filled cocktail.</p>
<p>Once you get this mentality, you will begin an endless (and very unhealthy) relationship with food. You will start to believe you ALWAYS have to earn food .. and will only feel okay about enjoying yourself .. if you have exercised.</p>
<p>Instead, look at your patriotic pump as a FREEDOM that you are blessed to have! You have an able body that GETS to move!!!</p>
<p>And view all that 4th of July food as FUEL! Getting in a workout before a big meal is a great way to rev up your metabolism and prepare your body to USE (instead of store) any extra calories you may consume!</p>
<p>Don’t fall into this food guilt trap<em>..</em>But also don’t go to the totally opposite end of the spectrum and make the holidays an excuse to be lazy and throw all your food mindfulness out the window! Use the short 15-minute workout  below and then ENJOY your day!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>Alright .. let’s get our PATRIOTIC PUMP ON!!</strong></em></p>
<p>Here is a quick fat blasting FOLLOW-ALONG cardio workout that won’t interfere with your day full of fun with friends and family!</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='1170' height='659' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/HzkBonK4kPQ?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The video above is a FOLLOW ALONG! Just press play and get to work! This fat-blasting workout consists of only 5 exercises. You will do each exercise for 40 seconds and take a quick 20-second break before moving on to the next exercise.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Explosive Squat with Calf Raises &#8211; 40 Seconds</strong><br />
<strong>Speed Skaters &#8211; 40 Seconds</strong><br />
<strong>High Knees &#8211; 40 Seconds</strong><br />
<strong>Alternating Toe Taps &#8211; 40 Seconds</strong><br />
<strong>Bicycles &#8211; 40 Seconds</strong></p>
<p>It only takes 15 minutes and can be done from home with NO EQUIPMENT! You don’t even need a mat or a timer! Since it’s a follow-along .. we’ve got everything taken care of for you!</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>The Future Of Fat Loss Revealed (It sounds too good to be true)</strong></em></p>
<p><img class="size-large wp-image-7388" src="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_183074918.jpeg?resize=1024%2C567&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="567" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_183074918.jpeg?resize=1024%2C567&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_183074918.jpeg?resize=300%2C166&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_183074918.jpeg?resize=768%2C425&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_183074918.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_183074918.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>If there was a magic pill that allowed you to not exercise, eat what you want, and never gain an ounce of fat… everyone would be walking around with a six-pack and a slice of pizza.</p>
<p>There is no such thing.</p>
<p>But if some of the top researchers in the world are correct .. <em><strong>there may be a BIOLOGICAL “LOOPHOLE”</strong></em> … that helps support the speed of the metabolism (which dictates how much fat you can lose.)</p>
<p>It’s so effective… <em><strong>they are calling it “THE FUTURE OF FAT LOSS”!!</strong></em></p>
<p>This IS going to sound too good to be true.<br />
This IS going to sound like a bunch of hype.</p>
<p>Because this loophole is NOT a diet plan, a workout video, or anything else you may think of when it comes to burning fat.</p>
<p>We had a hard time believing it too.</p>
<p>But the science on this one is pretty clear.<br />
<em><strong>This discovery is all about how your body, and your fat cells, communicate.</strong></em></p>
<p>Once you change this communication process, it seems that it is possible to <em><strong>force your body to support burning it’s deepest fat stores</strong></em>. You know, the ones that seem immune to hardcore workouts and ultra-strict diets.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>It can all happen because of something called … Simultaneous Fat Release.</strong></em></p>

<p>How do you promote the activation of your body’s “simultaneous fat release” capabilities?<br />
We are about to tell you!!</p>
<p>It’s crazy!! But once you know how to change the conversation that’s happening between your fat cells… you can finally help alter the way your body burns fat ..rapidly!</p>
<p><em><strong>For real! This hack only takes about 30 seconds to add to your day!!</strong></em></p>
<p>Before we tell you what scientists say the solution is .. let’s go back to the first discovery researchers made .. so that we can better understand why all this happens to begin with.</p>
<p><strong>FAT CELL SIGNALING</strong><br />
Researchers found that our fat cells talk to each other. It’s called Fat Cell Signaling.</p>
<p>Fat cells are not merely big blobs that sit in silence. They are rather chatty and not only talk to each other, but to other cells in your body.</p>
<p>Right now, as you read this, your fat cells are deciding whether or not they are going to put your body into fat-burning mode or fat-storing mode.</p>
<p>If you <span style="text-decoration: underline;">NEVER</span> struggle with your weight… congrats! That means your fat cells are probably having a nice chat.</p>
<p>However, if you feel like you struggle to lose weight, those same 10 pounds keep coming back, most diets fail, or you can’t seem to get rid of “stubborn” areas of fat .. your fat cells are most likely having a conversation you don’t want them to have.</p>
<p>Most of us fall into that second category because our bodies were designed to store fat.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>Chances are the conversation your cells are having over-and-over again ..</strong></em><br />
<em><strong>is to HOLD ON to fat .. not burn it.</strong></em></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-7130" src="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_209544099.jpeg?resize=1170%2C780&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1170" height="780" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_209544099.jpeg?w=5910&amp;ssl=1 5910w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_209544099.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_209544099.jpeg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_209544099.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_209544099.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_209544099.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1170px) 100vw, 1170px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>This means you can do all the cardio in the world and eat an overly restrictive diet but still be holding on to a stubborn layer of fat!</p>
<p>Of course, how much body fat you have will depend on lots of factors (diet, exercise, stress, sleep, genetics, etc.) But your fat cells ultimately make this decision through that constant communication (fat cell signaling).</p>
<p>This new research also explains why some of the most popular American diets don’t work long term. Sorry “keto” and “low-fat” .. science says your restrictive diets DO NOT have the ability to change the way your fat cells communicate.</p>
<p>However, scientists discovered a receptor in your body that CAN help alter this communication process. Once “activated”, it can help complement any “diet” and exercise program you choose.<br />
It’s called the TRPV1 Receptor.</p>
<p><strong>WHAT IS THE TRPV1 RECEPTOR</strong><br />
A professor of neurosurgery, biological chemistry, and neuroscience at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine was the first to discover this receptor.</p>
<p>You have TRPV1 Receptors throughout your entire body. Their main job is to regulate your body’s temperature and energy usage. It kicks in when your body temperature increases.</p>
<p>For example, when you are doing cardio or working out. TRPV1 senses this temperature spike and tells your fat cells to start burning their contents for energy.</p>
<p><strong>WHAT HAPPENS WHEN TRPV1 RECEPTORS ARE ACTIVATED (“Simultaneous Fat Release”)</strong><br />
Now it’s time to tell you about that “loophole” we mentioned.</p>
<p>Scientists discovered that when these receptors are activated, they help tell your fat cells to start communicating differently. They tell them to burn themselves for energy, instead of holding on and storing in places like your stomach and thighs.</p>
<p>This is important….<br />
It means that TRPV1 can actually alter the conversation that’s happening between your fat cells. In fact, they found <em><strong>when you activate TRPV1 Receptors, you can support fat burning virtually EVERYWHERE .</strong></em></p>
<p>The ability to burn fat EVERYWHERE all at once is called “Simultaneous Fat Release.”</p>
<p>This process can force your body to support burning the fat you already have (even your deepest fat stores)..</p>
<p><em><strong>Simultaneous Fat Release can fundamentally transform your body’s relationship with fat…</strong></em> because once you activate your body’s “simultaneous fat release” capabilities.. you can stay in fat-burning support mode virtually all day …burning unhealthy fat build-up EVERYWHERE in your body.</p>
<p><strong>HOW TO ACTIVATE TRPV1 RECEPTORS (simultaneous fat release)</strong></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-7131" src="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_342916350.jpeg?resize=1170%2C771&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1170" height="771" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_342916350.jpeg?w=4802&amp;ssl=1 4802w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_342916350.jpeg?resize=300%2C198&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_342916350.jpeg?resize=768%2C506&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_342916350.jpeg?resize=1024%2C675&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_342916350.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_342916350.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1170px) 100vw, 1170px" data-recalc-dims="1" /><br />
As mentioned, one way to activate the TRPV1 Receptors is through super-intense workouts.<br />
But scientists have found that we can also activate our TRV1 Receptors another way.</p>
<p>They discovered that these receptors can also be activated by eating a common spice found in red chili peppers. It’s called Capsaicin.</p>
<p>Over the years, NUMEROUS studies have been done on the effectiveness of Capsaicin.</p>
<p><em><strong>Here are the findings of only A FEW ….</strong></em></p>
<ul>
<li>“Capsaicin was found to enhance energy expenditure and fat burning in humans, particularly those with a high Body Mass Index (BMI.)”</li>
<li>“Participants in the Capsaicin group saw a significant decrease in stomach fat when used as part of a weight management program.”</li>
<li>“The Capsaicin group lost nearly double the weight of the placebo group.”</li>
<li>“The Capsaicin group increased their body’s fat-burning potential by up to 46.4% when used daily for 8 weeks, while the placebo group saw no improvement at all.”</li>
<li>“Capsaicin activates TRPV1 Receptors and significantly increases metabolism and fat burning potential.”</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>OF COURSE, it’s not as easy as eating some red chili peppers!!</strong></em></p>
<p>All of the studies mentioned used a Capsaicin supplement. That is because the amount of chili peppers needed to activate your TRPV1 receptors is very high. It would make you physically sick if you attempted to EAT that many chili peppers (don&#8217;t do that.)</p>
<p>With a supplement, you can safely consume Capsaicin at a much higher quantity.</p>
<p>BEFORE YOU EXIT THIS ARTICLE and attempt to “google” Capsaicin ..<em><strong> there is something very important you need to know about this spice.</strong></em></p>
<p>The supplement form of Capsaicin isn’t hard to find. However, it can vary dramatically both in quality and effectiveness.</p>
<p>You have to ensure that the Capsaicin you choose is time-released and has a special coating.</p>
<p>For that reason, there’s only one form of Capsaicin that we stand behind. <em><strong>This specific formula of Capsaicin has already helped over 1.2 Million people (and counting) finally lose fat and help keep it off when combined with diet and exercise!</strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>THIS FORM OF CAPSAICIN is in high demand &#8211; but very limited supply.</strong></em></p>
<p>Only a select group of supplement manufacturers can get access to this specific form of Capsaicin.</p>
<p>Whether you are making progress but can’t seem to blast that last bit of fat, or are just getting started and have a long way to go, you can provide support to help SPEED UP fat loss once you tell your fat cells how to communicate with each other!</p>

<p>Did you know that all of the <em>POSITIVE</em> things you do to get your body in tip-top shape could be having a <em>NEGATIVE</em> impact on your overall health?</p>
<p>Don’t take this the wrong way. The health hazard we are about to tell you about happens to people of any age, weight, or fitness level! This is because the majority of what causes it is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">unavoidable</span>!</p>
<p>Losing fat, building lean muscle, killing it in the gym, and following a diet is GOOD. This information is far from your “get out of jail free card” to stop doing these things. However, what we are about to discuss may very well be THE REASON you aren’t seeing optimal results, despite your efforts!</p>
<p>You see, even GOOD things like diet and training could potentially backfire and create a BAD thing called OXIDATIVE STRESS. This type of stress happens when <em><strong>free radicals</strong></em> and antioxidants in your body are out of balance.</p>
<p>Since we are regularly exposed to <em><strong>free radicals</strong></em>, even if you never step on a treadmill, lift a weight, or follow a meal plan, you are still at high risk for this type of oxidative stress.</p>
<p>In fact, NOT exercising and eating nutritious food can also create a domino effect that could cause you to produce .. you guessed it .. excess free radicals!!</p>
<p><img class="size-large wp-image-6651" src="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/AdobeStock_295860038.jpeg?resize=1024%2C480&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="480" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/AdobeStock_295860038.jpeg?resize=1024%2C480&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/AdobeStock_295860038.jpeg?resize=300%2C141&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/AdobeStock_295860038.jpeg?resize=768%2C360&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/AdobeStock_295860038.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/AdobeStock_295860038.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><strong>What are <em>FREE RADICALS?</em></strong><br />
We won’t get into some boring chemistry lesson. All you need to know is that free radicals are unstable molecules, and too many of them can damage the cells in your body. Whatever organ a cell belongs to won’t function properly if this happens.</p>
<p>Our bodies are home to over <strong>37 trillion cells</strong> that control everything we do! The health of our cells dictates the appearance of our hair and skin, determines our mood, impacts the gut, regulates metabolism, etc. So you can see how an excess of free radicals could severely negatively impact you .. physically, mentally, and aesthetically!</p>
<p>Sometimes we are the ones responsible for creating this imbalance….</p>
<ul>
<li>Train too much = excess free radicals.</li>
<li>Don’t sleep enough = excess free radicals.</li>
<li>Have an overly restrictive diet and/or inadequate nutrition = excess free radicals.</li>
<li>Eat too many fried or processed foods = excess free radicals.</li>
<li>Stress/Anxiety = excess free radicals.</li>
<li>Smoking = excess free radicals.</li>
<li>Drinking too much alcohol = excess free radicals.</li>
<li>+MORE</li>
</ul>
<p>But there are other ways free radicals are produced in the body that we can’t avoid entirely&#8230;.</p>
<ul>
<li>Exposure to toxins/chemicals</li>
<li>Pesticides</li>
<li>Radiation</li>
<li>Pollutants</li>
<li>Solvents</li>
<li>Secondhand cigarette smoke</li>
<li>+MORE</li>
</ul>
<p>In short, whether you are in our control of them or not, when free radicals take over the body, cells become exhausted and STOP functioning properly.</p>
<p>Over time, what happens next is something called… <em><strong>CELLULAR BURNOUT!!</strong></em></p>
<p><img class="size-large wp-image-6649" src="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/AdobeStock_212626161.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/AdobeStock_212626161.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/AdobeStock_212626161.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/AdobeStock_212626161.jpeg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/AdobeStock_212626161.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/AdobeStock_212626161.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This creates a host of NEGATIVE side effects…..</p>
<ul>
<li>Fatigue</li>
<li>Lacking Endurance/Stamina</li>
<li>Bloating/Constipation</li>
<li>Low Sex Drive</li>
<li>Lackluster Skin</li>
<li>Brittle Hair &amp; Nails</li>
<li>Stalled Weight Loss</li>
<li>Fat Gain</li>
<li>Trouble Sleeping</li>
<li>Anxiety</li>
<li>Brain Fog</li>
<li>+ MUCH MORE</li>
</ul>
<p>You are probably experiencing many of these symptoms but have been unable to pinpoint the reason why. Now you know, it is most likely because of something you have likely never even heard of .. and that is <em><strong>CELLULAR BURNOUT!</strong></em></p>
<p>To make matters worse, as the body ages, it loses its ability to fight the effects of free radicals.</p>
<p><em><strong>The good news is that it’s not too late!</strong></em></p>
<p>You can fix CELLULAR BURNOUT by focusing on something called CELLULAR OPTIMIZATION.</p>
<p>Your body is a sum of its cells. This means that the healthier your cells are, the better you will look and feel. The problem is that you aren’t giving your cells what they need to be optimal.</p>
<p><img class="size-large wp-image-6652" src="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/AdobeStock_298726227.jpeg?resize=1024%2C768&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="768" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/AdobeStock_298726227.jpeg?resize=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/AdobeStock_298726227.jpeg?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/AdobeStock_298726227.jpeg?resize=768%2C576&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/AdobeStock_298726227.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/AdobeStock_298726227.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em><strong>How do we know this?</strong></em></p>
<p>Even the BEST DIET can not provide the fuel our cells need to THRIVE and cancel out all these excess free radicals. Add on all the stressors placed on your body (mentioned above), and a domino effect occurs until eventually your cells stop cooperating and TOTALLY BURNOUT!</p>
<p><strong>So how exactly can you OPTIMIZE the trillions of different cells in your body?</strong><br />
Simply put, you need to replace the BAD FUEL you are giving your cells (stress, processed foods, pollutants, etc.) with CLEAN FUEL (vitamins, minerals, antioxidants, etc.)</p>
<p><em><strong>You may be thinking…</strong></em><br />
<em>“Well, that is easy! I’ll just eat healthily, get enough sleep, and make sure I take a multivitamin.”</em></p>
<p><strong>Not so fast&#8230;</strong><br />
When it comes to CELLULAR BURNOUT, eating healthy, taking vitamins, and getting sleep, just won’t cut it!!</p>
<p>SCIENCE PROVES that our cells need VERY SPECIFIC superfoods in VERY SPECIFIC dosages to thrive.</p>
<p>This is exactly why our team at V Shred and Sculpt Nation has spent years, as well as hundreds of thousands of dollars, to come up with THE PERFECT SOLUTION to beat and treat cellular burnout!</p>
<p>This solution SHOULD cost you HUNDREDS of dollars every single month! We know that isn’t realistic, so we came up with a protocol that will cost you as little as just over ONE DOLLAR a day!</p>
<p><em><strong>WHAT IS IT?</strong></em><br />

<p>Try adding Greek or coconut yogurt to your oatmeal and fill your bowl with almond milk. Then add a teaspoon of chia seeds and another of flax seeds for a few extra calories. Add fresh berries on top for sweetness. This breakfast meal is also a great <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/pre-workout-meal-for-more-energy-quick-healthy-recipe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pre-workout meal</a> because it&#8217;s filled with healthy calories that&#8217;ll give you an extra boost of energy.</p>
<h3>5. Yogurt Parfait</h3>
<p>Yogurt is a healthy food filled with protein. Greek yogurt is a great alternative to other sugar-filled varieties because it has half the carbohydrates and sodium of most products. Create the layers with granola, some berries, and the yogurt. The granola will give this quick breakfast some crunch while the berries will sweeten it.</p>
<h3>6. Avocado Egg Pizza</h3>
<p>This pizza isn&#8217;t like your greasy calorie-loaded fast food pizza. It&#8217;s made from a few ingredients that are filled with protein and fiber. Instead of using a dough for the base, buy whole grain tortillas. Then mix lemon juice with the avocado and spread it over both sides of the tortilla. Place it in a skillet over medium heat and decorate it with egg slices.</p>
<div id="drinks" class="anchor"></div>
<h3>Drinks to Lose Weight</h3>
<h3>7. Blueberry Banana Smoothie</h3>
<p>Drinking this blueberry banana smoothie is a healthy and feel-good way to kickstart your day. Adding tofu and using soy milk will lower the drink&#8217;s calories and increase its protein content. To make this smoothie, throw a cup of berries, raw spinach, frozen blueberries, a banana, and some tofu in a blender and blend until smooth.</p>
<h3>8. Apple Cider Vinegar and Papaya Smoothie</h3>
<p>Detox drinks are great weight loss recipes that are easy to make while also being quick and delicious to consume. This detox smoothie is made from <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/weight-loss-with-apple-cider-vinegar/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">apple cider vinegar</a> which is a great detoxing ingredient that&#8217;s effective for weight loss. To mask its acidity, add papaya slices to your cider smoothie and some crushed peppercorn.</p>
<h3>9. Coffee with Flax Seed and Dark Chocolate</h3>
<p>Caffeine is an active agent that induces weight loss. Combining this morning pick-me-up with flax seeds will help reduce inflammation and insulin resistance. The additional dark chocolate is great for taste but it also helps lengthen your satiety and prevent the digestion, synthesis, and absorption of fatty acids.</p>
<h3>10. Minty Green Tea</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-5508 size-full" src="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/mug-of-green-tea-and-teapot-weight-loss-recipes-ss.jpg?resize=625%2C400&#038;ssl=1" alt="Minty Green Tea | Weight Loss Recipes for Every Meal" width="625" height="400" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/mug-of-green-tea-and-teapot-weight-loss-recipes-ss.jpg?w=625&amp;ssl=1 625w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/mug-of-green-tea-and-teapot-weight-loss-recipes-ss.jpg?resize=300%2C192&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>Boil the green tea for 5 minutes before adding the mint leaves. Boil it again for another 5 minutes and then strain it. Green tea has properties that mobilize fat for weight loss while mint is filled with antioxidants and helps prevent you from having a common cold, allergies, gastritis, and irritable bowel syndromes.</p>
<h3>11. Toasted Coconut Protein Smoothie</h3>
<p><!-- instagram error: invalid instagram resource --></p>
<p>An extra intake of protein can keep you feeling full a lot longer which makes protein smoothies a great snack in between meals or as a substitute. Throw a scoop or two of your protein powder into the blender along with some coconut flakes and coconut milk.</p>
<h3>12. Low-Calorie Celery Smoothie</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-5509 size-full" src="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Green-smoothie-with-mint-and-celery-weight-loss-recipes-ss.jpg?resize=625%2C400&#038;ssl=1" alt="Low-Calorie Celery Smoothie | Weight Loss Recipes for Every Meal" width="625" height="400" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Green-smoothie-with-mint-and-celery-weight-loss-recipes-ss.jpg?w=625&amp;ssl=1 625w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Green-smoothie-with-mint-and-celery-weight-loss-recipes-ss.jpg?resize=300%2C192&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>Celery contains no calories, which forces your body to burn more energy to properly digest and absorb it. It&#8217;s a great addition to weight loss recipes because it can boost lipid metabolism and lower bad cholesterol levels. Add in a tablespoon of apple cider vinegar to increase the smoothie&#8217;s weight loss benefits.</p>

<h3>17. Avocado Chickpea Tuna Salad</h3>
<p>Tuna is a rich source of daily protein and having it in your salad means you don&#8217;t need to cook anything.

<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-5511 size-full" src="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/boiled-eggs-weight-loss-recipes-ss.jpg?resize=625%2C400&#038;ssl=1" alt="Hard-Boiled Eggs | Weight Loss Recipes for Every Meal" width="625" height="400" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/boiled-eggs-weight-loss-recipes-ss.jpg?w=625&amp;ssl=1 625w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/boiled-eggs-weight-loss-recipes-ss.jpg?resize=300%2C192&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>

They&#8217;re filled with protein and healthy fats to help with your weight loss goals and muscle building. They&#8217;re the perfect healthy snack because eggs are low in calories and carbs.</p>
<h3>21. Flavored Almonds</h3>
<p><!-- instagram error: invalid instagram resource --></p>
<p>Eating plain almonds can get boring after a while so it won&#8217;t hurt to try flavored ones. Just make sure you keep an eye out for flavored almonds with low sodium levels to prevent that bloated feeling. Almonds are great weight loss snacks because they&#8217;re filled with healthy fats that help keep you feeling full for a longer time.</p>
<h3>22. Apple Nachos</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-5512 size-full" src="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Loaded-apple-nachos-with-caramel-weight-loss-recipes-ss.jpg?resize=625%2C400&#038;ssl=1" alt="Apple Nachos | Weight Loss Recipes for Every Meal" width="625" height="400" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Loaded-apple-nachos-with-caramel-weight-loss-recipes-ss.jpg?w=625&amp;ssl=1 625w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Loaded-apple-nachos-with-caramel-weight-loss-recipes-ss.jpg?resize=300%2C192&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>Apple nachos doesn&#8217;t sound like a real thing but it&#8217;s just apple slices with peanut butter, cinnamon, and muesli. Spread the peanut butter on the apple slice and cover it muesli and cinnamon. Apples are low-calorie snacks without the carbs and muesli is a great alternative to some granolas with added sugars and oils.</p>
<h3>23. Baked Zucchini Chips</h3>
<p>Instead of reaching out for that packet of salty and fatty crisps in the grocery, go to the vegetable section and grab a zucchini. Cut it into thin slices and season it with olive oil, salt, and pepper before baking it in the oven for 25-30 minutes. You can also sprinkle some paprika on top for added flavor.</p>
<h3>24. Turkey and Avocado Roll-Ups</h3>
<p>Roll-ups are simple snacks to make and great for satisfying sudden hunger. Wrapping avocado slices in a slice of lean turkey breast makes for a protein-packed snack that has no carbs. You can also add mustard into this roll-up for some flavor and an extra metabolism boost.</p>
<h3>25. 5-Ingredient Gluten-Free Cookie</h3>
<p>This cookie packs a ton of protein and enough carbs to help muscle growth. This <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/post-workout-cookie-recipe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">5-ingredient cookie</a> has enough protein in it to replace your protein shake. All you need are ground almonds, gluten-free oats, dates, a ripe banana, almond butter, and your choice of either seeds, nuts, or dried fruits.</p>
<div id="dinners" class="anchor"></div>

<p>Make your own <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/chicken-veggies-stir-fry-recipe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">chicken and veggies stir-fry</a> without any soy sauce and unhealthy oil. Use olive oil to stir-fry the chicken and veggies and substitute the soy sauce with Italian seasoning. The olive oil will add an extra flavor to your stir-fry.</p>
<h3>26. Sheet-Pan Tilapia and Vegetable Medley</h3>
<p>The best dinner ideas are the ones you can make in an instant and which are also easy to clean up.

<p>This <a href="https://damndelicious.net/2014/03/22/cauliflower-chowder/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">creamy cauliflower chowder</a> is low in carbs and easy to make. In a pot, cook the garlic, carrots, onion, celery, and cauliflower. Then whisk in the chicken broth and milk and boil until the cauliflower is tender.

<h3>38. Skinny Lasagna Rolls</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-5514 size-full" src="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Vegan-zucchini-lasagna-rolls-weight-loss-recipes-ss.jpg?resize=625%2C400&#038;ssl=1" alt="Skinny Lasagna Rolls | Weight Loss Recipes for Every Meal" width="625" height="400" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Vegan-zucchini-lasagna-rolls-weight-loss-recipes-ss.jpg?w=625&amp;ssl=1 625w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Vegan-zucchini-lasagna-rolls-weight-loss-recipes-ss.jpg?resize=300%2C192&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>Craving the creamy sauce of lasagna but don&#8217;t want the carbs? You can easily replace high-carb pasta with <a href="https://www.skinnytaste.com/zucchini-lasagna/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">zucchini pasta</a>.

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A very common question for anyone looking to drop a few pounds is, “how many calories should I eat to lose weight?” Check out these frequently asked questions about dieting and calorie consumption.</p>

<h2>How Many Calories Should I Eat to Lose Weight | FAQs</h2>
<div id="what" class="anchor"></div>
<h3>What Are Calories?</h3>
<p>Calories are units of energy measurement. Foods, drinks, supplements, and even condiments all contain calories. We can also measure how much energy we use by counting the calories we burn in a day.</p>
<p>If you want to achieve your fitness goals, you need to be mindful of how many calories you consume in a single day. Remember: to lose weight, the basic rule is to be in caloric deficit &#8211; eat fewer calories than you burn.</p>
<div id="how" class="anchor"></div>
<h3>How Many Calories Should I Eat to Lose Weight?</h3>
<p>The amount of calories you need to eat depends on a number of different factors including your age, weight, body, gender, and activity level. That being said, each person has unique individual attributes that are the basis of caloric needs and consumption.</p>
<p>The average female requires approximately 2,000 calories per day, while males generally require around 2,500 calories. With these basic needs in mind, to maintain weight, a female should target a diet consisting of 2000 calories and males should consume 2500 calories.</p>
<p>With respect to weight loss, being in a caloric deficit is the goal. In general, a healthy deficit is 300-500 calories below an individual&#8217;s caloric needs. Considering the above information, women should target 1500-1700 calories per day and men should target 2000-2200 calories per day.</p>
<div id="keep" class="anchor"></div>
<h3>How Do I Keep Track Of The Number Of Calories I Consume?</h3>
<p><!-- instagram error: invalid instagram resource --></p>
<p>If you want a more accurate number to follow, you can use a calorie calculator. There are plenty of online calculators that can help you determine how much you need to eat to lose weight and maintain lean muscle.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that these are just tools to help you count your calories. They can assist you in creating a fitness plan, but they won’t be your complete diet guide.</p>
<p>If you’re looking for a more customized fitness plan, men can try the <a href="https://vshred.com/programs/custom-training-and-diet-plan-8-week" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Custom Diet and Training Plan for Him</a> by V Shred.

<div id="many" class="anchor"></div>
<h3>How Many Calories Should I Eat to Lose Weight Without Exercise?</h3>
<p>While you may be able to shed off a few pounds through calorie-restriction alone, you’ll also be sacrificing lean muscle by doing so. If you want to achieve a lean, fit body, you need to combine proper diet with <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/best-workout-to-lose-weight-in-only-4-minutes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">regular exercise</a>.</p>
<div id="can" class="anchor"></div>
<h3>How Can I Lose Weight Without Starving Myself?</h3>
<p>The best way to still feel full even if you&#8217;re cutting back on calories is to avoid junk foods that offer zero nutrients. Chips, cakes, and beer contain empty calories that don’t provide any nutritional value.</p>
<p>If you want to feel full even on a low-calorie diet, opt to eat healthier meals with vitamins and nutrients. Also, replace sugary drinks such as sodas and juices with water, black coffee, or unsweetened tea.</p>
<p>Additionally, proteins and healthy fats help satiate the human body, meaning that consumption of protein-rich and healthy fatty foods will help to keep you fuller for longer periods of time.</p>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> A good way to avoid unhealthy snacking is to prepare your meals ahead of time. This is what we call <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/meal-plan-lose-weight/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">meal prepping</a>.</p>
<p>Having your meals prepped and ready to grab and go often helps individuals stick to a plan and improves their will-power to abstain from snacking on simple, empty calorie snacks.</p>
<p>If you don’t know how to cook even a single dish, don’t worry. You can check out our <a href="https://vshred.com/sp/recipe-guide/v1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recipe guide</a> here at V Shred for loads of healthy, delicious, and nutritious meals.</p>

<p>One of the best <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/tips-on-how-to-lose-weight-get-in-shape-3-reason-this-works/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ways to lose weight</a> is to decrease the calories you consume while increasing the amount of exercise you do.

<p>Something as simple as cutting out fast food from your diet will go a long way in your fitness journey. Overall, remember to eat healthy, consume fewer calories, load up on nutrients, maintain a diet rich in proteins and healthy fats, and drink plenty of water.</p>

<h2>7-Day Meal Plan to Lose Weight</h2>
<div id="1" class="anchor"></div>
<h3><strong>Day 1</strong></h3>
<h3><span style="color: #000080;">1. Breakfast | Oatmeal with Fruit</span></h3>
<p>For breakfast, you can switch between a bowl of hot or cold oatmeal with some fresh fruit on the side. Hot oatmeal takes a longer time to digest, which will help keep you full a little longer.</p>
<p>Add a couple of tablespoons of Greek yogurt to amp up your protein intake.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #000080;">2. Morning Snack | Fruits</span></h3>
<p>If you&#8217;re hungry a few hours before lunchtime, you can <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/good-healthy-snacks-to-have-late-at-night/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">snack on</a> some fruits to satiate some of that hunger. Try two tangerines or an apple with a handful of nuts, dried apricots, or raisins to get you going.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #000080;">3. Lunch | Veggie</span></h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-2542 size-full" src="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/salad-fresh-veggies-vegetables-meal-plan-to-lose-weight-pb.jpg?resize=625%2C417&#038;ssl=1" alt="Lunch | Veggie | Follow This Fat Shedding Meal Plan To Lose Weight | 7-day diet meal plan" width="625" height="417" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/salad-fresh-veggies-vegetables-meal-plan-to-lose-weight-pb.jpg?w=625&amp;ssl=1 625w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/salad-fresh-veggies-vegetables-meal-plan-to-lose-weight-pb.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>Take two cups of soup filled with a mix of vegetables. Boil some chopped spinach and escarole in chicken to make a hearty veggie soup for lunch.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #000080;">4. Afternoon Snack | Carrots and Hummus</span></h3>
<p>Chop some carrot sticks and put some protein-packed hummus dip in a container for a quick snack in the afternoon. This perfect combination of protein, carbohydrates, and fats will help keep you going until dinner time.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #000080;">5. Dinner | Teriyaki Salmon and Veggies</span></h3>
<p>Bake 100 g of salmon at 400 degrees Fahrenheit for 10-15 minutes until it&#8217;s firm. Then steam chopped carrots and broccoli for 3-5 minutes.</p>
<p>Pour some teriyaki sauce over them and finish off with some sesame seeds.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #000080;">6. Dessert | Berries</span></h3>
<p>After dinner, if you&#8217;re still hungry, enjoy some light and sweet dessert. Snack on some blueberries, raspberries, or strawberries before you start getting ready for bed.</p>
<div id="2" class="anchor"></div>
<h3><strong>Day 2</strong></h3>
<h3><span style="color: #000080;">7. Breakfast | Berry Smoothie</span></h3>
<p>Start your day with a berry smoothie filled with fructose and protein. In a blender, mix a chopped banana, half a cup of strawberries, half a cup of nonfat milk, and half a cup of plain Greek yogurt.</p>
<p>You may also add some protein powder to turn this into a <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/healthy-protein-shake-recipes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">protein smoothie</a>.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #000080;">8. Morning Snack | Grapes or Nuts</span></h3>
<p>As a morning snack, keep yourself full with some 30 g of nuts or a handful of grapes. You can also have some strawberries left over from your berry smoothie.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #000080;">9. Lunch | Turkey Sandwich</span></h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-2540 size-full" src="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/bread-bun-cutlery-delicious-meal-plan-to-lose-weight-px.jpg?resize=625%2C417&#038;ssl=1" alt="Lunch | Turkey Sandwich | Follow This Fat Shedding Meal Plan To Lose Weight | simple meal plan to lose weight" width="625" height="417" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/bread-bun-cutlery-delicious-meal-plan-to-lose-weight-px.jpg?w=625&amp;ssl=1 625w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/bread-bun-cutlery-delicious-meal-plan-to-lose-weight-px.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>Make a sandwich with sliced roasted turkey breast, sliced tomatoes, and some baby greens with two slices of whole grain bread. Choose a bread that&#8217;s low in sodium to prevent water retention.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #000080;">10. Afternoon Snack | Pear and Popcorn</span></h3>
<p>If your turkey sandwich wasn&#8217;t enough, you can eat some air-popped popcorn and a pear. The popcorn will help satisfy your potato chip cravings while the pear will help satiate you.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #000080;">11. Dinner | Grilled Chicken and Veggies</span></h3>
<p>Grill 100 g of chicken, and roast a cup of Brussels sprouts and half a cup of sweet potatoes. Season the chicken and the vegetables with olive oil, pepper, and salt.</p>

<p>Blend your leftover berries with some vanilla extract and silken tofu until it is smooth.</p>
<div id="3" class="anchor"></div>
<h3><strong>Day 3</strong></h3>
<h3><span style="color: #000080;">13. Breakfast | Egg White Omelet</span></h3>
<p>Separate three egg whites from the yolks and mix it in a bowl with a fork. Pour the egg white mixture into a heated pan and top it off with grilled onions, mushrooms, and bell peppers.</p>
<p>Then add some ricotta cheese before you fold the omelet.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #000080;">14. Morning Snack | Watermelon</span></h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-2544 size-full" src="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/melon-fresh-juice-watermelon-juice-meal-plan-to-lose-weight-pb.jpg?resize=625%2C423&#038;ssl=1" alt="Morning Snack | Watermelon | Follow This Fat Shedding Meal Plan To Lose Weight | healthy diet" width="625" height="423" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/melon-fresh-juice-watermelon-juice-meal-plan-to-lose-weight-pb.jpg?w=625&amp;ssl=1 625w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/melon-fresh-juice-watermelon-juice-meal-plan-to-lose-weight-pb.jpg?resize=300%2C203&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>

<h3><span style="color: #000080;">15. Lunch | Tuna Salad</span></h3>

<h3><span style="color: #000080;">17. Dinner | Teriyaki Shrimp and Veggies</span></h3>
<p>Cook 100 grams of shrimp until it is bright pink. Then steam a cup of carrots and a cup of broccoli, and cook half a cup of brown rice.</p>
<p>Place the shrimp, veggies, and rice on a plate and add 2 tablespoons of teriyaki sauce.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #000080;">18. Dessert | Frozen Yogurt</span></h3>
<p>Before you go to bed, enjoy 3/4 cup of frozen nonfat and sugar-free yogurt. Choose whichever flavor you like and top it off with unsweetened berries to complement the yogurt.</p>
<div id="4" class="anchor"></div>
<h3><strong>Day 4</strong></h3>

<h3><span style="color: #000080;">24. Dessert | Fruit Smoothie</span></h3>
<p>Blend half of a banana, half a cup of frozen berries, a cup of plain yogurt, and 3/4 cup of crushed ice until smooth.</p>

<p>Toast half of a whole grain bagel. Then spread some fat-free ricotta cheese or cheese cream on the bagel and top it off with some sliced strawberries or other fruits.</p>
<p>If you want to pack some protein to your breakfast, top your bagel with yummy peanut butter &#8211; creamy or chunky &#8211; however way you want it!</p>
<h3><span style="color: #000080;">26. Morning Snack | Apple and Nuts</span></h3>

<h3><span style="color: #000080;">28. Afternoon Snack | Sweet Potato</span></h3>
<p>Wrap a batch of sweet potatoes in foil and cook at 425 degrees Fahrenheit for an hour. You can store these potatoes in the fridge for a week and just heat them in the microwave before eating them.</p>

<h3><span style="color: #000080;">29. Dinner | Steak </span>and<span style="color: #000080;"> Potatoes</span></h3>

<p>After a couple of low-calorie meals throughout the day, you deserve some steak. Eat 100 g of lean steak with roasted sweet potatoes and Brussel sprouts to fill you up.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #000080;">30. Dessert | Berry Mousse</span></h3>
<p>If you still have room for dessert, make another berry mousse. Blend any leftover berries with some vanilla extract and silken tofu until it&#8217;s smooth.</p>
<div id="6" class="anchor"></div>

<h3><span style="color: #000080;">31. Breakfast | Eggs and</span><span style="color: #000080;"> Toast</span></h3>

<p>Try to squash some of the berries to let their juice mix into the yogurt.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #000080;">35. Dinner | Mustard Salmon</span></h3>
<p>Prepare the mustard sauce by combining a quarter cup of sour cream, 2 tablespoons of mustard, and 2 teaspoons of lemon juice. Spread this mixture on both sides of a 100 g of salmon fillet.</p>
<p>Then broil the salmon for 10-12 minutes.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #000080;">36. Dessert | Chocolate Milk</span></h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-2548 size-full" src="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/chocolate-smoothie-milkshakes-meal-plan-to-lose-weight-pb.jpg?resize=625%2C634&#038;ssl=1" alt="Dessert | Chocolate Milk | Follow This Fat Shedding Meal Plan To Lose Weight" width="625" height="634" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/chocolate-smoothie-milkshakes-meal-plan-to-lose-weight-pb.jpg?w=625&amp;ssl=1 625w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/chocolate-smoothie-milkshakes-meal-plan-to-lose-weight-pb.jpg?resize=296%2C300&amp;ssl=1 296w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/chocolate-smoothie-milkshakes-meal-plan-to-lose-weight-pb.jpg?resize=60%2C60&amp;ssl=1 60w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>Chocolate isn&#8217;t always bad in a meal plan to lose weight. Choose nonfat milk, and don&#8217;t add any sugar into your chocolate dessert.</p>
<div id="7" class="anchor"></div>
<h3><strong>Day 7</strong></h3>
<h3><span style="color: #000080;">37. Breakfast |  Overnight Oats</span></h3>
<p>If you need to start the day early, try making overnight nights again. Take out your premade cold oatmeal and enjoy it with half a tablespoon of honey and berries or sliced almonds.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #000080;">38. Morning Snack | Nuts and Banana</span></h3>
<p>Have a banana in the morning if your oats weren&#8217;t enough to fuel you until lunchtime. To extend your energy a little longer, nuts prove to be very helpful.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #000080;">39. Lunch | Salmon Wrap</span></h3>
<p>Instead of using turkey breast, wrap 75 g of smoked salmon in a whole wheat tortilla wrap. Don&#8217;t&#8217; forget to spread some avocado on the wrap and squeeze in some mixed greens to make this tasty and healthy lunch!</p>
<h3><span style="color: #000080;">40. Afternoon Snack | Carrots and Hummus</span></h3>
<p>Slice a carrot into small sticks and carry them in a container with some hummus. Enjoy this delicious and healthy snack anywhere.</p>
<p>You may also substitute the carrot with some snap peas.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #000080;">41. Dinner | Veggie Pizza</span></h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-4895 size-full" src="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/cheese-close-up-cooking-Meal-Plan-To-Lose-Weight.jpg?resize=625%2C375&#038;ssl=1" alt="Dinner | Veggie Pizza | Follow This Fat Shedding Meal Plan To Lose Weight" width="625" height="375" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/cheese-close-up-cooking-Meal-Plan-To-Lose-Weight.jpg?w=625&amp;ssl=1 625w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/cheese-close-up-cooking-Meal-Plan-To-Lose-Weight.jpg?resize=300%2C180&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>After a week of healthy eating, it&#8217;s time for a simple cheat meal. Have two slices of veggie pizza and a green salad on the side.</p>
<p>Try using lentil flour when making your pizza crust to pack some proteins into your cheat treat. Instead of having dessert, have a glass of wine to go with your dinner.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This 7-day meal plan to lose weight offers a variety of dishes and snacks that don&#8217;t limit your <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/11-low-calorie-snacks-to-eat-throughout-the-day" target="_blank" rel="noopener">calorie intake</a> but, instead, replace common processed foods with salt and sugar which can boost weight gain.

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">The best cardio workout can be difficult to find. But here’s one that will get you out of the gym and burn tons of calories!</p>
<div class="embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9 mb-5">

</div>
<div></div>
<p class="p1">Remember, in order to get in shape fast, you need to understand your body type. <a href="https://vshred.com/sp/survey/survey-aka1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">If you want to learn exactly what you should be doing to get in shape, take this free body type quiz now!</a></p>
<p class="p1">Truth is, there are tons of HIIT workouts all over the internet..</p>
<p class="p1">But what makes a HIIT workout the best cardio workout for you to do?</p>
<p class="p1">That’s obviously a difficult question that comes down to a few things..</p>
<ol>
<li class="p1">Does it work?</li>
<li class="p1">Do you enjoy it?</li>
<li class="p1">Will you be able to continue doing it?</li>
</ol>
<p class="p1">Luckily for you, this stair workout fits all of those!</p>
<p class="p1">It’s a short, but extremely effective high intensity workout. Also, it’s a great change of scenery from the typical gym cardio workout, so it’s easier to continue to be willing to do it!</p>
<h2 class="p1">The Best Cardio Workout</h2>
<p class="p1">This workout will only require a set of stairs. Bleachers or just a simple staircase will suffice.</p>
<p class="p1">There will be five different types of exercises using the stairs. You will go up the stairs performing the exercises as fast as you can, then slowly return back to the bottom as an active rest. We will do 3 sets of each exercise.</p>
<h3 class="p1">The Exercises</h3>
<h4 class="p1">Single Stair Alternating Feet</h4>
<p class="p1">For these, you will act as if you are going up stairs in regular style. Be sure to chop your arms so you can climb the stairs faster. Go all the way up to the top, then return back down slowly and repeat for 3 sets.</p>
<h4 class="p1">Double Stair Alternating Feet</h4>
<p class="p1">For these, you will do the same as the first exercise, but you will skip a step with each foot. Again, chop your arms to climb the stairs faster then return back down slowly as your rest. Repeat for 3 sets.</p>
<h4 class="p1">Single Stair Double Feet</h4>
<p class="p1">Here, you will stand on the bottom step and take both feet and hop up to the next step. Do this on every step, as quickly as you can, until you have reached the top. Then return back down slowly as your rest and repeat for 3 sets.</p>
<h4 class="p1">Stair Jumps</h4>
<p class="p1">For these, you will stand on the bottom and leap up as many steps as you can in one jump. Once you’ve landed safely on the next step, repeat the same and leap as many stairs as you can once again. Be sure to squat down and explode up. Once you’ve reached the top return back down slowly and repeat for 3 sets.</p>
<h4 class="p1">Single Stair Quick Feet</h4>
<p class="p1">For this last exercise, you will be moving your feet quickly and in short ranges of motion. Starting at the bottom, you will take one foot and bring it up to the next step. Then immediately bring the other foot up to the same step and move on to the next step. Work your way all the way up and return back down slowly. Repeat for 3 sets and you’re done!</p>
<p class="p1">To get the fastest results, do this workout 3 times per week. If you liked it, please don’t forget to share and leave your comments down below!</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Achieving your fitness goals doesn&#8217;t happen overnight. Fortunately, there are fast weight loss diets you can follow to <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/weight-loss-workout-plan-best/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reach your ideal weight</a> faster.</p>
<p>As long as you put extra time and effort, you&#8217;ll definitely get your desired results sooner than later. Here are seven fast weight loss diets that have been proven effective.</p>
<h2>Fast Weight Loss Diets You Should Follow</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span style="color: #000080;">1. Ketogenic Diet</span></h3>
<p>What makes the ketogenic diet special is how it conditions and puts the body in a state called ketosis. In this state, your body starts to utilize substances called ketone bodies, which are produced by the breakdown of your body fat triglycerides.</p>
<p>In the keto diet, since your carbohydrates consumption goes down, the amount of glucose in your body goes down, too. The macro breakdown for this diet is 70 percent fats, 25 percent protein, and 5 percent carbs.</p>
<p>Going through the keto diet makes your fullness level goes up much faster. It also makes your brain work better since it responds well to ketone bodies.</p>
<p>There are also consequences when you undergo ketosis. Since the body&#8217;s glucose level is low, you won&#8217;t have enough energy to spend on activities and workouts that require bursts of energy.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #000080;">2. 3-hour Diet</span></h3>
<p>Created by fitness expert George Cruz, the three-hour diet requires you to eat five times a day. By eating these small meals every three hours, you are boosting your body&#8217;s fat-burning potential.</p>
<p>This diet comes with four rules. First, you should eat your breakfast within the first hour of waking up.</p>
<p>The second is eating every three hours after breakfast. The third rule is to stop eating three hours before bedtime.</p>
<p>The last rule is to stick to the recommended food calorie content of 400 calories on average. In it, lean foods are prioritized over fatty ones.</p>
<p>Even all your favorite sweet and salty treats are allowed, but you can only consume them on a certain schedule.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #000080;">3. Low-carb Diet</span></h3>
<p><!-- instagram error: invalid instagram resource --></p>
<p>Reducing consumption of food rich in sugar and starch forces your body to burn stored fats and not carbs for energy. You will also start to crave food less which, when coupled with a regular workout regimen, will yield better fitness results.</p>
<p>It also reduces your insulin levels, resulting in your kidneys flushing out extra water and sodium from your body. You will start to feel less bloated and a lot lighter.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #000080;">4. Carb Cycling Diet</span></h3>
<p><img class="alignnone" src="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/potatoes-hamburger-fries-meal-Fast-Weight-Loss-Diets-us.jpg?resize=625%2C418&#038;ssl=1" alt="Carb Cycling Diet | Fast Weight Loss Diets That Actually Work | protein" width="625" height="418" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>Going on a diet is no easy task, especially when you&#8217;re going for a low-calorie, low-carb diet. Depriving the body of carbohydrates has benefits if done in a short-term period. Otherwise, it will have adverse effects on your health.</p>
<p>Carb cycling is a planned manipulation and variation of carbohydrate intake to not deprive the body of natural nutrients and to maintain its metabolism. A menu is planned weekly to closely monitor the number of carbs and calories the body takes in without compromising your fitness and health goals.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #000080;">5. Cookie Diet</span></h3>
<p>This diet literally only requires cookies, so shopping will be a breeze. But, you need to buy specific cookies for breakfast, lunch, and snacks.</p>
<p>The ones you should eat must still be in small portions. Try to limit your consumption to 1,000 cals a day.</p>
<p>The point of this diet is for a person to take in fewer calories which, in turn, allows for more weight loss. The downside of this diet is it can get pricey.</p>
<p>The average cost for a two-week supply of cookies is $250.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #000080;">6. Raw Food Diet</span></h3>
<p>Your oven gets a little more rest since all processed and cooked food are out the window in this diet. Though it can get expensive, the benefit here is it preserves your food&#8217;s nutrients and natural enzymes.</p>
<p>Your body needs both since they boost digestion and battle chronic disease.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #000080;">7. Vegan Diet</span></h3>
<p>The vegan diet restricts you from eating fish, meat, or any animal meat products and revolves around fruits and vegetable consumption. On top of vitamins and minerals found in fruits and veggies, this diet also supplies the right amount of protein, calcium, and iron.</p>
<p>You also need the b12 supplement to further reinforce the macros you get from this particular diet.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you plan on getting cut and lean, you should start thinking about high protein diet plans. Every part of your body uses protein to grow and function, and if you don&#8217;t get enough protein, your body can suffer. High protein diet plans can help you with weight loss, stabilize your blood sugar levels, boost your metabolism, and improve your energy. If you&#8217;re thinking about starting a high-protein diet, keep these tips in mind.</p>
<h2>High Protein Diet Plans You Should Look Into to Get Cut</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span style="color: #000080;">1. Avoid a Lack of Protein</span></h3>
<p>A lack of protein can wreak havoc on your body in a number of ways. In particular, if you&#8217;re on a low-calorie diet plan and you don&#8217;t get enough protein, your body starts to shed muscle instead of fat.</p>
<p>You may also suffer from fatigue, depression, anxiety, and anemia (low iron). Your body relies on nine essential amino acids, and when you don&#8217;t get enough protein, you experience a deficiency of these amino acids.</p>
<p>Your exact symptoms can vary depending on which amino acids your body is missing.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #000080;">2. Try These High-Protein Foods</span></h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-1849 size-full" src="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/salmon-egg-cheese-vegetables-high-protein-diet-plans-us.jpg?resize=625%2C388&#038;ssl=1" alt="Try These High-Protein Foods | High Protein Diet Plans To Get Cut and Lean | high-protein diet" width="625" height="388" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/salmon-egg-cheese-vegetables-high-protein-diet-plans-us.jpg?w=625&amp;ssl=1 625w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/salmon-egg-cheese-vegetables-high-protein-diet-plans-us.jpg?resize=300%2C186&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px" data-recalc-dims="1" /><br />
Some of the best high-protein foods include lean grass-fed beef, organic chicken, salmon, eggs, bone broth, and goat cheese. When comparing different foods, take into account how much protein they offer based on their weight.</p>
<p>For instance, 3 ounces of lean beef has about 22 grams of protein, and three ounces of goat cheese has 21 grams of protein. In contrast with other foods, you may eat 3 ounces but get a lot less protein.</p>
<p>Also, remember to look at the food&#8217;s other advantages <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/whole-eggs-vs-egg-whites-which-is-best-for-you/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">such as vitamins</a>, minerals, healing benefits, pH levels, and so on. Most importantly, pay attention to how different foods make you feel.</p>
<p>If you get an energy boost after eating a certain food while another makes you feel sluggish, you need probably to focus on the first option.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #000080;">3. Focus on Lean Proteins</span></h3>
<p>As a general rule of thumb, you need one gram of lean protein for every pound of body weight. For instance, if you weigh 180 pounds, you need 180 grams of lean protein per day.</p>
<p>But depending on your weight loss goals, you may need to adjust that amount. This helps you to keep your lean muscle mass while losing unwanted fat.</p>
<p>In contrast, if you eat proteins with lots of fats, you will struggle to meet your weight loss goals.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #000080;">4. Don&#8217;t Avoid High-Protein Diets Because You&#8217;re Vegan</span></h3>
<p>When many people think of high-protein diets, they assume that you have to eat meat. Luckily, that isn&#8217;t the case.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re vegetarian or vegan, you can still enjoy a high protein diet. Lentils, black beans, and almonds are all extremely high-protein options.</p>
<p>You may also want to eat chia seeds, hummus (chickpeas), and soybeans as well as a variety of other nuts and beans. This type of diet is much healthier than simply trying to get by on sugars and carbs.</p>
<p>To ensure you get all the amino acids you need, consider focusing on complete proteins. On their own, foods such as quinoa, buckwheat, and soy are complete proteins. But in many other cases, you need to pair two foods to get a complete protein.</p>
<p>This includes iconic pairings such as rice and beans and hummus and pita.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #000080;">5. Minimize the Carbohydrates You Eat</span></h3>
<p>On the flip side of the coin, you need to avoid excess carbs when you&#8217;re on high protein diet plans. For a low-carb diet, stay away from simple sugars and basic carbs.</p>
<p>Instead, make the most of your calories by focusing on fiber-rich carbs such as oats and whole grain bread.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #000080;">6. Remember to Hydrate</span></h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-1848 size-full" src="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/adult-girl-drinking-water-beautiful-view-high-protein-diet-plans-px.jpg?resize=625%2C417&#038;ssl=1" alt="Remember to Hydrate | High Protein Diet Plans To Get Cut and Lean | weight loss" width="625" height="417" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/adult-girl-drinking-water-beautiful-view-high-protein-diet-plans-px.jpg?w=625&amp;ssl=1 625w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/adult-girl-drinking-water-beautiful-view-high-protein-diet-plans-px.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px" data-recalc-dims="1" /><br />
Water is essential when you&#8217;re on a high-protein, low-carb diet. Water helps your cells to function. It also lubricates joints, minimizes dry mouth, and promotes cardiovascular health.</p>
<p>On the outside, it keeps your skin looking supple and youthful. Inside of your body, it helps to filter waste. Additionally, if you don&#8217;t drink enough water, that can prevent your kidneys from functioning correctly, and your kidneys play a key role in high-protein diets.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #000080;">7. Stay Away from One-Size-Fits-All Diets</span></h3>
<p>Over the years, a number of high-protein diets have become popular. They include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Protein Power Diet</strong> — Developed in the 1990s, this diet involves over 54 percent fat, and it requires you to avoid carbs as well as fruits and starchy vegetables.</li>
<li><strong>The Zone Diet</strong> — Also from the mid-1990s, this diet created by Dr. Barry Sears consists of 40 percent carbohydrates, 30 percent protein, and 30 percent fat. It focuses on having frequent low calories snacks.</li>
<li><strong>The Atkins Diet</strong> — Focused on proteins and fat with a minimum of carbs, this diet was popular around the turn of the millennium. Although many people reported losing weight, the excessive amount of fat associated with this diet can increase the risk of kidney damage and heart disease or other issues.</li>
<li><strong>South Beach Diet</strong> — Debuted in 2003, the South Beach Diet allows more carbs than many other high-protein diets, but it restricts fruits and carrots because of their position on the glycemic index.</li>
<li><strong>Sugar Busters Diet</strong> — Unlike most high-protein diets, this plan is over half carbohydrates, but it minimizes simple starches such as white rice, white flour, potatoes, corn, and even carrots.</li>
<li><strong>Stillman Diet</strong> — One of the diets recommending the highest levels of protein, this diet pushes you toward a plan that is 64 percent protein, 33 percent fat, and just 3 percent carbohydrates.</li>
</ul>
<p>Although some people have had success with these diets, the main issue is that they offer a one-size-fits all approach to dieting. You need a plan that is customized to your size, your body type, and your objectives.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #000080;">8. Help Yourself Establish New Habits</span></h3>
<p>Whether you&#8217;re on a high-protein diet or any other type of <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/tips-on-how-to-lose-weight-get-in-shape-3-reason-this-works/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">weight loss plan</a>, you have to establish new habits and that can be hard. Keep in mind that on average, it takes about 66 days to establish a new habit. Some people get in the swing of things after 18 days, while others take several months.</p>
<p>Be aware that your new eating habits may take a while to become routine and take some steps to help yourself along the way.</p>
<p>Consider dieting with a friend or joining a challenge to keep yourself motivated. Take measurements and photographs so that you can see your progress along the way.</p>
<p>You may want to consider one-cheat meal per week. This gives some people something to look forward to during the week, making it easier to focus on their diet.</p>
<p>In other cases, you may find that you prefer to just stick to your diet because cheating once can turn into cheating all the time.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #000080;">9. Plan for Cravings</span></h3>
<p>As you settle into your new diet, cravings are inevitable. So that you don&#8217;t yield to them, you need to be prepared.</p>
<p>Stock up your cupboards with healthy high-protein snacks and get rid of the unnecessary carbohydrates in your home. When you&#8217;re out and about, bring healthy snacks.</p>
<p>Then, you&#8217;ll be less tempted consume a lot of calories at the vending machines or the fast food drive-through. Protein shakes and bars tend to work really to quench sugar cravings.</p>
