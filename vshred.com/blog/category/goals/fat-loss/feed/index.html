That is a scary number!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Good thing you found this article because </span><b><i>we aren’t going to let YOU be “most” people! </i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lower temps do not have to equal larger waistlines! You just have to have a plan! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this short read we will &#8230;</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Explain why winter weight gain happens. Knowing why is important if you want to prevent it and the reason is probably not what you think. In fact, it is partially not even your fault!</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tell you why fall/winter is actually the BEST time to start a diet and training plan.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Give you 7 easy pro tips that will help guide you through the next few months. </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You may believe winter weight gain happens because of the holidays. Those extra home cooked meals and holiday parties are certainly a factor. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But </span><b><i>there is a DAILY issue you need to be prepared to fight </i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">if you want to avoid packing on winter pounds.</span></p>
<p><b>WHY YOU REALLY PACK ON POUNDS AFTER LABOR DAY</b></p>
<p><img class="size-large wp-image-7471" src="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_130930953.jpeg?resize=1024%2C512&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="512" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_130930953.jpeg?resize=1024%2C512&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_130930953.jpeg?resize=300%2C150&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_130930953.jpeg?resize=768%2C384&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_130930953.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_130930953.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the spring and summer months, you are given what we call a</span><b> fitness freebie. </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You get a </span><b><i>seasonal motivation boost</i></b> <span style="font-weight: 400;">that doesn’t happen when temperatures start to drop, and you begin to pull out the chunky sweaters and comfy leggings. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not only is the sun shining (which makes you happier because of Vitamin D), you are wearing LESS clothing in the summer months. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I don’t know about you, but knowing I’m going to be exposing more skin makes walking in the gym a little easier. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Covering up in layers, no doubt leads to the temptation to slack on body goals! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Knowing your arms, legs, and abs will be less exposed can easily be an excuse to slack. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, being layered up often means you don’t SEE the extra pounds, so they are easier to ignore.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But there is more to it than being bundled up….</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-7477" src="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_236518834.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_236518834.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_236518834.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_236518834.jpeg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_236518834.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_236518834.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span>The #1 reason you slack on health and fitness goals in colder months ISN’T EVEN YOUR FAULT!!</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, you have a part to play in all of this, but</span><b><i> there is actually a scientific reason why you have less desire to train and eat healthy when the sunshine of summer fades.</i></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We will explain why a little further down. But ya know what really stinks? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The scientific reason why we all experience these motivation slumps in the winter only adds to an even bigger issue with motivation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span>It doesn’t matter what season it is motivation ALWAYS comes and goes!</p>
<p>Spring, Summer, Fall, or Winter &#8211; you can NEVER rely on it!</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, what can you do when lack of sunshine and warm temps leave you even more tempted to hit snooze and reach for comfort foods? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You certainly don’t throw your hands up in the air and wait until January to make a resolution to crash diet to get your body ready for spring. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Believe it or not, RIGHT NOW is actually the IDEAL time to get started! </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you </span><b><i>START NOW, </i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">you will develop discipline and a routine heading into the holidays. This will put you in a great place mentally and physically to relax and “indulge” a little more at all those holiday gatherings! </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><b><i>Look at it this way ..<br />
</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Would you rather head into the holiday season already making progress toward your goals and be in a great spot <em>(where it would be okay even if you did gain an extra pound or two?)</em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Or would you rather put it off and only add more fat on top of what you want to lose?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The answer is clear— the solution to getting the motivation needed to make it happen, not so much.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But don’t worry! We’ve got ya covered</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (no pun intended)</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with a few easy motivation hacks!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><b>7 TIPS TO STAY MOTIVATED AS SEASONS CHANGE</b></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><b><br />
</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the number one questions we always get is … “<em>I am just not motivated. How can I motivate myself to train and eat better?”</em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As we mentioned earlier, it doesn&#8217;t matter what season it is, </span><b><i>you can’t always rely on motivation. </i></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you have it, great! You should certainly take advantage of it! But you have to know that it is totally normal to not have much of it. Even professional athletes lack motivation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You have to develop other daily habits that create discipline if you want to succeed long term!</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are a few of our pro tips that we use with our clients, specifically when temperatures drop, and motivation seems to be at its lowest! </span></p>
<p><b>TIP #1: Switch To An At Home Training Program</b></p>
<p><img class="size-large wp-image-7448" src="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_185038762.jpeg?resize=1024%2C647&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="647" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_185038762.jpeg?resize=1024%2C647&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_185038762.jpeg?resize=300%2C189&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_185038762.jpeg?resize=768%2C485&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_185038762.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_185038762.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you know that getting out of bed and stepping into the winter elements is going to be an excuse trigger, make a plan to train at home during cooler months! Some of the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">most effective and challenging workouts </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">only require your body weight and </span><b><i>maybe</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a set of dumbbells or some resistance bands.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A good fat-blasting, muscle-building sweat session can 100% be achieved from the comfort of your home!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adjustable dumbbells, ankle weights, resistance bands, a jump rope, etc., are all things that are inexpensive and can easily be stored in a closet or under your bed and pulled out anytime you don’t feel like leaving the house.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But if you have </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">the right training program</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><b><i>you don’t need any of that. </i></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our favorite </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">at-home bodyweight-only program</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is called</span><b> MOVE. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was designed to help you achieve your fitness goals without a single piece of equipment, and each workout is under 20 minutes! </span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Learn more about MOVE by watching the video below!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you need </span><b>a little extra “nudge”</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to get up and get moving, another </span><b>pro-tip we use</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is keeping some </span><a href="https://sculptnation.com/products/pre-workout" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><b>PRE WORKOUT </b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">on your bedside table. Have it already blended up and chug it as soon as your alarm goes off!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By the time you have brushed your teeth and put on your workout clothes, you will have a nice little jolt of energy and</span><b><i> tons of motivation</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to get going before you have a chance to come up with an excuse! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the bottom of this article, we will tell you about a big end of summer sale happening so that you can stock up on our </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">favorite </span><a href="https://sculptnation.com/products/pre-workout" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><b>PRE WORKOUT</b></a><strong> for 40% off when you use code: LABORDAY40 at checkout! </strong></p>
<p><b>TIP #2: Make Your Workouts Seasonal</b></p>
<p><img class="size-large wp-image-7452" src="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_65703942.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_65703942.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_65703942.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_65703942.jpeg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_65703942.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_65703942.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Embrace the change of seasons and take advantage of activities that you can only do in fall or winter! </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Go on a fall hike and view all the gorgeous foliage.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Try rock climbing.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Walk around a corn maze or pumpkin patch with your family. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you live in a snowy climate, go skiing, sledding, build snowmen with your kids, etc.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Go ice skating.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lace-up your sneakers, go for a walk or run at night, and admire all the Christmas lights and decorations.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are some things you can only do and see during specific times of the year. So instead of missing sunshine and water sports, focus on all the positive things that only come about with cooler temps!</span></p>
<p><b>TIP #3: Try Something Totally New</b></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-7454" src="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_361152601.jpeg?resize=1024%2C514&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="514" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_361152601.jpeg?resize=1024%2C514&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_361152601.jpeg?resize=300%2C151&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_361152601.jpeg?resize=768%2C386&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_361152601.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_361152601.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sometimes a change of routine is all you need to boost motivation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you have been doing all your gym lifts alone, recruit a gym buddy! Try switching up your cardio by skipping your solo runs and joining a group fitness class instead. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another option is to </span><b><i>allow yourself to slow down!</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> If you have been crushing it all spring and summer with intense training and hardcore workouts, </span><b><i>it may actually be time to take it down a notch. </i></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Going full force 365 can cause your stress hormone cortisol to increase. This can lead to a host of drawbacks, including weight gain, muscle loss, poor moods, fatigue, and occasional issues sleeping! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We aren’t saying you should become lazy! But if you have been crushing it 24/7 all spring and summer, your body (and mind) may need to slow down.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Use the next few months to embrace a slower routine. </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Commit to daily yoga.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Focus on becoming more flexible.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Switch to low or moderate-intensity cardio, instead of HIIT.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Try out some bodyweight workouts instead of heavy lifting.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Giving your body a couple of months to recover might even make you more responsive when you decide to kick things up again come spring/summer!</span></p>
<p><b>TIP #4: Stay Accountable</b></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-7457" src="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_266584820.jpeg?resize=1024%2C768&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="768" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_266584820.jpeg?resize=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_266584820.jpeg?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_266584820.jpeg?resize=768%2C576&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_266584820.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_266584820.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><b><br />
</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">The best way to stick to a plan is to have someone that you report back to. This could be a friend, family member, a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">social media community</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, or even a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">coach. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Including someone else, or even just telling someone else about your health and fitness goals and asking them to check in with you to make sure you are sticking to the plan, is a great way to keep the promises you make to yourself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you prefer to fly solo, it helps to create visuals. Make a vision board, create a daily checklist you can mark off after each workout, or keep an accomplishment journal.</span></p>
<p><b>TIP #5: Set A Spring Goal</b></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-7458" src="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_47332240.jpeg?resize=1024%2C680&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="680" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_47332240.jpeg?resize=1024%2C680&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_47332240.jpeg?resize=300%2C199&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_47332240.jpeg?resize=768%2C510&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_47332240.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_47332240.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">March may seem like a long time away, but it will be back before you know it, and 6 months is a long time to make significant changes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Setting a goal is a great way to encourage yourself to push past discomforts and temptation, but there is a science to goal setting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The key to creating goals that stick .. </span><b><i>be REALISTIC and SPECIFIC!</i></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s start with </span><b><i>reality. </i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">You should always focus on one goal at a time and make sure you are being honest with yourself if that goal is really attainable.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you know that your schedule will never allow you to work out 6 days a week, why would you choose a program that requires you to do that?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you know it’s not healthy to attempt to lose 10 pounds a week, why would you aim that high?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you love carbs, why would you go on a KETO diet? </span></p>
<p><b><i>Doing these things will essentially set yourself up for failure.</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Set attainable goals that fit YOUR lifestyle. You can always bump things up if your schedule allows, or you notice you aren’t pushing yourself hard enough. Just keep in mind that being realistic isn’t the same as not believing in yourself or making excuses. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moving on to being </span><b><i>specific.</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The more specific you are about your goals, the more likely you will be to reach them. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It may seem like it’s good enough to say things like .. I want to look good, lose weight, or get ripped! </span><b><i>But you have to dig deeper than that!! </i></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wanting to “lose weight,” for example, is an excellent place to start. But ask yourself what that means to you?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you expand on that and say &#8212; “I want to lose 10 pounds of fat. I will do this by not eating any sweets and doing the V Shred </span><a href="https://vshred.com/sp/move/soc-all/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><b>MOVE </b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">program for 30 consecutive days. I am doing this because I want to have better self-esteem and a head start on bikini season.” &#8212; that makes your goal more specific.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The more specific (and attainable) your goals are, the more likely you will be to not give up!</span></p>
<p><b>TIP #6: Reward Yourself</b></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-7459" src="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/vin_sant_32048508_366936073798151_433609263865135104_n.jpg?resize=882%2C1024&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="882" height="1024" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/vin_sant_32048508_366936073798151_433609263865135104_n.jpg?resize=882%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 882w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/vin_sant_32048508_366936073798151_433609263865135104_n.jpg?resize=258%2C300&amp;ssl=1 258w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/vin_sant_32048508_366936073798151_433609263865135104_n.jpg?resize=768%2C892&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/vin_sant_32048508_366936073798151_433609263865135104_n.jpg?w=1080&amp;ssl=1 1080w" sizes="(max-width: 882px) 100vw, 882px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you have checked a “mini goal” off your list, treat yourself. Knowing that you have a reward coming to celebrate your efforts will make you want to achieve it even more. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It may be tempting to make your reward one of your favorite “forbidden foods” but we never suggest that you reward yourself this way.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You aren’t a dog. You should never reward “good behavior” with food. Having this mentality can create a really unhealthy relationship with food.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You need to eat healthy MOST of the time, control your portions, and see food as fuel. But if you are craving something that isn’t quite as healthy as your grilled chicken and rice, never feel like you need to lose 20 pounds to “deserve” a bite of cake, or nice dinner out with your family. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instead of rewarding yourself with food, buy yourself something you have been wanting. Maybe some new workout clothes, a massage, or an extra $20 bucks in your vacation fund! </span></p>

<p><b>TIP #7: Make Mental Health Top Priority</b></p>
<p><img class="size-large wp-image-7460" src="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_255894146.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_255894146.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_255894146.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_255894146.jpeg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_255894146.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_255894146.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Earlier, we mentioned that cold weather motivation dips may not be your fault.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’m sure you have heard of winter blues. Well, it’s a real thing. Less natural light can cause dips in serotonin, the neurotransmitter that regulates mood.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The dark and dreary days of winter can also cause your body to produce more of the sleep hormone melatonin. This shift can disrupt your body and impact your sleep patterns and overall mood.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are a few ways that you can focus on improving your mental health.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Invest in a light therapy box that simulates natural daylight.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Make sure you are supplementing with or eating plenty of foods with Vitamin D.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Start journaling. There is a lot of scientific evidence that supports putting your thoughts on paper provides a long list of benefits, including stress management, self-confidence, and goal setting. </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Suppose you still find yourself struggling with negative seasonal motivation shifts. In that case, you may need to experiment with taking</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> naturally sourced herbs</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to help support brain health and a positive mood.</span></p>
<p><b><i>Here are a few with some great scientific backing to help boost mood.</i></b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>EnXtra: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">A natural caffeine-free patent-pending botanical ingredient that has been shown to help increase dopamine levels.**It is also one of the first and only natural caffeine-free patent-pending botanical ingredients shown to boost mental alertness &amp; acuity for hours or ending in a huge caffeine energy crash.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Piper Nigrum Fruit Extract:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> A very specific type of black pepper that has been shown to help increase both serotonin and dopamine.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>L-Theanine:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> A powerful amino acid that is believed to help reduce occasional anxiety brought on by stressful situations.</span></li>
</ul>

<p><b><i>BOTTOM LINE IF YOU WANT TO STAY MOTIVATED YEAR ROUND</i></b><b><i><br />
</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you put away the shorts and swimsuits and shift out of bikini season, it’s common for motivation to “fall back” with the clocks. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The seasons have to change (unless you live near the equator) &#8211; so you have to figure out ways to</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">not let your fitness goals go into hibernation mode!</span><b><i> </i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pumpkin spice lattes are only here for a limited time, but getting into shape isn’t seasonal! </span><i>It&#8217;s a year-round commitment!!</i><i> </i></p>

<p>What if someone told you the reason you haven’t seen results, no matter what diet or training plan you follow, isn&#8217;t your fault?</p>
<p>What if there was a “biological hack” that could finally allow you to unleash and promote your full fat-blasting potential?</p>
<p>If researchers from places like Cambridge and Harvard are correct … there is!!</p>
<p><em><strong>The struggle is real&#8230;</strong></em><br />
Trying to re-shape your body by building lean muscle and losing body fat takes time and consistency.</p>
<p><em><strong>We all know that there is not a quick way to go about this.</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>But for some…</strong></em><br />
It doesn’t matter how hard they push, how many hours of cardio they log, or how many calories they restrict &#8211; the changes just don’t seem to happen. Or if they do &#8211; they are painfully slow.</p>
<p><em><strong>If this is you or someone you know…</strong></em> the information in this article could be life-changing!</p>
<p>Some of the top researchers from around the world wanted to find out why some people can’t lose weight no matter what or how hard they try.</p>
<p><em><strong>They made A MAJOR FAT BURNING DISCOVERY!!</strong></em></p>
<p>What we are sharing with you is something even those that don’t struggle with weight issues need to know because&#8230; <em><strong>the culprit is something we all have circulating through our bodies… waiting to attack our fat cells.</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>The reason every diet you have ever tried has failed could be something </strong></em><em><strong>in YOUR BLOOD.</strong></em></p>

<p>We are NOT talking about genetics.</p>
<p>The genes your parents gave you and your body type aren’t all that matter.<br />
Anyone can have too much of this circulating through their blood.</p>
<p><em><strong>The blame could be because of excess protein.</strong></em></p>
<p>Not the kind you eat. This is a protein that is flowing throughout your body right now even as you read this article, and<em><strong> its job is to BLOCK YOU FROM LOSING WEIGHT!</strong></em></p>
<p>No matter what type of lifestyle change you make&#8230; if you have too much of this protein in your blood&#8230; you could still struggle to lose fat.</p>
<p><em><strong>WHAT IS THIS FAT BLOCKING PROTEIN?!</strong></em><br />
It has a scientific name, but we are just going to call it <strong>THE FAT PROTEIN</strong> &#8211; because that is exactly what it does.<em><strong> It slows down your metabolism and sabotages your efforts to lose weight.</strong></em></p>
<p>These proteins attach themselves to your fat cells and virtually force your body to hold on to fat for dear life! They stop your metabolism from generating the kind of heat it needs to burn fat.</p>
<p>Scientists discovered that people that are overweight have MORE of this protein in their bloodstream.</p>
<p>But why? And what can you do about it?<br />
Keep reading!!</p>
<p><em><strong>HOW TO STOP YOUR BODY FROM MAKING “THE FAT PROTEIN”&#8230;</strong></em><br />
You need MORE FAT!</p>

<p>Hold up .. we aren’t talking about the kind of body fat you want to get rid of.<br />
We also aren’t referring to “healthy fats” you should eat.</p>
<p>You have TWO types of FAT CELLS in your body, and both play a role in your metabolism.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>White Fat</strong>: This is bad fat. It is responsible for storing excess fat to be later used for energy.</li>
<li><strong>Brown Fat</strong>: This is good fat. It creates heat in your body and revs up your fat-burning metabolism.</li>
</ul>
<p>Researchers found that this fat protein is only made by your WHITE (bad) fat cells.</p>
<p>If this is true, then logic would tell us that you can help tackle this by making LESS white fat and MORE brown fat, right?</p>
<p>How in the world can you do that? Is it even possible? YES!!</p>
<p><em><strong>HOW TO SUPPORT MAKING MORE METABOLISM BOOSTING BROWN FAT&#8230;</strong></em><br />
There are THREE things that researchers have found to help increase the amount of BROWN (good) fat cells that you have.</p>
<p>Unless you like being cold and hungry, you aren’t going to like the first two… they are extreme.</p>
<p>The third method is fast and easy. Researchers found that you can help support and restart your fat-loss engine <em><strong>with a single nutrient.</strong></em></p>
<p>There is an herb that has the potential to promote the conversion of unhealthy white fat cells into fat-burning, thermogenic, brown fat cells.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.sculptnation.com/turmeric-lp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img class="alignnone wp-image-7032 size-full" src="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_103813919.jpeg?resize=1170%2C780&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1170" height="780" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_103813919.jpeg?w=4200&amp;ssl=1 4200w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_103813919.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_103813919.jpeg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_103813919.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_103813919.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_103813919.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1170px) 100vw, 1170px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><em><strong>WHAT IS THIS SUPER NUTRIENT THAT INCREASES FAT BLASTING BROWN FAT??</strong></em><br />
It is an ancient herb that very well may be the most effective nutritional supplement in existence. You can purchase it almost anywhere, and it is pretty inexpensive.</p>
<p>Not only is it said to increase the production of brown fat .. this power-house herb has been shown to ….</p>
<ul>
<li>Balance Mood</li>
<li>Support a Healthy Inflammatory Response</li>
<li>Support Carbohydrate Metabolism</li>
<li>Ease Temporary, Activity Related Joint Pain/Stiffness</li>
<li>Support A Healthy Metabolism</li>
<li>Decrease Muscle Soreness</li>
</ul>
<p><em><strong>There is only one problem…</strong></em><br />
This nutrient is poorly absorbed into the bloodstream unless you consume it with other specific substances.</p>
<p>To see its benefits, you have to have a unique blend designed for maximum absorption, in specific ratios!</p>
<p>Quality also counts. Recent research found that some companies lace this ancient herb with pigments (many of which contained lead) &#8211; to enhance its color!</p>
<p><em><strong>Everyone reading this could benefit from this herb&#8230;</strong> </em><br />
But you must ensure the source is safe, and you use a blend that supports enhanced absorption. Otherwise, you are wasting your money.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>If you want to support the rapid production of more fat-burning brown fat and help slow down</strong></em><br />
<em><strong>this fat protein in your blood …</strong></em><br />

<p><a href="http://www.sculptnation.com/turmeric-lp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-7037 size-full" src="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/ezgif.com-video-to-gif.gif?resize=600%2C426&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="600" height="426" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>We will also tell you about those other two methods that could help your body produce more thermogenic brown fat. But we already know&#8230; Tip #3 is going to be what you choose!</p>
<p><strong>If you are…</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Sick of every diet failing.</li>
<li>Can’t fathom eating any less or training any more than you already do.</li>
<li>Fed up with putting in the work and not seeing results.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>And you want to add support to&#8230;</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Ensure your body is producing GOOD (brown) fat.</li>
<li>Limit the amount of “Fat Protein” flowing through your blood.</li>
<li>Finally, see the results you are working hard to achieve.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>You have to virtually “turn off” these proteins&#8230;</strong><br />
And go directly to one key root cause of all that unwanted fat accumulating in your trouble areas.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>Support to ensure no more failed diets!!!</strong></em><br />
<em><strong>Get your hands on what researchers from some of the most prestigious schools in the world consider to be the most exciting biological hack in weight loss support history!</strong></em></p>

<h3></h3>
<h3>Start With Your Gut</h3>
<p><!-- instagram error: invalid instagram resource --></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">When it comes to getting ripped six pack abs, there’s one thing you should not overlook. Diet. So before you try this workout, if you’re not sure <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/healthy-eating-mistakes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">what you should be eating</a> in order to really chisel your abs, take my free body type quiz to learn the 3 most important things to do to see results.</span></p>
<div>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://vshred.com/sp/survey/survey-aka1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="s1">Click Here To Take The Free Body Type Quiz!</span></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Once your <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/healthy-eating-mistakes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">dietary concerns</a> are out of the way, it’s time to train those abs! Abs are just like any other muscle group, but smaller than most. That means you need to train them and let them recover just like any other muscle. So we recommend doing this weighted ab workout no more than every other day making sure to allow your abdominal muscles to recover completely.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">All you will need for this workout is a single dumbbell. You may pick the weight of your choice or use no weight at all (this depends on your physical capability) and do as follows:</span></p>
<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1">The Workout</span></h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There are four total exercises and for each exercise, you will do 4 sets of 10-15 reps with only 20 seconds of rest in-between. If you cannot handle this layout, you may extend your rest period slightly or break the sets into “mini sets” but make sure to complete the same total number of reps.</span></p>
<h3><span class="s1">Dumbbell Straight-Arm Crunches</span></h3>
<p><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/3ksxlaN8sLsKFMri0P"><img src="https://i0.wp.com/media.giphy.com/media/3ksxlaN8sLsKFMri0P/giphy.gif?resize=480%2C270&#038;ssl=1" alt="Animated GIF - Find &amp; Share on GIPHY" width="480" height="270" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In this abs routine, you’re going to lay flat on your back with your knees bent. Hold the dumbbell out straight above you and continue to push the dumbbell straight towards the ceiling as you crunch.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">4 sets of 10-15 reps. </span></p>
<h3><span class="s1">Dumbbell Reverse Crunches</span></h3>
<p><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/B1SY1kmjV1yVAJcbpJ"><img src="https://i2.wp.com/media.giphy.com/media/B1SY1kmjV1yVAJcbpJ/giphy.gif?resize=480%2C270&#038;ssl=1" alt="Animated GIF - Find &amp; Share on GIPHY" width="480" height="270" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Lay flat on your back again for this one but this time, place a dumbbell between your feet with your knees completely bent and thighs pointing straight up. Hold on to the dumbbell with your feet and bring your legs up toward your chest making sure your lower back gets off the ground. Focus on using your abs to pull your legs up and not getting momentum from your knees or feet. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">4 sets of 10-15 reps.</span></p>
<h3><span class="s1">Rotating Mountain Climbers</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For this one, get into a regular push-up position. Now, similar to mountain climbers, you will be driving your knees upward but will also do a twist as you do so. So you drive your knees to your opposite elbow as you twist your core.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">4 sets of 10-15 reps each way.</span></p>
<h3><span class="s1">Dumbbell Woodchops</span></h3>
<p><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/uANrWMqcPO9s62VFoZ"><img src="https://i0.wp.com/media.giphy.com/media/uANrWMqcPO9s62VFoZ/giphy.gif?resize=480%2C270&#038;ssl=1" alt="Animated GIF - Find &amp; Share on GIPHY" width="480" height="270" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Stand with a single dumbbell held by both hands and start off by turning your shoulders completely to one side, keeping the dumbbell low. Rotate your shoulders to the opposite side as you raise the dumbbell up high above your head in the process. Focus on engaging your core with the twists.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">4 sets of 10-15 each way.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">These core exercises, </span>as well as other <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/workout-plans-weight-loss/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">fat burning workouts</a>,<span style="font-size: 1rem;">will h</span>elp you get six pack abs and lead a healthier, more active life.</p>

<h2>17 Effective Tips to Get Rid of Belly Fat Fast</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>1. Do More HIIT Exercises</h3>
<p><!-- instagram error: invalid instagram resource --></p>
<p>Does running burn belly fat? The answer: yes. Running and other cardiovascular activities are great exercises to burn belly fat.</p>
<p>One of the best ways how to burn belly fat is to incorporate some cardio routines into your workout plan. But keep in mind not every cardio movement is ideal for bodybuilding purposes.</p>
<p>Instead of running 5 km/h on a treadmill, opt to do quick, explosive sprints. High-intensity interval exercises tend to burn both fat and muscle mass.</p>
<p>If you want to maintain a fit, strong, and sexy body, you need to do quick, explosive <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/hiit-workout-plan-burn-calories-in-4-minutes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HIIT workouts</a> that burn stubborn belly fat and build lean muscle mass at the same time.</p>
<h3>2. Ditch the Junk</h3>
<p>Potato chips, fries, chocolate bars, and fizzy drinks are just some of the junk you need to cut out from your diet if you want to burn belly fat fast.</p>
<p>These junk foods are high in calories and offer zero nutritional value. There’s no way to reduce belly fat without at least cutting back on these junk.</p>
<p>But if you can’t completely remove these foods from your diet, don’t worry! The next best way to lose stomach fat is to replace these snacks with healthier options.</p>
<p>For example, instead of eating a bag of potato crisps, make your own zucchini chips instead. Search for healthy food options you can use to replace your common daily snacks.</p>
<h3>3. Drink More Water</h3>
<p>Whether your goal is to lose belly fat, build muscle, or improve athletic strength, it’s very important to stay hydrated 24/7.</p>
<p>Drinking water is a solid way to remove toxins from your body. If these toxins pile up in your body, losing belly fat will be the least of your problems.</p>
<p>Too many toxins in the body may lead to constipation, bloating, and even certain diseases. Aim to drink 8 to 10 glasses of water for optimal performance.</p>
<h3>4. Make Healthier Food Choices</h3>
<p>Doing the best exercises to burn belly fat is not enough to trim down your waistline. Remember: you sculpt muscles in the gym and lose fat in the kitchen.</p>
<p>The best way to burn belly fat is to combine regular core exercises with a healthy, well-balanced diet. All your hard work at the gym won’t mean anything if you don’t feed your muscles with the right nutrients.</p>
<p>Some of the foods that burn belly fat include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Almonds</li>
<li>Berries</li>
<li>Fatty Fish</li>
<li>Eggs</li>
<li>Chili Peppers</li>
<li>Veggies</li>
<li>Oranges</li>
<li>Avocado</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> These are just some of the belly-fat-burners men and women can eat. Feel free to explore other natural food choices. Overall, it’s best to avoid artificially sourced snacks and foods. Stick to natural, healthy, and nutritious options.</p>
<h3>5. Cut Back on Carbs</h3>
<p>Many seasoned fitness buffs swear that the best way to burn belly fat is to cut back on carbs –and it’s true!</p>
<p>The body only burns about 6% to 8% of calories per gram of carbs. Meanwhile, the body burns 25% to 30% of calories per gram of protein.</p>
<p>That means you cut back on around 41 grams of calories if you eat 50 grams of protein instead of carbs. Keep this in mind while you’re making your personal diet plan to follow.</p>
<p>Opt to source your energy from alternative nutrients such as healthy fats, minerals, and of course, protein.</p>
<p><strong>Important:</strong> You don&#8217;t have to completely cut carbs from your diet. In fact, you need to know the best times of the day to <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/best-times-eat-carbs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">eat your carbs</a>.</p>
<h3>6. Start Meal Prepping</h3>
<p><!-- instagram error: invalid instagram resource --></p>
<p>One reason people forego eating healthy is because organic products usually cost more than artificially sourced foods do. That’s because organic food choices have a much shorter shelf life.</p>
<p>As a result, companies can’t produce too much stock since a lot of it might simply go to waste. However, there is a way to eat healthy, natural choices without denting your pocket: <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/how-to-meal-prep-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">meal prepping</a>.</p>
<p>It’s the best way to lose belly fat through healthy dieting without spending too much money on natural and organic food brands. The main point is to prepare your meals hours or even days ahead of time.</p>
<p>Do your grocery shopping, set aside a few hours to cook your meals, and then refrigerate them. This’ll also force you to forego eating junk food since you already have your packed meals with you.</p>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> Don’t worry if you don’t have a knack for cooking. Opt to follow V Shred’s <a href="https://vshred.com/sp/recipe-guide/v1/?ref=programs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">healthy recipe guide</a>. It consists of multiple delicious, healthy, easy-to-follow recipes any fitness buff can follow.</p>
<h3>7. Lay Off the Booze</h3>
<p>It’s no secret that an effective way how to burn belly fat for men and women is to cut back on alcoholic drinks.</p>
<p>A single bottle of beer already has around 150 calories. Count how many bottles you chug on a typical Friday night and multiply it by 150; that’s how many calories you consume during a night out.</p>
<p>You don’t have to completely abstain from booze. In fact, some studies suggest that a few occasional drinks may even be good for the health.</p>
<p>But what you should do is stop binge drinking every single weekend. It adds inches to your waist and kills your gains.</p>
<h3>8. Ditch the Salad Dressing</h3>
<p>Plenty of fitness buffs who want to get rid of belly fat choose to eat salads. But keep in mind that this healthy choice means nothing if you’re topping it with calorie-filled pre-packaged salad dressings.</p>
<p>The best way how to lose belly fat fast with salads is to top it off with vinaigrette dressing instead. Apart from having lesser calories, acidic fluids stimulate the fat-burning process.</p>
<p>Plus, they help remove water weight, constipation, and bloating. If you want to achieve a lean, shredded six-pack try to include vinegar into your diet.</p>
<h3>9. Start Keeping Track of Your Calories</h3>
<p>We cannot stress how important it is to keep track of your calories when dieting. To lose some pounds, you need to start calculating exactly how much you eat.</p>
<p>If you want to get rid of belly fat fast, you have to decrease your daily calorie intake. At the same time, you need to increase the number of calories you burn every day.</p>
<p>The average male needs to eat 1,500 calories if they want to drop their body fat percentage. Meanwhile, women can only consume 1,000 calories per day if they want to trim a few inches off their waist.</p>
<h3>10. Do Various Abdominal Exercises</h3>
<p>Crunches are good ab exercises, but they’re not the only workouts you need to do. Your ab-sculpting regimen should consist of different moves that hit your torso from all different angles.</p>
<p>Try to incorporate exercises that hit your lower, middle, and upper abs respectively. For example, if you’re looking for moves on how to lose fat in your<a href="https://vshred.com/blog/how-to-lose-lower-belly-fat/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> lower abs</a>, you can opt to bust out some hanging leg raises.</p>
<p>Overall, what’s important is to create a complete abs workout with different moves and exercises to sculpt your torso from all angles.</p>
<h3>11. Start Lifting Weights</h3>
<p>Running on your gym’s treadmill for hours on end is not the best way how to burn belly fat. If you want to sculpt a strong, solid core, you need to start doing some resistance training.</p>
<p>It’s very important to include <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/strength-training/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">compound strength-training moves</a> such as the bench press, deadlift, and squat into your regimen.</p>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> Even if your main goal is to get rid of belly fat, it’s not practical to do ab exercises every single day of the week. Like any other muscle group, you only need to work your abs out around two to three times a week.</p>
<h3>12. Lower Your Stress Levels</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-5445 size-full" src="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/man-doing-yoga-on-mat-near-glass-balcony-fence-get-rid-of-belly-fat-px.jpg?resize=625%2C400&#038;ssl=1" alt="Lower Your Stress Levels | The Most Effective Ways to Get Rid of Belly Fat Fast" width="625" height="400" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/man-doing-yoga-on-mat-near-glass-balcony-fence-get-rid-of-belly-fat-px.jpg?w=625&amp;ssl=1 625w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/man-doing-yoga-on-mat-near-glass-balcony-fence-get-rid-of-belly-fat-px.jpg?resize=300%2C192&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>If you want to get rid of belly fat, make sure to be mindful of the stress you put on yourself.</p>
<p>You may not notice it, but stress has a negative effect on both your mind and body. Apart from the strain it places on your mental health, it also promotes the production of the stress hormone, cortisol.</p>
<p>High cortisol levels tend to increase your appetite and stimulate the storage of fat in your abdomen. Women should especially be careful of their stress levels since they already have high amounts of cortisol.</p>
<p>To reduce your stress, try engaging in mentally and spiritually relaxing activities such as yoga, stretching, and meditation. Doing these simple, short activities are a great way to lower your stress levels.</p>
<h3>13. Move Around More Often</h3>
<p>Simple movements such as taking the stairs, walking around the office, and stretching every few hours can go a long way in helping you get rid of belly fat.</p>
<p>Sedentary people tend to accumulate more fat in their belly. Plus, their muscles don’t get sufficient blood and oxygen to recover properly.</p>
<p>What you can do is to stand up from your desk for a few minutes after every couple of hours of work. If you have the time, you can try to squeeze in some <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/abs-workout-home/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">quick abdominal workouts</a> during your lunch break.</p>
<p>Remember: the key here is to get the blood flowing and muscles moving as much as you can. It doesn’t matter when or where.</p>
<h3>14. Start Keeping Track of Your Record</h3>
<p>A solid way how to lose belly fat is to force yourself beyond your comfort zone. You can do this by keeping track of your personal record when performing different exercises to burn belly fat.</p>
<p>For example, if you usually cover five kilometers in 30 minutes, try to ramp it up by challenging yourself to cover the same distance faster. Similarly, you can opt to increase the reps of your burpees, crunches, or sit-ups every month or so.</p>
<p>This is effective because the body naturally adapts to the level of stress we put on it. After a few weeks, it won’t be as difficult to bust out 20 burpees anymore.</p>
<p>Variation ensures your body doesn’t adapt too quickly to the exercises you regularly perform. This means you’re constantly challenging your body to work harder and stronger every time you work out.</p>
<h3>15. Do Resistance Training Before Cardio</h3>
<p>Many fitness buffs struggle whether they should perform cardio before or after a workout. If your goal is to get rid of belly fat fast, then opt to perform it after you do resistance training.</p>
<p>This’ll help you focus all your strength on lifting more sets of heavy weights. At the same time, your body will have a harder time doing your cardio routine since you’re already tired.</p>
<p>Doing so will force your body to work twice as hard during your cardio session even if you’re doing your regular routine.</p>
<h3>16. Follow a Scientifically Proven Plan</h3>
<p>Remember that there’s no one-size-fits-all plan on how to <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/get-six-pack/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reduce belly fat</a>.</p>
<p>You can opt to create your own abs regimen by gathering the different core exercises online. Similarly, you can subscribe to a brand that offers a fitness plan consisting of the most effective tips and exercises on how to lose stomach fat.</p>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> If you want to know the secret how to burn belly fat fast, get V Shred’s <a href="https://vshred.com/sp/six-pack-shred/v1/?ref=programs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Six-Pack Shred</a> program. It’s a scientifically proven fitness plan that helps dedicated gym-goers sculpt a strong, shredded six-pack in just a few weeks.</p>
<h3>17. Just Do It</h3>
<p><!-- instagram error: invalid instagram resource --></p>
<p>The only way to lose belly fat is to get off your ass and just do it! But don’t pressure yourself into making any large, life-changing decisions you’re not ready for.</p>
<p>What’s important is to push yourself to take the first step –no matter how small it is. Whether it’s a gym membership, fitness plan subscription, or healthier meal plan, what matters is you took the initiative to achieve your goal.</p>

<h2>Best Way to Get Rid of Belly Fat | 10 Foods to Avoid</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>1. Full-Fat Dairy Products</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-4402 size-full" src="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/selective-focus-photo-of-cheese-best-way-to-get-rid-of-belly-fat-px.jpg?resize=625%2C400&#038;ssl=1" alt="Full-Fat Dairy Products | Foods to Avoid for a Flat Stomach |best way to get rid of belly fat" width="625" height="400" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/selective-focus-photo-of-cheese-best-way-to-get-rid-of-belly-fat-px.jpg?w=625&amp;ssl=1 625w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/selective-focus-photo-of-cheese-best-way-to-get-rid-of-belly-fat-px.jpg?resize=300%2C192&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>Full-fat dairy products are very high in calories and saturated fat. Be careful when buying products such as cheese, milk, and yogurt.</p>
<p>The next time you go shopping for dairy products, choose low-fat items instead. Additionally, opt to get your calcium from green leafy vegetables instead of full-fat dairy goods.</p>
<h3>2. Refined Carbohydrates</h3>
<p>A good way to get<a href="https://vshred.com/blog/how-to-get-a-flat-stomach/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> rid of belly fat</a> is to avoid foods with refined carbs, also known as &#8220;simple&#8221; carbs. They promote inflammation and weight gain. Plus, refined carbs spike your sugar levels.</p>
<p>Replace these foods with whole-grain, fiber-enriched foods instead, also known as &#8220;complex&#8221; carbs.</p>
<h3>3. Fried Foods</h3>

<p>One way to lose belly fat naturally is to avoid frying your food using cooking oil.</p>
<p>Due to its high-fat content, it takes much longer to digest these types of food. Plus, excessive amounts can lead to digestive tract complications such as acid reflux and heartburn.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re able to, choose to bake your meals instead of frying them. Switching to olive, coconut, or avocado oil will allow you to increase the amount of polyunsaturated and monounsaturated (healthy) fats in your diet while limiting the amount of saturated and trans fats in your diet.</p>
<h3>4. Candy and Soda</h3>
<p>These sugar-filled treats are full of empty calories. They offer no nutritional value so the body stores them as fat.</p>
<p>If you’re a fan of diet sodas, you might want to reconsider your choice of drink. It’s no healthier than regular soda and only increases your cravings for sweets.</p>
<p>To satisfy your sweet tooth, drink a glass of fruit-infused water instead. Add some slices of lemons and cucumbers for a cool, refreshing, and healthy alternative to soda and sweets.</p>
<h3>5. Alcohol</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-4404 size-full" src="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/clear-drinking-glass-best-way-to-get-rid-of-belly-fat-px.jpg?resize=625%2C400&#038;ssl=1" alt="Alcohol | Foods to Avoid for a Flat Stomach | best way to get rid of belly fat" width="625" height="400" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/clear-drinking-glass-best-way-to-get-rid-of-belly-fat-px.jpg?w=625&amp;ssl=1 625w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/clear-drinking-glass-best-way-to-get-rid-of-belly-fat-px.jpg?resize=300%2C192&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>If you really want to lose stubborn belly fat fast, then you need to avoid alcoholic drinks.</p>
<p>Similar to sodas, they’re filled with empty calories that offer zero nutritional value. Plus, it slows down your body’s fat-burning process.</p>
<p>If you’re going to drink alcohol, choose beverages with lower calories such as wine. Also, remember to drink water in between shots to prevent over-consumption. It’s also a great way to avoid a painful hangover.</p>
<h3>6. Salted Snacks</h3>
<p>To rid your body of fat, you need to avoid salted snacks such as potato chips. Salt retains water which makes you feel bloated and gain weight.</p>
<p>Choose <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/healthy-snacking-snack-options/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">healthier snacks</a> such as nuts, veggie slices, and whole grain crackers instead.</p>
<h3>7. Natural and Artificial Sweeteners</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-4405 size-full" src="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/beverages-cold-colourful-best-way-to-get-rid-of-belly-fat-px.jpg?resize=625%2C400&#038;ssl=1" alt="Natural and Artificial Sweeteners | Foods to Avoid for a Flat Stomach | best way to get rid of belly fat" width="625" height="400" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/beverages-cold-colourful-best-way-to-get-rid-of-belly-fat-px.jpg?w=625&amp;ssl=1 625w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/beverages-cold-colourful-best-way-to-get-rid-of-belly-fat-px.jpg?resize=300%2C192&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>Avoid processed foods with artificial sugars and high-fructose corn syrup. Similarly, fruit juices contain massive amounts of calories that may end up being stored as belly fat.</p>
<p>The best thing to do is to eliminate all processed foods from your diet. Then, instead of drinking fruit drinks, eat the fruits whole and fresh. Also, it’s best to juice vegetables for a refreshing, healthy drink.</p>
<h3>8. Diet Foods</h3>
<p>One of the best tips for losing belly fat is to steer clear of diet foods. Diet meals and shakes may contain heaps of sodium and preservatives. Also, some protein bars have a higher calorie-content than chocolate bars. If you&#8217;re going to consume protein bars, look for protein bars with less than 6 grams of sugar.</p>
<p>One of the best ways to lose belly fat is to make your own diet meals and protein bars instead. Choose all-natural ingredients brimming with vitamins and nutrients.</p>
<h3>9. Processed Meat</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-4406 size-full" src="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/grilling-sausages-best-way-to-get-rid-of-belly-fat-px.jpg?resize=625%2C400&#038;ssl=1" alt="Processed Meat | Foods to Avoid for a Flat Stomach | best way to get rid of belly fat" width="625" height="400" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/grilling-sausages-best-way-to-get-rid-of-belly-fat-px.jpg?w=625&amp;ssl=1 625w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/grilling-sausages-best-way-to-get-rid-of-belly-fat-px.jpg?resize=300%2C192&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>Processed meats such as bacon, cold cuts, and hotdogs have high levels of saturated fats and calories. Excessive consumption might put you at risk of heart disease and stroke.</p>
<p>Ditch the processed foods and switch to fresh meat instead. But keep in mind that you should also observe moderation when eating fresh meat.</p>
<h3>10. Pre-Packaged Salads</h3>
<p>While vegetables are healthy, the dressings that come with pre-packaged salads are high in trans fat and calories. The same goes for sides such as cheese and croutons.</p>
<p>If you want to achieve a shredded physique, drop the salad dressings. Make your own using lemon juice, non-fat yogurt, and vinaigrette instead.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Would you rather lose weight or get shredded? When looking for weight-loss diet plans for men, you should always go for the programs that still sustain muscle definition. Check out these best fat-loss diets for men.</p>
<h2>Top Fat-Burning, Muscle-Building Diet Plans for Men</h2>
<h3><span style="color: #000080;">1. Custom Diet and Training Plan for Him by V Shred</span></h3>
<p><!-- instagram error: invalid instagram resource --></p>
<p>The <a href="https://vshred.com/programs/custom-training-and-diet-plan-8-week" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Custom Diet and Training Plan for Him</a> by V Shred offers an all-in-one solution for men who are trying to lose weight and build lean muscle. V Shred customizes the plan according to your individual needs.</p>
<p>How? We take into account your body type, fitness goals, and athleticism, among other factors, to create the best shredding program for men. It&#8217;s like having a personal trainer for less.</p>
<p><strong>Trivia</strong>: Do you know professional athletes, models, and actors pay for their fitness coaches around $10,000 monthly on average?</p>
<h3><span style="color: #000080;">2. Atkins Diet</span></h3>
<p>The Atkins Diet is a popular low-carb weight-loss program. The idea behind this fat-burner diet plan for men is that you should consume few to zero carbs while dieting. You get most of your energy from <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/high-protein-diet-plans/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">protein and healthy fats</a>.</p>
<p>However, remember that too much fat and protein may have negative effects on you if you’re prone to heart disease.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #000080;">3. Time-Restricted Intermittent Fasting</span></h3>
<p>Time-restricted intermittent fasting is a diet plan that restricts your calorie consumption for a specific period of time. Depending on the person, your fasting time can range anywhere from 4 to 12 hours.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that almost all calorie-cutting diet plans for men will make you lose at least a few pounds of muscle. Time-restricted intermittent fasting won&#8217;t help you build muscle fast but there are plenty of ways to still grow muscle during the process.</p>
<p>Scheduling your meals accordingly and continuous muscle-building workouts help counteract muscle reduction while on this diet.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #000080;">4. Low-Calorie Diet</span></h3>
<p><!-- instagram error: invalid instagram resource --></p>
<p>This diet meal plan decreases the number of calories you consume in a day. The average man&#8217;s calorie consumption goes down from 2,000-2,500 calories per day to 800-1,200 calories.</p>
<p>When on this diet, make sure you still consume enough protein to support muscle growth. Around one gram of protein per pound of body weight is enough to keep your muscles from shrinking despite low-calorie intake.</p>
<p>Some examples of food that are good for this diet are tomatoes, celery, carrots, apples, and nuts. Add some beef, chicken breast, and eggs for your protein intake.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #000080;">5. Paleo Diet</span></h3>
<p>Plenty of people blame junk foods and fast food restaurants for obesity because of all the chemicals and additives in their products. Fitness buffs who want to lessen their consumption of additives and chemicals created the Paleo diet.</p>
<p>The theory behind this is to only eat foods you would get by hunting or fishing, just like our forefathers did in the Paleolithic era. It’s one of the simplest and most affordable diet plans for men on this list.</p>
<p>Consuming these food types allows you to get the nutrients you need to grow your muscles minus the unnecessary calories.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #000080;">6. The 5:2 Diet</span></h3>
<p>The 5:2 diet is currently the most popular subcategory of intermittent fasting. Instead of fasting for hours, here, you fast for days. You should only use this diet plan if you want to lose fat fast.</p>
<p>While it may not be able to sustain muscle growth, you can still offset your muscle-loss by doing specific exercises. For example, you can avoid cardio workouts and focus on heavy muscle-building workouts.</p>
<p><strong>Pro tips:</strong> Remember that you should not do this type of fasting for more than a few months. We strongly recommend consulting with your physician before deciding to try this type of diet plan for men.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #000080;">7. The Zone Diet</span></h3>
<p>The Zone Diet is basically a balanced program consisting of carbs, protein, fats, and other nutrients. Everything is fair game provided they are consumed in moderation.</p>
<p>This is great for weight loss because unlike other diet plans for men, the Zone Diet is a bit more flexible. You can freely add in the macros you need to promote muscle growth.</p>
<p>Remember: the key to sustaining muscle development despite trying to lose weight is to consume the right nutrients.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Check out the top three lies about diet plans for men:</strong></p>

<p>When trying out diet plans for men, it’s always best to consult with your physician first. Try to avoid certain meal plans that may have adverse effects on you.</p>
<p>That’s why it’s always best to go with a customized <a href="https://vshred.com/programs/custom-training-and-diet-plan-8-week" target="_blank" rel="noopener">meal plan</a> tailored to suit your needs, goals, and current level of athleticism. At the end of the day, the important thing is to create a healthy balance <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/why-not-losing-weight/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">between exercise</a>, diet, and supplementation.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Do you want to know how to lose lower belly fat?</p>
<p>This can be a challenge even for the most athletic bodies. This fat forms between the organs, deep in the abdominal cavity. The body tends to naturally put on weight here for various reasons including stress and child-bearing. These factors makes it one of the last areas to burn off fat in the body.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re looking for a flatter stomach, a lower body fat percentage, and a healthier overall wellbeing, we have the right guide for you. The right diet and exercises are key. Keep reading to learn how to lose your FUPA.</p>

<h2>How to Lose Lower Belly Fat</h2>
<div id="diet"></div>
<h3>Diet to Lose Belly Fat</h3>
<p><!-- instagram error: invalid instagram resource --></p>
<p>You can go on a variety of diets that are designed to help you lose fat, but unfortunately, you can&#8217;t necessarily choose where you want to lose the fat. Genetics plays a big role in that process. Luckily, however, there are a few things that you can do to encourage <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/how-to-get-a-flat-stomach/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">fat loss in that area</a>.</p>
<p>In particular, try to reduce your sugar intake. Numerous studies indicate that excess sugar leads to a buildup of fat around the belly and liver areas.</p>
<p>Additionally, sugar causes metabolic problems, meaning that it reduces your chances of losing weight. Sugary drinks are the worst culprit because your body doesn&#8217;t really know what to do with liquid sugar.</p>
<p>Also, try to increase the amount of protein in your diet. Healthy proteins can boost your metabolism and reduce your cravings. In fact, in one study, researchers found that people who eat healthy protein are less likely to have a lot of belly fat. Ideally, you want to focus on foods that have 25 to 30% of their calories from protein.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that, sometimes, lower belly fat is built up waste and bloating. The best way to reduce that is by consuming more soluble dietary fiber, and foods that reduce bloat. You might even want to take a fiber supplement. Be sure to drink plenty of water to help flush your body of waste.</p>

<h3>The Belly Fat Workout</h3>
<p><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/1k04eM27fKd0aebFZJ"><img src="https://i1.wp.com/media2.giphy.com/media/1k04eM27fKd0aebFZJ/giphy.gif?resize=480%2C270&#038;ssl=1" alt="Animated GIF - Find &amp; Share on GIPHY" width="480" height="270" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>To tighten your abs and help get rid of<span> a </span><span class="scayt-misspell-word" data-scayt-word="FUPA" data-wsc-lang="en_US">FUPA</span>, you need a workout that&#8217;s designed to target your middle. Check out these exercises:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Roll Up</strong> — With this modified sit up, you lie on the ground with your legs straight. Then, you extend your arms behind your head just until your torso starts to lift off the ground. Finally, you slowly sit up, let your arms rise above your head, and roll forward until your hands are touching your toes. Repeat, but keep your reps slow and steady so that you can feel your abdominal muscles contracting.</li>
<li><strong>Straight Leg Raise</strong> — Again, lie on your back with your legs straight in front of you. Then, place your hands under your bum with your palms on the floor to stabilize yourself. Use your abdominal muscles to lift your legs up toward the ceiling until they are at a right angle with your body. Slowly lower your legs back to the floor. Make sure your lower back is pressed firmly to the floor and repeat.</li>
<li><strong>Hip Lift</strong> — To do a hip lift, start with your back on the ground and your knees bent. Then, pull your abs in and lift your pelvis toward the ceiling. When your pelvis is raised, your body should be supported by your feet and shoulders.</li>
<li><strong>Reverse Crunches</strong> — <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/best-ab-workout-plan-for-beginners-only-4-minutes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">With reverse crunches,</a> you pull your legs toward your abdomen. Again, start by lying on the ground with your knees bent at a 90-degree angle. Then, contract your abs and pull your knees toward your chest.</li>
<li><strong>Flutter Kicks</strong> — Lie on your back with your legs stretched out in front of you. Then, raise your head and shoulders off the floor. Put your hands behind your head for neck support if needed. Then, slowly lift both legs a few inches off the floor. Raise your right leg so that it&#8217;s closer to the ceiling. Then, switch so that your left leg is closer to the ceiling. Repeat, using slow and steady motions.</li>
<li><strong>Double Leg Circles</strong> — From the same position you did your flutter kicks, you should also try double leg circles. This time, just lift one leg off the floor and rotate it in a circle. Don&#8217;t just move your ankle. Make sure that you are moving your entire foot in a circle. Then repeat with the other leg. To get maximum impact on your abdominal muscles, make sure that you keep the small of your back against the floor.</li>
<li><strong>V-Sits</strong> — Start by lying on the ground with your legs stretched out in front of you and your arms over your head. Then, pull your legs upward while also sitting up. Ultimately, your legs and upper body should form a v-shape, and your arms should be parallel with your legs for balance. Bring your arms toward your legs and tighten the v-shape a bit. Finally, bring your arms down so that they are near the floor, and then, repeat the motion.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Exercises for Separated Abdominal Muscles</h3>

<p>A lot of moms struggle with lower belly fat. Sometimes after they have a baby, their abdominal muscles separate, this is called diastasis recti.</p>
<p>Ideally, your abdominal muscles should be next to each other, lined up vertically on either side of your belly button. However, after carrying a baby, these muscles often shift apart from each other. At the same time, your weakened core can lead to back pain.</p>
<p>Research shows that women can lose 2 inches off their waists within three weeks using the right exercises. You shouldn&#8217;t do crossover crunches or bicycle crunches. Both of those exercises can splay the abs further apart. Instead, you should try an exercise program designed to help diastasis recti.</p>
<p>Basically, these exercises involve sitting on the floor cross-legged. Then, you place your hands on your belly, take a deep breath, and allow everything to expand. As you exhale, pull in your abdominal muscles toward your spine and hold them.</p>
<p>Continue to take tiny breaths and as you exhale, pull your stomach back further and further. Do these exercises for 10 minutes a day for 12 weeks, and your separated abdominal muscles should come back together.</p>

<h3>The Right Posture</h3>
<p><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/eexyLiY5jaQNWjHNTp"><img src="https://i1.wp.com/media0.giphy.com/media/eexyLiY5jaQNWjHNTp/giphy.gif?resize=480%2C270&#038;ssl=1" alt="Animated GIF - Find &amp; Share on GIPHY" width="480" height="270" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>Sometimes, your posture can exacerbate the look of belly fat. If your pelvis is tilted too far forward, that can make you look shorter and your lower belly look bigger.</p>
<p>To address anterior pelvic tilt, try strengthening your glutes and try lying on your back with your knees bent. Then, push your lower back into the ground. As you get used to the feeling of your pelvis in a neutral or posterior position, you can try standing pelvic tilt exercises and planks.</p>
<p>To ensure you&#8217;re getting into the right alignment with these exercises, you may want to work with a personal yoga trainer. Even just an hour or two with a personal trainer can be ideal. They can really help to put you on the right path.</p>
<p>In general, any workouts that focus on your core such as<span> </span><span class="scayt-misspell-word" data-scayt-word="pilates" data-wsc-lang="en_US">pilates</span><span> </span>and yoga can help to improve your posture, while also making your body stronger and leaner. If you struggle from excessive anterior pelvic tilt, you may want to contact a chiropractor for help.</p>

<h3>Relax</h3>
<p><!-- instagram error: invalid instagram resource --></p>
<p>Relaxing is easier said than done, but it&#8217;s essential if you want to lose lower belly fat. Stress increases cortisol levels. That reduces your metabolism in general, but it also encourages your body to store fat in the lower belly area in particular.</p>
<p>To minimize stress from a dietary perspective, focus on whole grains. When you eat carbs, your body releases serotonin. This happiness hormone helps to alleviate the stress you feel.</p>
<p>However, if you eat simple carbs such as sugar and white flour, you&#8217;re likely to get a burst of feel-good hormones followed by a drop in your mood. This is in contrast with whole grains, where you get a steady release of serotonin.</p>
<p>Additionally, add more avocados, almonds, and blueberries to your diet. Food with magnesium also helps to keep cortisol low. Moreover, if you treat yourself to an<span> </span><span class="scayt-misspell-word" data-scayt-word="epsom" data-wsc-lang="en_US">Epsom</span><span> </span>salts bath, you get to absorb magnesium through your skin while also enjoying a nice soak. That detoxifies and relaxes you at the same time.</p>
<p>Beyond dietary measures, find other ways to reduce the stress in your life if possible. Exercise can help to reduce stress. You also may want to try supplements.</p>
<p>Lemon balm, omega-3 fatty acids, valerian root, and a variety of other ingredients can all be helpful. Most importantly, try to find activities that you enjoy.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re trying to cut back on things that make you feel stressed, try to substitute stressful activities with a feel-good hobby. For instance, if you notice feeling stressed after checking social media, you might want to try texting a friend, reading a chapter of a book, watching a funny video, or doing something else you find fun.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Many people wonder how to get a flat stomach. After all, when it comes to how you feel about your body, excess belly fat is a major annoyance.</p>
<p>Most people can deal with a larger-than-average bottom, a bigger chest, or even some affectionate arm jiggle. But if you have extra fat around your midsection, fitting into those skinny jeans or feeling sexy on the beach will be a bit tough.</p>
<p>In this guide, we’ll discuss what you need to know about getting a flat tummy. Most of your efforts should be placed on diet and exercise. While there is no magic pill, following the guidelines here will put you on the right path to a flatter stomach in no time!</p>
<h2>Learn How to Get a Flat Stomach Now</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong><span style="color: #000080;">Part 1: Taking Control of Your Diet</span></strong></h3>
<p>Some individuals who are reading this won’t need to lose that much weight and, for the most part, they will only be looking for ways to help define their abs. But if you have excess fat, you’ll need weight loss strategies to get a flat stomach. Follow these guidelines.</p>
<h3>Start Tracking Your Diet</h3>
<p><!-- instagram error: invalid instagram resource --></p>
<p>If you’ve never tracked your diet before, now is the time to start. Begin by getting a small journal and keeping it with you at all times. This will be your food diary, and in it, you will begin tracking everything you eat.</p>
<p>You can start by simply tracking your food and calculating your calories. Use online calorie counters or buy a pocket calorie book to find out the calorie counts of your favorite foods. Simply track to start, and don’t change what you do.</p>
<h3>Set a Caloric Intake Goal</h3>
<p>Now, you will need to start limiting your calories. If you have excess weight on your body, it’s probably because you’ve been eating too many calories and not exercising them off.</p>
<p>A pound of fat is equal to 3500 calories. Therefore, to lose one pound each week, you need to create a calorie deficit of 3500 calories each week (or 500 calories each day). Figure out how much you eat on average, then lower that amount by 3500 calories each week. That’s your calorie goal.</p>
<h3>Plan Your Meals</h3>
<p><!-- instagram error: invalid instagram resource --></p>
<p>To help you eat less, you’ll need to <em>change </em>the way you eat as well. This means a lot of planning.</p>
<p>Your goal should be to consume more fruits, veggies, healthy fats (olive oil, avocados), and lean protein (fish, chicken, turkey) and less processed fats, refined carbs, and sugar. This starts with not buying these unhealthy foods in the first place and stocking your fridge with healthy alternatives.</p>
<p>You’ll need to start planning what you eat – especially if you don’t have a lot of time. Make your lunch the night before, purchase pre-made salads or ready-made chicken to add to salads and stir-fries, and always have cut fruits and veggies in your fridge.</p>
<h3>Track Your Progress</h3>
<p>To avoid weight gain, make sure you are taking your measurements and tracking your progress. You must weigh and measure yourself once per week. Do not do this more than once per week because slight fluctuations may cause you to gain small amounts of weight before ultimately dropping pounds. Weighing and measuring yourself every day and expecting results will only make you lose motivation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong><span style="color: #000080;">Part 2: Belly Fat Burning Exercises</span></strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://vshred.com/blog/30-day-workout-challenge/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Getting into an exercise regimen</a> that works for you is the best way to get a flat stomach. In other words, not all exercise plans will work for everyone.</p>
<p>Fortunately, you will have a lot of leeway, but as a general rule, you have to mix <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/best-ab-workout-plan-for-beginners-only-4-minutes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ab exercises</a> with cardiovascular exercise. Let’s go over each of these workout types:</p>
<h3>Muscle-Building Exercises</h3>
<p><!-- instagram error: invalid instagram resource --></p>
<p>Having a flatter, more defined stomach is about two things. First, if you have too much weight around your belly, you need to remove this excess fat so that your abs can — first and foremost — be seen. Do this with diet changes and cardio.</p>
<p>Next, you need to better <em>define </em>those muscles that make up your abs. This is where <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/free-full-6-pack-abs-workout-video/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tummy-targeting exercises</a> come in. Try these two for starters:</p>
<p><strong>1. Plank-Ups</strong></p>
<p>The plank position is ideal for shaping and defining your core (abs). The plank-up is a variation of the traditional plank.</p>
<p>Start by getting into a plank position on a floor mat. Make sure your hands are directly beneath your elbows and shoulders. Your back should be completely straight, and your head should be down.</p>
<p>Now, take the weight off of the right hand/arm and go down to your elbow. Do the same on the other side. Go back up to straight arm position on the right, and repeat on the left. That’s one move.</p>
<p>Do the move 10 times or as many times as you can.</p>
<p><strong>2. Bicycle</strong></p>
<p>Lie on your back on a floor mat, bend your knees, and bring your legs up so that your thighs are perpendicular to the floor and your shins are parallel with the floor. Put your hands behind your head and lace your fingers, elbows out.</p>
<p>Now, starting with the right side, tighten your tummy muscles, and bring your right elbow to your left knee. As you do so, straighten your right leg out in front of you without lowering it. Come back to the center position, then do the same thing on the opposite side. This is one move. Do it kind of like you are riding a bike.</p>
<p>Repeat the move 20 to 30 times.</p>
<h3>Cardio Exercise</h3>
<p><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/9DyNgzhCR2M4YDpv3Q"><img src="https://i0.wp.com/media.giphy.com/media/9DyNgzhCR2M4YDpv3Q/giphy.gif?resize=480%2C270&#038;ssl=1" alt="Animated GIF - Find &amp; Share on GIPHY" width="480" height="270" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>Now that you have some ab-defining exercises, to begin with, you’ll need to <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/best-cardio-workout-for-running-stairs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">get in some cardio</a>, too. Here’s where you’ll have the most flexibility.</p>
<p>For example, you can start by joining a sports club or an intramural team. Try a sport that <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/running-for-weight-loss/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">has you running and moving a lot,</a> like basketball, soccer, volleyball, or tennis.</p>
<p>If you’d rather do something less competitive, take an aerobics class. Alternatively, if you’d like to work out alone, swimming, biking, and running are always options.</p>
<p>Just make sure that you’re working up a sweat. It’s better to go hard for a short period of time than it is to slowly and easily exercise for a long time.</p>
<p>A great way to get in a quick and fat-burning workout on a treadmill or bike, for example, is to try<span> </span><span class="scayt-misspell-word" data-scayt-word="HIIT" data-wsc-lang="en_US">HIIT</span><span> </span>– high-intensity interval training. This is where you go hard (90% &#8211; 100%) for a minute or so, then slow it down to 30% &#8211; 40% for an equal amount of time.</p>
<p>You go back and forth like this 4 or 5 times, and that’s your workout!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong><span style="color: #000080;">Extra Tips to Aid Your Progress</span></strong></h3>
<p>Here are some other tips to keep in mind throughout the process of learning how to get a flat stomach:</p>
<h3>Master Self Motivation</h3>
<p><!-- instagram error: invalid instagram resource --></p>
<p>Getting fit and getting flat abs is certainly about what you eat and how you exercise, but it’s also about your mindset. You need to get your head on straight before you begin!</p>
<p>A good way to keep yourself motivated is to keep a journal. Write about <em>why </em>you want to get fitter and lose weight. Put up Post-it notes to remind you throughout the day, or set alarms on your phone.</p>
<p>You might also tell your friends what you are doing, and ask for their encouragement. Tell your family, too, as you all may be able to get fit together (who couldn’t use a flatter stomach!?).</p>
<h3>Know How to Dine Out</h3>
<p>One challenge that many people run into is eating out at restaurants or parties. Once you get to these places, all diet rules seem to go out the window!</p>
<p>To master eating out and eating at restaurants, remember that planning is everything. The best way to get through an event where there will be tempting foods is to plan ahead. For example, if you want to have a piece of cake, go for it, but forgo the daily granola bar snack. If you want to have a glass of wine, great. That’s okay, but eat less salad dressing at lunch.</p>
<p>Next, make sure that you know what will be on the menu. Check online for restaurant menus, or ask the party planner. Then, you can plan what you will have at the event and work it into your weekly food intake.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong><span style="color: #000080;">Fallen Off the Wagon? There’s No Time Like the Present to Start Again!</span></strong></h3>
<p>Going on a new diet for weight loss and starting a new exercise regimen to better define your abs is tough. This is why it is important to keep your head even if you don’t consistently hit your goals every day.</p>
<p>Many people wonder how to get a flat stomach. After all, when it comes to how you feel about your body, excess belly fat is a major annoyance.</p>

<p class="p1">There are a few major factors that help determine what the best workout to lose weight is for you.</p>
<p class="p1">While those determining factors may differ from person to person, hopefully this workout includes a couple benefits that you like.</p>

<h2 class="p1">The Best Workout to Lose Weight</h2>

<p class="p1">You will perform each exercise back to back until all 4 minutes are completed.</p>
<h3 class="p1">The Exercises</h3>
<h4 class="p1">Alternating Jumps with Reach</h4>

<p class="p1">Truth is, we’re all pressed for time. With all the different responsibilities you have, how are you supposed to workout for an hour or even more?</p>
<p class="p1">You don’t have to!</p>
<p class="p1">When you change your workout style, and start doing high intensity interval training, workouts become shorter and results happen faster.</p>
<p class="p1">This is only a 4 minute workout that will leave you gassed and will burn tons of calories!</p>
<p class="p1">Plus, you don’t need any weights or equipment, so you can do it anywhere, at any time. Try it out!</p>
<h2 class="p1">4 Minute Cardio Workout</h2>
<p class="p1">In this workout, I take you through a quick, but effective workout to target body fat all over!</p>
<p class="p1">It&#8217;s going to be 4 exercises done for 20 seconds on with a 10 second rest. Then you&#8217;ll repeat each exercise twice to equal the full 4 minutes.</p>
<h3 class="p1">The Exercises:</h3>
<h4 class="p1">Half Burpees</h4>
<p class="p1">For this exercise, you will start down on the ground on your hands and feet. From there, you will jump your feet backs if going down for a burpee. Then jump your feet forward towards your hands like you’re going to jump up for a burpee. But instead of jumping up, jump your feet back out and repeat as many times as you can for 20 seconds. Then rest for 10 seconds and move onto the next exercise.</p>
<h4 class="p1">Jump Squats</h4>
<p class="p1">Here, you will get into a squat position, with your feet at shoulder width. From there, you will squat down, and starting from the bottom, you will explode up into a jump. Then land and go right back into your next squat. Repeat as many jump squats as you can for 20 seconds. Then rest for another 10 seconds and move onto the next exercise.</p>
<h4 class="p1">Bicycles</h4>
<p class="p1">This is a great ab exercise where you will start by laying on your back with your hands on the back of your head. From there, you will bring one knee up as high as you can, while crunching up and bringing one elbow down to meet your knee. Then repeat to the other side and do as many times as you can for 20 seconds. After this, rest for 10 seconds and move into the fourth and final exercise.</p>
<h4 class="p1">Spider Man Pushups</h4>
<p class="p1">Here, you will be doing an advanced variation of a pushup. Starting in a pushup position, you will lower yourself to the floor as you bring your knee up and out to the side. Bring it as close to your elbow as possible. Then as you press yourself back up, return your foot back to the starting position. Then repeat to the other side and do this as many times as you can for 20 seconds. If you already struggle with push-ups, don’t worry about the crunch and just do push-ups.</p>
<p class="p1">After completing all four exercises, you will rest for 10 seconds then repeat this cycle one more time.</p>
