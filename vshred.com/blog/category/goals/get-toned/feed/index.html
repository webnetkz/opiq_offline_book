That is a scary number!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Good thing you found this article because </span><b><i>we aren’t going to let YOU be “most” people! </i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lower temps do not have to equal larger waistlines! You just have to have a plan! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this short read we will &#8230;</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Explain why winter weight gain happens. Knowing why is important if you want to prevent it and the reason is probably not what you think. In fact, it is partially not even your fault!</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tell you why fall/winter is actually the BEST time to start a diet and training plan.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Give you 7 easy pro tips that will help guide you through the next few months. </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You may believe winter weight gain happens because of the holidays. Those extra home cooked meals and holiday parties are certainly a factor. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But </span><b><i>there is a DAILY issue you need to be prepared to fight </i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">if you want to avoid packing on winter pounds.</span></p>
<p><b>WHY YOU REALLY PACK ON POUNDS AFTER LABOR DAY</b></p>
<p><img class="size-large wp-image-7471" src="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_130930953.jpeg?resize=1024%2C512&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="512" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_130930953.jpeg?resize=1024%2C512&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_130930953.jpeg?resize=300%2C150&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_130930953.jpeg?resize=768%2C384&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_130930953.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_130930953.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the spring and summer months, you are given what we call a</span><b> fitness freebie. </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You get a </span><b><i>seasonal motivation boost</i></b> <span style="font-weight: 400;">that doesn’t happen when temperatures start to drop, and you begin to pull out the chunky sweaters and comfy leggings. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not only is the sun shining (which makes you happier because of Vitamin D), you are wearing LESS clothing in the summer months. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I don’t know about you, but knowing I’m going to be exposing more skin makes walking in the gym a little easier. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Covering up in layers, no doubt leads to the temptation to slack on body goals! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Knowing your arms, legs, and abs will be less exposed can easily be an excuse to slack. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, being layered up often means you don’t SEE the extra pounds, so they are easier to ignore.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But there is more to it than being bundled up….</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-7477" src="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_236518834.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_236518834.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_236518834.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_236518834.jpeg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_236518834.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_236518834.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span>The #1 reason you slack on health and fitness goals in colder months ISN’T EVEN YOUR FAULT!!</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, you have a part to play in all of this, but</span><b><i> there is actually a scientific reason why you have less desire to train and eat healthy when the sunshine of summer fades.</i></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We will explain why a little further down. But ya know what really stinks? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The scientific reason why we all experience these motivation slumps in the winter only adds to an even bigger issue with motivation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span>It doesn’t matter what season it is motivation ALWAYS comes and goes!</p>
<p>Spring, Summer, Fall, or Winter &#8211; you can NEVER rely on it!</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, what can you do when lack of sunshine and warm temps leave you even more tempted to hit snooze and reach for comfort foods? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You certainly don’t throw your hands up in the air and wait until January to make a resolution to crash diet to get your body ready for spring. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Believe it or not, RIGHT NOW is actually the IDEAL time to get started! </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you </span><b><i>START NOW, </i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">you will develop discipline and a routine heading into the holidays. This will put you in a great place mentally and physically to relax and “indulge” a little more at all those holiday gatherings! </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><b><i>Look at it this way ..<br />
</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Would you rather head into the holiday season already making progress toward your goals and be in a great spot <em>(where it would be okay even if you did gain an extra pound or two?)</em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Or would you rather put it off and only add more fat on top of what you want to lose?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The answer is clear— the solution to getting the motivation needed to make it happen, not so much.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But don’t worry! We’ve got ya covered</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (no pun intended)</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with a few easy motivation hacks!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><b>7 TIPS TO STAY MOTIVATED AS SEASONS CHANGE</b></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><b><br />
</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the number one questions we always get is … “<em>I am just not motivated. How can I motivate myself to train and eat better?”</em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As we mentioned earlier, it doesn&#8217;t matter what season it is, </span><b><i>you can’t always rely on motivation. </i></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you have it, great! You should certainly take advantage of it! But you have to know that it is totally normal to not have much of it. Even professional athletes lack motivation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You have to develop other daily habits that create discipline if you want to succeed long term!</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are a few of our pro tips that we use with our clients, specifically when temperatures drop, and motivation seems to be at its lowest! </span></p>
<p><b>TIP #1: Switch To An At Home Training Program</b></p>
<p><img class="size-large wp-image-7448" src="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_185038762.jpeg?resize=1024%2C647&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="647" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_185038762.jpeg?resize=1024%2C647&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_185038762.jpeg?resize=300%2C189&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_185038762.jpeg?resize=768%2C485&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_185038762.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_185038762.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you know that getting out of bed and stepping into the winter elements is going to be an excuse trigger, make a plan to train at home during cooler months! Some of the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">most effective and challenging workouts </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">only require your body weight and </span><b><i>maybe</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a set of dumbbells or some resistance bands.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A good fat-blasting, muscle-building sweat session can 100% be achieved from the comfort of your home!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adjustable dumbbells, ankle weights, resistance bands, a jump rope, etc., are all things that are inexpensive and can easily be stored in a closet or under your bed and pulled out anytime you don’t feel like leaving the house.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But if you have </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">the right training program</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><b><i>you don’t need any of that. </i></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our favorite </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">at-home bodyweight-only program</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is called</span><b> MOVE. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was designed to help you achieve your fitness goals without a single piece of equipment, and each workout is under 20 minutes! </span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Learn more about MOVE by watching the video below!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you need </span><b>a little extra “nudge”</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to get up and get moving, another </span><b>pro-tip we use</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is keeping some </span><a href="https://sculptnation.com/products/pre-workout" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><b>PRE WORKOUT </b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">on your bedside table. Have it already blended up and chug it as soon as your alarm goes off!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By the time you have brushed your teeth and put on your workout clothes, you will have a nice little jolt of energy and</span><b><i> tons of motivation</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to get going before you have a chance to come up with an excuse! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the bottom of this article, we will tell you about a big end of summer sale happening so that you can stock up on our </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">favorite </span><a href="https://sculptnation.com/products/pre-workout" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><b>PRE WORKOUT</b></a><strong> for 40% off when you use code: LABORDAY40 at checkout! </strong></p>
<p><b>TIP #2: Make Your Workouts Seasonal</b></p>
<p><img class="size-large wp-image-7452" src="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_65703942.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_65703942.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_65703942.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_65703942.jpeg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_65703942.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_65703942.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Embrace the change of seasons and take advantage of activities that you can only do in fall or winter! </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Go on a fall hike and view all the gorgeous foliage.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Try rock climbing.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Walk around a corn maze or pumpkin patch with your family. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you live in a snowy climate, go skiing, sledding, build snowmen with your kids, etc.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Go ice skating.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lace-up your sneakers, go for a walk or run at night, and admire all the Christmas lights and decorations.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are some things you can only do and see during specific times of the year. So instead of missing sunshine and water sports, focus on all the positive things that only come about with cooler temps!</span></p>
<p><b>TIP #3: Try Something Totally New</b></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-7454" src="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_361152601.jpeg?resize=1024%2C514&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="514" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_361152601.jpeg?resize=1024%2C514&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_361152601.jpeg?resize=300%2C151&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_361152601.jpeg?resize=768%2C386&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_361152601.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_361152601.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sometimes a change of routine is all you need to boost motivation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you have been doing all your gym lifts alone, recruit a gym buddy! Try switching up your cardio by skipping your solo runs and joining a group fitness class instead. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another option is to </span><b><i>allow yourself to slow down!</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> If you have been crushing it all spring and summer with intense training and hardcore workouts, </span><b><i>it may actually be time to take it down a notch. </i></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Going full force 365 can cause your stress hormone cortisol to increase. This can lead to a host of drawbacks, including weight gain, muscle loss, poor moods, fatigue, and occasional issues sleeping! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We aren’t saying you should become lazy! But if you have been crushing it 24/7 all spring and summer, your body (and mind) may need to slow down.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Use the next few months to embrace a slower routine. </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Commit to daily yoga.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Focus on becoming more flexible.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Switch to low or moderate-intensity cardio, instead of HIIT.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Try out some bodyweight workouts instead of heavy lifting.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Giving your body a couple of months to recover might even make you more responsive when you decide to kick things up again come spring/summer!</span></p>
<p><b>TIP #4: Stay Accountable</b></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-7457" src="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_266584820.jpeg?resize=1024%2C768&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="768" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_266584820.jpeg?resize=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_266584820.jpeg?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_266584820.jpeg?resize=768%2C576&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_266584820.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_266584820.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><b><br />
</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">The best way to stick to a plan is to have someone that you report back to. This could be a friend, family member, a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">social media community</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, or even a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">coach. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Including someone else, or even just telling someone else about your health and fitness goals and asking them to check in with you to make sure you are sticking to the plan, is a great way to keep the promises you make to yourself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you prefer to fly solo, it helps to create visuals. Make a vision board, create a daily checklist you can mark off after each workout, or keep an accomplishment journal.</span></p>
<p><b>TIP #5: Set A Spring Goal</b></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-7458" src="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_47332240.jpeg?resize=1024%2C680&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="680" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_47332240.jpeg?resize=1024%2C680&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_47332240.jpeg?resize=300%2C199&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_47332240.jpeg?resize=768%2C510&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_47332240.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_47332240.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">March may seem like a long time away, but it will be back before you know it, and 6 months is a long time to make significant changes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Setting a goal is a great way to encourage yourself to push past discomforts and temptation, but there is a science to goal setting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The key to creating goals that stick .. </span><b><i>be REALISTIC and SPECIFIC!</i></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s start with </span><b><i>reality. </i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">You should always focus on one goal at a time and make sure you are being honest with yourself if that goal is really attainable.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you know that your schedule will never allow you to work out 6 days a week, why would you choose a program that requires you to do that?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you know it’s not healthy to attempt to lose 10 pounds a week, why would you aim that high?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you love carbs, why would you go on a KETO diet? </span></p>
<p><b><i>Doing these things will essentially set yourself up for failure.</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Set attainable goals that fit YOUR lifestyle. You can always bump things up if your schedule allows, or you notice you aren’t pushing yourself hard enough. Just keep in mind that being realistic isn’t the same as not believing in yourself or making excuses. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moving on to being </span><b><i>specific.</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The more specific you are about your goals, the more likely you will be to reach them. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It may seem like it’s good enough to say things like .. I want to look good, lose weight, or get ripped! </span><b><i>But you have to dig deeper than that!! </i></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wanting to “lose weight,” for example, is an excellent place to start. But ask yourself what that means to you?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you expand on that and say &#8212; “I want to lose 10 pounds of fat. I will do this by not eating any sweets and doing the V Shred </span><a href="https://vshred.com/sp/move/soc-all/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><b>MOVE </b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">program for 30 consecutive days. I am doing this because I want to have better self-esteem and a head start on bikini season.” &#8212; that makes your goal more specific.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The more specific (and attainable) your goals are, the more likely you will be to not give up!</span></p>
<p><b>TIP #6: Reward Yourself</b></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-7459" src="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/vin_sant_32048508_366936073798151_433609263865135104_n.jpg?resize=882%2C1024&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="882" height="1024" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/vin_sant_32048508_366936073798151_433609263865135104_n.jpg?resize=882%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 882w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/vin_sant_32048508_366936073798151_433609263865135104_n.jpg?resize=258%2C300&amp;ssl=1 258w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/vin_sant_32048508_366936073798151_433609263865135104_n.jpg?resize=768%2C892&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/vin_sant_32048508_366936073798151_433609263865135104_n.jpg?w=1080&amp;ssl=1 1080w" sizes="(max-width: 882px) 100vw, 882px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you have checked a “mini goal” off your list, treat yourself. Knowing that you have a reward coming to celebrate your efforts will make you want to achieve it even more. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It may be tempting to make your reward one of your favorite “forbidden foods” but we never suggest that you reward yourself this way.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You aren’t a dog. You should never reward “good behavior” with food. Having this mentality can create a really unhealthy relationship with food.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You need to eat healthy MOST of the time, control your portions, and see food as fuel. But if you are craving something that isn’t quite as healthy as your grilled chicken and rice, never feel like you need to lose 20 pounds to “deserve” a bite of cake, or nice dinner out with your family. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instead of rewarding yourself with food, buy yourself something you have been wanting. Maybe some new workout clothes, a massage, or an extra $20 bucks in your vacation fund! </span></p>

<p><b>TIP #7: Make Mental Health Top Priority</b></p>
<p><img class="size-large wp-image-7460" src="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_255894146.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_255894146.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_255894146.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_255894146.jpeg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_255894146.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_255894146.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Earlier, we mentioned that cold weather motivation dips may not be your fault.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’m sure you have heard of winter blues. Well, it’s a real thing. Less natural light can cause dips in serotonin, the neurotransmitter that regulates mood.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The dark and dreary days of winter can also cause your body to produce more of the sleep hormone melatonin. This shift can disrupt your body and impact your sleep patterns and overall mood.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are a few ways that you can focus on improving your mental health.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Invest in a light therapy box that simulates natural daylight.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Make sure you are supplementing with or eating plenty of foods with Vitamin D.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Start journaling. There is a lot of scientific evidence that supports putting your thoughts on paper provides a long list of benefits, including stress management, self-confidence, and goal setting. </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Suppose you still find yourself struggling with negative seasonal motivation shifts. In that case, you may need to experiment with taking</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> naturally sourced herbs</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to help support brain health and a positive mood.</span></p>
<p><b><i>Here are a few with some great scientific backing to help boost mood.</i></b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>EnXtra: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">A natural caffeine-free patent-pending botanical ingredient that has been shown to help increase dopamine levels.**It is also one of the first and only natural caffeine-free patent-pending botanical ingredients shown to boost mental alertness &amp; acuity for hours or ending in a huge caffeine energy crash.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Piper Nigrum Fruit Extract:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> A very specific type of black pepper that has been shown to help increase both serotonin and dopamine.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>L-Theanine:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> A powerful amino acid that is believed to help reduce occasional anxiety brought on by stressful situations.</span></li>
</ul>

<p><b><i>BOTTOM LINE IF YOU WANT TO STAY MOTIVATED YEAR ROUND</i></b><b><i><br />
</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you put away the shorts and swimsuits and shift out of bikini season, it’s common for motivation to “fall back” with the clocks. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The seasons have to change (unless you live near the equator) &#8211; so you have to figure out ways to</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">not let your fitness goals go into hibernation mode!</span><b><i> </i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pumpkin spice lattes are only here for a limited time, but getting into shape isn’t seasonal! </span><i>It&#8217;s a year-round commitment!!</i><i> </i></p>

<p>Summer is here and the sun is out! With the summer sun comes swimsuits, and swimsuits mean your body is going to be on full display.</p>
<p>Unlike the fellas, who can cover up their REAR VIEW in a pair of swim trunks, ladies have to expose it all.</p>
<p><em><strong>Not fair .. we know.</strong></em></p>
<p>BUT we’ve got you covered (so you can confidently be uncovered) &#8211; with a <em><strong>12-minute home glute workout</strong></em> &#8211; that will help you blast fat and build curves in all the right places!</p>
<p><em><strong>Speaking of the summer sun….</strong></em><br />
While the weather is pleasant, try leaving your living room and take your training outside!<br />
The fresh air and bright sunshine can be a great motivator to get moving!</p>
<p><em><strong>Studies say being outdoors….</strong></em></p>
<ul>
<li>Lowers stress hormones (which can impact things like appetite and weight)</li>
<li>Re-sets your ability to focus &amp; boosts creativity</li>
<li>Supports immune health</li>
<li>May help you burn a few more calories (because of the extra energy required.)</li>
<li>++ More</li>
</ul>
<p>Outdoor training may not be ideal for every workout, but the one we are showing you today is really short &#8211; only 12-minutes!</p>
<p>Don’t forget your sunscreen and plenty of water! Let’s get that summer booty poppin!</p>
<p>You don’t need any equipment for this workout, but if you have some weights or bands, feel free to add them.</p>
<p>We will perform all exercises as “super-sets” .. this means you will do “Exercise A &amp; B” without any rest in-between. Then you will get a quick break before moving on to the next superset, and so on.</p>
<p>The reason we are doing supersets is to keep things moving. This keeps your heart-rate up and will ensure you are getting the most out of your time.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>12-Minute Follow Along Booty Movements </strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Each exercise will be performed for 20 Seconds. Your rest periods between supersets will also be a quick 20-seconds.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you wanna lose that belly fat and get ripped six pack abs, you don&#8217;t need to hire an expensive personal trainer or go to the gym. All you need to do is get a dumbbell and follow these workout routines!</p>
<h2>Weighted Ab Workout For A Ripped Six Pack Abs</h2>
<h3></h3>
<h3>Start With Your Gut</h3>
<p><!-- instagram error: invalid instagram resource --></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">When it comes to getting ripped six pack abs, there’s one thing you should not overlook. Diet. So before you try this workout, if you’re not sure <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/healthy-eating-mistakes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">what you should be eating</a> in order to really chisel your abs, take my free body type quiz to learn the 3 most important things to do to see results.</span></p>
<div>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://vshred.com/sp/survey/survey-aka1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="s1">Click Here To Take The Free Body Type Quiz!</span></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Once your <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/healthy-eating-mistakes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">dietary concerns</a> are out of the way, it’s time to train those abs! Abs are just like any other muscle group, but smaller than most. That means you need to train them and let them recover just like any other muscle. So we recommend doing this weighted ab workout no more than every other day making sure to allow your abdominal muscles to recover completely.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">All you will need for this workout is a single dumbbell. You may pick the weight of your choice or use no weight at all (this depends on your physical capability) and do as follows:</span></p>
<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1">The Workout</span></h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There are four total exercises and for each exercise, you will do 4 sets of 10-15 reps with only 20 seconds of rest in-between. If you cannot handle this layout, you may extend your rest period slightly or break the sets into “mini sets” but make sure to complete the same total number of reps.</span></p>
<h3><span class="s1">Dumbbell Straight-Arm Crunches</span></h3>
<p><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/3ksxlaN8sLsKFMri0P"><img src="https://i0.wp.com/media.giphy.com/media/3ksxlaN8sLsKFMri0P/giphy.gif?resize=480%2C270&#038;ssl=1" alt="Animated GIF - Find &amp; Share on GIPHY" width="480" height="270" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In this abs routine, you’re going to lay flat on your back with your knees bent. Hold the dumbbell out straight above you and continue to push the dumbbell straight towards the ceiling as you crunch.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">4 sets of 10-15 reps. </span></p>
<h3><span class="s1">Dumbbell Reverse Crunches</span></h3>
<p><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/B1SY1kmjV1yVAJcbpJ"><img src="https://i2.wp.com/media.giphy.com/media/B1SY1kmjV1yVAJcbpJ/giphy.gif?resize=480%2C270&#038;ssl=1" alt="Animated GIF - Find &amp; Share on GIPHY" width="480" height="270" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Lay flat on your back again for this one but this time, place a dumbbell between your feet with your knees completely bent and thighs pointing straight up. Hold on to the dumbbell with your feet and bring your legs up toward your chest making sure your lower back gets off the ground. Focus on using your abs to pull your legs up and not getting momentum from your knees or feet. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">4 sets of 10-15 reps.</span></p>
<h3><span class="s1">Rotating Mountain Climbers</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For this one, get into a regular push-up position. Now, similar to mountain climbers, you will be driving your knees upward but will also do a twist as you do so. So you drive your knees to your opposite elbow as you twist your core.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">4 sets of 10-15 reps each way.</span></p>
<h3><span class="s1">Dumbbell Woodchops</span></h3>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Would you rather lose weight or get shredded? When looking for weight-loss diet plans for men, you should always go for the programs that still sustain muscle definition. Check out these best fat-loss diets for men.</p>
<h2>Top Fat-Burning, Muscle-Building Diet Plans for Men</h2>
<h3><span style="color: #000080;">1. Custom Diet and Training Plan for Him by V Shred</span></h3>
<p><!-- instagram error: invalid instagram resource --></p>
<p>The <a href="https://vshred.com/programs/custom-training-and-diet-plan-8-week" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Custom Diet and Training Plan for Him</a> by V Shred offers an all-in-one solution for men who are trying to lose weight and build lean muscle. V Shred customizes the plan according to your individual needs.</p>
<p>How? We take into account your body type, fitness goals, and athleticism, among other factors, to create the best shredding program for men. It&#8217;s like having a personal trainer for less.</p>
<p><strong>Trivia</strong>: Do you know professional athletes, models, and actors pay for their fitness coaches around $10,000 monthly on average?</p>
<h3><span style="color: #000080;">2. Atkins Diet</span></h3>
<p>The Atkins Diet is a popular low-carb weight-loss program. The idea behind this fat-burner diet plan for men is that you should consume few to zero carbs while dieting. You get most of your energy from <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/high-protein-diet-plans/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">protein and healthy fats</a>.</p>
<p>However, remember that too much fat and protein may have negative effects on you if you’re prone to heart disease.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #000080;">3. Time-Restricted Intermittent Fasting</span></h3>
<p>Time-restricted intermittent fasting is a diet plan that restricts your calorie consumption for a specific period of time. Depending on the person, your fasting time can range anywhere from 4 to 12 hours.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that almost all calorie-cutting diet plans for men will make you lose at least a few pounds of muscle. Time-restricted intermittent fasting won&#8217;t help you build muscle fast but there are plenty of ways to still grow muscle during the process.</p>
<p>Scheduling your meals accordingly and continuous muscle-building workouts help counteract muscle reduction while on this diet.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #000080;">4. Low-Calorie Diet</span></h3>
<p><!-- instagram error: invalid instagram resource --></p>
<p>This diet meal plan decreases the number of calories you consume in a day. The average man&#8217;s calorie consumption goes down from 2,000-2,500 calories per day to 800-1,200 calories.</p>
<p>When on this diet, make sure you still consume enough protein to support muscle growth. Around one gram of protein per pound of body weight is enough to keep your muscles from shrinking despite low-calorie intake.</p>
<p>Some examples of food that are good for this diet are tomatoes, celery, carrots, apples, and nuts. Add some beef, chicken breast, and eggs for your protein intake.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #000080;">5. Paleo Diet</span></h3>
<p>Plenty of people blame junk foods and fast food restaurants for obesity because of all the chemicals and additives in their products. Fitness buffs who want to lessen their consumption of additives and chemicals created the Paleo diet.</p>
<p>The theory behind this is to only eat foods you would get by hunting or fishing, just like our forefathers did in the Paleolithic era. It’s one of the simplest and most affordable diet plans for men on this list.</p>
<p>Consuming these food types allows you to get the nutrients you need to grow your muscles minus the unnecessary calories.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #000080;">6. The 5:2 Diet</span></h3>
<p>The 5:2 diet is currently the most popular subcategory of intermittent fasting. Instead of fasting for hours, here, you fast for days. You should only use this diet plan if you want to lose fat fast.</p>
<p>While it may not be able to sustain muscle growth, you can still offset your muscle-loss by doing specific exercises. For example, you can avoid cardio workouts and focus on heavy muscle-building workouts.</p>
<p><strong>Pro tips:</strong> Remember that you should not do this type of fasting for more than a few months. We strongly recommend consulting with your physician before deciding to try this type of diet plan for men.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #000080;">7. The Zone Diet</span></h3>
<p>The Zone Diet is basically a balanced program consisting of carbs, protein, fats, and other nutrients. Everything is fair game provided they are consumed in moderation.</p>
<p>This is great for weight loss because unlike other diet plans for men, the Zone Diet is a bit more flexible. You can freely add in the macros you need to promote muscle growth.</p>
<p>Remember: the key to sustaining muscle development despite trying to lose weight is to consume the right nutrients.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Check out the top three lies about diet plans for men:</strong></p>

<p>When trying out diet plans for men, it’s always best to consult with your physician first. Try to avoid certain meal plans that may have adverse effects on you.</p>
<p>That’s why it’s always best to go with a customized <a href="https://vshred.com/programs/custom-training-and-diet-plan-8-week" target="_blank" rel="noopener">meal plan</a> tailored to suit your needs, goals, and current level of athleticism. At the end of the day, the important thing is to create a healthy balance <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/why-not-losing-weight/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">between exercise</a>, diet, and supplementation.</p>

]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Many people wonder how to get a flat stomach. After all, when it comes to how you feel about your body, excess belly fat is a major annoyance.</p>
<p>Most people can deal with a larger-than-average bottom, a bigger chest, or even some affectionate arm jiggle. But if you have extra fat around your midsection, fitting into those skinny jeans or feeling sexy on the beach will be a bit tough.</p>
<p>In this guide, we’ll discuss what you need to know about getting a flat tummy. Most of your efforts should be placed on diet and exercise. While there is no magic pill, following the guidelines here will put you on the right path to a flatter stomach in no time!</p>
<h2>Learn How to Get a Flat Stomach Now</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong><span style="color: #000080;">Part 1: Taking Control of Your Diet</span></strong></h3>
<p>Some individuals who are reading this won’t need to lose that much weight and, for the most part, they will only be looking for ways to help define their abs. But if you have excess fat, you’ll need weight loss strategies to get a flat stomach. Follow these guidelines.</p>
<h3>Start Tracking Your Diet</h3>
<p><!-- instagram error: invalid instagram resource --></p>
<p>If you’ve never tracked your diet before, now is the time to start. Begin by getting a small journal and keeping it with you at all times. This will be your food diary, and in it, you will begin tracking everything you eat.</p>
<p>You can start by simply tracking your food and calculating your calories. Use online calorie counters or buy a pocket calorie book to find out the calorie counts of your favorite foods. Simply track to start, and don’t change what you do.</p>
<h3>Set a Caloric Intake Goal</h3>
<p>Now, you will need to start limiting your calories. If you have excess weight on your body, it’s probably because you’ve been eating too many calories and not exercising them off.</p>
<p>A pound of fat is equal to 3500 calories. Therefore, to lose one pound each week, you need to create a calorie deficit of 3500 calories each week (or 500 calories each day). Figure out how much you eat on average, then lower that amount by 3500 calories each week. That’s your calorie goal.</p>
<h3>Plan Your Meals</h3>
<p><!-- instagram error: invalid instagram resource --></p>
<p>To help you eat less, you’ll need to <em>change </em>the way you eat as well. This means a lot of planning.</p>
<p>Your goal should be to consume more fruits, veggies, healthy fats (olive oil, avocados), and lean protein (fish, chicken, turkey) and less processed fats, refined carbs, and sugar. This starts with not buying these unhealthy foods in the first place and stocking your fridge with healthy alternatives.</p>
<p>You’ll need to start planning what you eat – especially if you don’t have a lot of time. Make your lunch the night before, purchase pre-made salads or ready-made chicken to add to salads and stir-fries, and always have cut fruits and veggies in your fridge.</p>
<h3>Track Your Progress</h3>
<p>To avoid weight gain, make sure you are taking your measurements and tracking your progress. You must weigh and measure yourself once per week. Do not do this more than once per week because slight fluctuations may cause you to gain small amounts of weight before ultimately dropping pounds. Weighing and measuring yourself every day and expecting results will only make you lose motivation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong><span style="color: #000080;">Part 2: Belly Fat Burning Exercises</span></strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://vshred.com/blog/30-day-workout-challenge/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Getting into an exercise regimen</a> that works for you is the best way to get a flat stomach. In other words, not all exercise plans will work for everyone.</p>
<p>Fortunately, you will have a lot of leeway, but as a general rule, you have to mix <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/best-ab-workout-plan-for-beginners-only-4-minutes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ab exercises</a> with cardiovascular exercise. Let’s go over each of these workout types:</p>
<h3>Muscle-Building Exercises</h3>
<p><!-- instagram error: invalid instagram resource --></p>
<p>Having a flatter, more defined stomach is about two things. First, if you have too much weight around your belly, you need to remove this excess fat so that your abs can — first and foremost — be seen. Do this with diet changes and cardio.</p>
<p>Next, you need to better <em>define </em>those muscles that make up your abs. This is where <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/free-full-6-pack-abs-workout-video/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tummy-targeting exercises</a> come in. Try these two for starters:</p>
<p><strong>1. Plank-Ups</strong></p>
<p>The plank position is ideal for shaping and defining your core (abs). The plank-up is a variation of the traditional plank.</p>
<p>Start by getting into a plank position on a floor mat. Make sure your hands are directly beneath your elbows and shoulders. Your back should be completely straight, and your head should be down.</p>
<p>Now, take the weight off of the right hand/arm and go down to your elbow. Do the same on the other side. Go back up to straight arm position on the right, and repeat on the left. That’s one move.</p>
<p>Do the move 10 times or as many times as you can.</p>
<p><strong>2. Bicycle</strong></p>
<p>Lie on your back on a floor mat, bend your knees, and bring your legs up so that your thighs are perpendicular to the floor and your shins are parallel with the floor. Put your hands behind your head and lace your fingers, elbows out.</p>
<p>Now, starting with the right side, tighten your tummy muscles, and bring your right elbow to your left knee. As you do so, straighten your right leg out in front of you without lowering it. Come back to the center position, then do the same thing on the opposite side. This is one move. Do it kind of like you are riding a bike.</p>
<p>Repeat the move 20 to 30 times.</p>
<h3>Cardio Exercise</h3>
<p><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/9DyNgzhCR2M4YDpv3Q"><img src="https://i0.wp.com/media.giphy.com/media/9DyNgzhCR2M4YDpv3Q/giphy.gif?resize=480%2C270&#038;ssl=1" alt="Animated GIF - Find &amp; Share on GIPHY" width="480" height="270" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>Now that you have some ab-defining exercises, to begin with, you’ll need to <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/best-cardio-workout-for-running-stairs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">get in some cardio</a>, too. Here’s where you’ll have the most flexibility.</p>
<p>For example, you can start by joining a sports club or an intramural team. Try a sport that <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/running-for-weight-loss/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">has you running and moving a lot,</a> like basketball, soccer, volleyball, or tennis.</p>
<p>If you’d rather do something less competitive, take an aerobics class. Alternatively, if you’d like to work out alone, swimming, biking, and running are always options.</p>
<p>Just make sure that you’re working up a sweat. It’s better to go hard for a short period of time than it is to slowly and easily exercise for a long time.</p>
<p>A great way to get in a quick and fat-burning workout on a treadmill or bike, for example, is to try<span> </span><span class="scayt-misspell-word" data-scayt-word="HIIT" data-wsc-lang="en_US">HIIT</span><span> </span>– high-intensity interval training. This is where you go hard (90% &#8211; 100%) for a minute or so, then slow it down to 30% &#8211; 40% for an equal amount of time.</p>
<p>You go back and forth like this 4 or 5 times, and that’s your workout!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong><span style="color: #000080;">Extra Tips to Aid Your Progress</span></strong></h3>
<p>Here are some other tips to keep in mind throughout the process of learning how to get a flat stomach:</p>
<h3>Master Self Motivation</h3>
<p><!-- instagram error: invalid instagram resource --></p>
<p>Getting fit and getting flat abs is certainly about what you eat and how you exercise, but it’s also about your mindset. You need to get your head on straight before you begin!</p>
<p>A good way to keep yourself motivated is to keep a journal. Write about <em>why </em>you want to get fitter and lose weight. Put up Post-it notes to remind you throughout the day, or set alarms on your phone.</p>
<p>You might also tell your friends what you are doing, and ask for their encouragement. Tell your family, too, as you all may be able to get fit together (who couldn’t use a flatter stomach!?).</p>
<h3>Know How to Dine Out</h3>
<p>One challenge that many people run into is eating out at restaurants or parties. Once you get to these places, all diet rules seem to go out the window!</p>
<p>To master eating out and eating at restaurants, remember that planning is everything. The best way to get through an event where there will be tempting foods is to plan ahead. For example, if you want to have a piece of cake, go for it, but forgo the daily granola bar snack. If you want to have a glass of wine, great. That’s okay, but eat less salad dressing at lunch.</p>
<p>Next, make sure that you know what will be on the menu. Check online for restaurant menus, or ask the party planner. Then, you can plan what you will have at the event and work it into your weekly food intake.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong><span style="color: #000080;">Fallen Off the Wagon? There’s No Time Like the Present to Start Again!</span></strong></h3>
<p>Going on a new diet for weight loss and starting a new exercise regimen to better define your abs is tough. This is why it is important to keep your head even if you don’t consistently hit your goals every day.</p>
<p>Many people wonder how to get a flat stomach. After all, when it comes to how you feel about your body, excess belly fat is a major annoyance.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Truth is, there are tons of workouts to choose from. But if you’re looking to separate the best workout to lose weight from the rest, this workout will end your quest.</p>
<div class="embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9 mb-5">
<!-- iframe plugin v.4.4 wordpress.org/plugins/iframe/ -->
<iframe src="//youtube.com/embed/TAxI7YbZqBU" class="embed-responsive-item box-shadow-wide" width="100%" height="500" scrolling="yes" frameborder="0"></iframe>
</div>
<p class="p1">There are a few major factors that help determine what the best workout to lose weight is for you.</p>
<p class="p1">While those determining factors may differ from person to person, hopefully this workout includes a couple benefits that you like.</p>
<h3 class="p1">The Benefits</h3>
<ul>
<li class="p1">It only takes 4 minutes. So it’s not intimidating.</li>
<li class="p1">It’s a very simple workout. Only two exercises.</li>
<li class="p1">It burns tons of calories. During and after the workout.</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="p1">The Best Workout to Lose Weight</h2>
<p class="p1">This workout will only be two exercises. Each exercise will be performed for 20 seconds and followed up with a 10 second rest.</p>
<p class="p1">You will perform each exercise back to back until all 4 minutes are completed.</p>
<h3 class="p1">The Exercises</h3>
<h4 class="p1">Alternating Jumps with Reach</h4>
<p class="p1">For this exercise, you will start in pushup position. From there, you will hop your feet off the ground and hop one foot up near your hand with the other foot remaining back. Then hop again and switch feet. Do this as many times as you can for 20 seconds, then rest for 10 seconds.</p>
<h4 class="p1">Crab Toe Touches</h4>
<p class="p1">Here, you will flip over onto your butt and lift your butt off the ground with your hands and your feet. This is the crab position. From there, you will take one arm and the opposite leg and bring them up together at the top. Then return them back to the ground and switch arms and legs. Do this as many times as you can for 20 seconds and rest for 10 seconds.</p>
<p class="p1">After you have completed the entire four rounds of the workout, your workout will be over. It will not take long but it will be a great workout as long as you give it your all!</p>
<p class="p1">So try this workout and be sure to share it with your friends. Also, don’t forget to leave any comments down below!</p>

<p class="p1"><a href="https://vshred.com/sp/survey/survey-aka1?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=post&amp;utm_campaign=v-shred&amp;utm_content=leg-day-workout-done-at-home-bodyweight-only&amp;utm_term=4" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>But after you do this workout, you need to make sure the rest of your workouts and your diet are taken care of. Use this free body type quiz to find out exactly how to get in shape faster and easier!</strong></a></p>
<p class="p1">Leg workouts are far from hard to find. But the best leg workout can be a little more difficult to figure out.</p>
<p class="p1">This one is a bunch of bodyweight exercises that maintain optimal tension on your muscles. Also, this is extremely effective for getting the right amount of volume that your legs need to get stronger and firmer!</p>
<h2 class="p1">The Best Leg Day Workout</h2>
<p class="p1">This leg day workout will consist of 5 different exercises. Each exercise will be performed for 3 sets of 15 reps with a one minute rest in between each set.</p>
<h3 class="p1">The Exercises</h3>
<h4 class="p1">Squat Rocks</h4>
<p class="p1">For this first exercise, you will start down in the bottom position of a squat. From there, you will remain as low as you can, while going forward and up on your toes. This should work your calves nicely. Then lower your heels back down to the ground. After your heels are back down, remain down in the squat position and shift your weight back on your heels and lift your toes off the ground. Then return your toes back to the ground and rock back and forth like this 15 times both ways. Then you will rest for one minute and repeat for 3 sets.</p>
<h4 class="p1">3 Point Lunges</h4>
<p class="p1">Here, you will be doing a series of lunges in 3 different directions. So starting by standing up straight, you will first lunge forward.. Then bring your foot back in, without touching it back on the ground, you will immediately go into a side lunge with that same leg. Then bring it back in and without touching it to the ground, immediately go into a back lunge. Then witch legs and do this with the opposite leg. After you have worked your way all the way around, that will be one rep. Repeat for 15 reps total and rest for a minute. Then do it twice more and move into the next exercise.</p>
<h4 class="p1">Frog Pumps</h4>
<p class="p1">This is a great exercise for the glutes and are very similar to glute bridges. You will start by laying on your back, then bring your feet in closer so your knees are similar to sit-up position. After that, you’ll bring your heels together so they are touching each other. Then drive your heels into the ground with your knees wider than your feet and bridge up as high as you can. Return your back back to about an inch off the ground and repeat for 15 reps.</p>
<h4 class="p1">4 Way Squat Hops</h4>
<p class="p1">For this exercise, you are going to be doing squat hops in four directions. So standing up straight, you will go down into a squat, then hop up off the ground to your left side. Then immediately go into a squat and hop up and jump back to where you just came from. Then squat down and hop to the right. Squat down hop back to the middle again. Then rather than going back to the left, you will squat down and hop forward. Then squat down again and hop back to the middle. Then as the last direction, you’ll squat down and hop backwards. Then squat down and hop back to the middle again. This will equal one rep. Repeat this left, right, forward and backward method for 15 total reps then rest for a minute. Repeat two more times and move into the final exercise.</p>
<h4 class="p1">Alternating Single Leg RDL Hops</h4>
<p class="p1">For the last exercise, you will start out by doing a single leg RDL. So starting off by balancing on one leg, you will bend forward, keeping a soft bend in your leg that on the ground, then bring your opposite leg going out behind you. Then tap your fingers to the ground and explode through your glutes and hamstrings to drive your back leg up and hop off the ground. Then after landing back on the ground, switch legs and do the exact same to the other side. Repeat for 15 reps with each leg. After you’ve done 15 reps, rest for a minute and repeat 2 more times.</p>
<p class="p1">Once all exercises are completed for 3 sets of 15 reps, you are done with the workout!</p>

<p class="p1">Remember, a single workout will only get you so far when trying to get in shape. You need to make sure you’re following an all around plan that matches your body type.. And then the results will come much faster! <a href="https://vshred.com/sp/survey/survey-aka1?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=post&amp;utm_campaign=v-shred&amp;utm_content=10-best-back-exercises-to-build-muscle&amp;utm_term=4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Click here to use our free body type quiz and learn exactly what to do to get in shape fast!</a></p>
<p class="p1">Building a back that you’re proud of can be difficult. But it becomes much easier when you’re doing exercises that will actually work it properly.</p>
<p class="p1">Here are 10 of the best back exercises for building muscle and strength!</p>
<h2 class="p1">The Best Back Exercises</h2>
<h3 class="p1">Rack Pulls</h3>
<p class="p1">These are one of the best exercises there are for building mass. Due to the short range of motion, you are able to go much heavier than you could on a regular deadlift. Also, this will focus more heavily on your back than your legs as well.</p>
<p class="p1">You want to set the bar up at about knee height. From there you will step up to the bar, with it touching your knees. Sit back on your heels, retract your scapula and drive your hips forward as you slide the bar across your thighs. From there, you can either drop the weight or return it back down slowly.</p>
<h3 class="p1">Barbell Rows</h3>
<p class="p1">This is one of the best compound back exercises there are due to it hitting so many different muscles, while focusing on your back the most. For these, you will pick the bar up, sit back on your heels, and bend over as you lower the bar in front of you away from your body. Then you will take your elbows and drive them back and out at a 45 degree angle and control it on the way back down.</p>
<h3 class="p1">Deadlifts</h3>
<p class="p1">Commonly referred to as the best compound exercise ever, these have an outstanding effect on the back muscles as well. Starting with the bar on the ground.. You will step up to the bar with your feet shoulder width and shins nearly touching the bar. Then you will grab the bar just outside of your shins and roll your shoulders back and press them down.. This will help pull the “slack” out of the bar. Then you will lift the bar up, sliding it<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>up your legs and once the bar is above your knees, drive your hips forward and stand straight up. Also, don’t forget to lock out your glutes at the top.</p>
<h3 class="p1">Weighted Pull-ups</h3>
<p class="p1">These are a great advanced variation to a regular pull-up. Starting with your hands outside of shoulder width, you will grab the pull up bar and hang. From there, without kicking, start to pull yourself up and act like you’re pulling your elbows in towards your side. Once at the top, return yourself back down in a controlled manner.</p>
<h3 class="p1">Weighted Chin-ups</h3>
<p class="p1">Very similar to weighted pull-ups but you will start with your palms facing you and hands much closer. From there you will pull yourself up, without kicking, and drive your elbows down and back until your chin is at the bar. Then return yourself back down in a controlled manner as well.</p>
<h3 class="p1">Straight Arm Pushdowns</h3>
<p class="p1">A great exercise for the “sweep” of the lats. You will use a cable attachment of your choice and put it to the top. From there you will grab it and feel a stretch in your lats at the top. Then, with a soft bend in your elbows, drive your arms down and back until the attachment is near your belly button. Then return back to the top and the stretch in your lats again.</p>
<h3 class="p1">Dumbbell Rows</h3>
<p class="p1">One of the best dumbbell back exercises. You will take a dumbbell in one hand with the other hand supporting your body. Then you will, first, bring the dumbbell backward and then row the weight up. This will help you feel it in your lat more. Then return back down the same way. Don’t forget to do both arms.</p>
<h3 class="p1">Cable Rows</h3>
<p class="p1">These are a staple in most back workouts and for good reason. For these, you can use any attachment you like. You just want to get your body in a strong position with your knees slightly bent and your back slightly leaning back. Then you will, again, drive your arms down and back towards your belly button. Then return the same way. Try to feel a stretch at the bottom of the exercise as well.</p>
<h3 class="p1">Lat Pulldowns</h3>
<p class="p1">These are a great exercise no matter your goal. You will get in a lat pulldown machine and grab the bar just outside of shoulder width. From there, you will take your elbows and drive them down and into your sides, feeling a squeeze on your lats. Then control it on the way back up and feel the stretch at the top.</p>
<h3 class="p1">Close Grip Lat Pulldowns</h3>
<p class="p1">Very similar to regular lat pulldowns but you will use an attachment that allows for a close grip. From there, you want to aim to feel a stretch at the top. Then drive your elbows down in front of you and squeeze them back. And return the weight back in a controlled manner.</p>
<p class="p1">You can pick from these exercises the next time you’re going to do a back workout. Aim for 4 of these for 4 sets each and you will have a great back workout!</p>

<p class="p1">Remember, workouts without understanding your body type could be a waste of time! If you want to know your body type and exactly what to do to get i shape, take our free body type quiz now! <strong><a href="https://vshred.com/sp/survey/survey-aka1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Click here to take the quiz!</a></strong></p>
<p class="p1">Truth is, we’re all pressed for time. With all the different responsibilities you have, how are you supposed to workout for an hour or even more?</p>
<p class="p1">You don’t have to!</p>
<p class="p1">When you change your workout style, and start doing high intensity interval training, workouts become shorter and results happen faster.</p>
<p class="p1">This is only a 4 minute workout that will leave you gassed and will burn tons of calories!</p>
<p class="p1">Plus, you don’t need any weights or equipment, so you can do it anywhere, at any time. Try it out!</p>
<h2 class="p1">4 Minute Cardio Workout</h2>
<p class="p1">In this workout, I take you through a quick, but effective workout to target body fat all over!</p>
<p class="p1">It&#8217;s going to be 4 exercises done for 20 seconds on with a 10 second rest. Then you&#8217;ll repeat each exercise twice to equal the full 4 minutes.</p>
<h3 class="p1">The Exercises:</h3>
<h4 class="p1">Half Burpees</h4>
<p class="p1">For this exercise, you will start down on the ground on your hands and feet. From there, you will jump your feet backs if going down for a burpee. Then jump your feet forward towards your hands like you’re going to jump up for a burpee. But instead of jumping up, jump your feet back out and repeat as many times as you can for 20 seconds. Then rest for 10 seconds and move onto the next exercise.</p>
<h4 class="p1">Jump Squats</h4>
<p class="p1">Here, you will get into a squat position, with your feet at shoulder width. From there, you will squat down, and starting from the bottom, you will explode up into a jump. Then land and go right back into your next squat. Repeat as many jump squats as you can for 20 seconds. Then rest for another 10 seconds and move onto the next exercise.</p>
<h4 class="p1">Bicycles</h4>
<p class="p1">This is a great ab exercise where you will start by laying on your back with your hands on the back of your head. From there, you will bring one knee up as high as you can, while crunching up and bringing one elbow down to meet your knee. Then repeat to the other side and do as many times as you can for 20 seconds. After this, rest for 10 seconds and move into the fourth and final exercise.</p>
<h4 class="p1">Spider Man Pushups</h4>
<p class="p1">Here, you will be doing an advanced variation of a pushup. Starting in a pushup position, you will lower yourself to the floor as you bring your knee up and out to the side. Bring it as close to your elbow as possible. Then as you press yourself back up, return your foot back to the starting position. Then repeat to the other side and do this as many times as you can for 20 seconds. If you already struggle with push-ups, don’t worry about the crunch and just do push-ups.</p>
<p class="p1">After completing all four exercises, you will rest for 10 seconds then repeat this cycle one more time.</p>
<p class="p1">Share this if you plan on trying it out and comment your thoughts down below!</p>
