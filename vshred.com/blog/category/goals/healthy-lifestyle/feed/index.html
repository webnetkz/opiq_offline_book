								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the least likely times, amidst the COVID-19 quarantine, Shady found a lifeline she didn’t even realize she needed. Our V Shred community helped her go from over 250 pounds and unable to play with her kids to an energetic 40-year old that is now on a mission to inspire others. We hope Shady’s V Shred transformation gives you some motivation today!</p>

<h2>Looking For Something More &#8211; Getting Started with V Shred</h2>
<p>Shady is a single mom of two young children that hustles hard, working two jobs to provide for her family.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s hard to believe that this now bubbly and confident 40-year old was almost 70 pounds heavier and battling depression.</p>
<p>At the beginning of 2020, Shady was 252 pounds and in denial.</p>
<blockquote><p>“I felt healthy, but then things started going downhill. My joints were sore, I was having a hard time walking. I couldn&#8217;t go bike riding with the kids. I became lazy and depressed.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Those feelings easily became amplified when COVID-19 hit. After all, she lost her side job in retail, her housecleaning business suffered, and she found herself isolated at home alone with her 2 kids.</p>
<p>But instead of spiraling downward, Shady decided to use her free time to self-reflect. She admitted she had let herself go and took the first step in regaining her health.</p>
<blockquote><p>“I started slowly by walking outside. That gave me the jumpstart. I started to feel better, but I was looking for something more hardcore.”</p></blockquote>
<p>It just so happens that a V Shred ad popped up on Shady’s Facebook page.</p>
<p>She began scrolling and reading transformation stories of women just like her. She instantly knew the V Shred community was exactly the push she needed. She was ready for her own V Shred transformation!</p>
<blockquote><p>“Before I even started day one, I was on the community page, reading these women’s posts of inspiration, and love, and encouragement. It was average women that showed before and afters. Just reading how supportive everybody was, that was a huge part of it for me.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Without hesitation, she downloaded the V Shred app and purchased the <a href="https://vshred.com/sp/fat-loss-extreme-f/sku_CKcwR4TEg54IeG?utm_source=blog-shady&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=female-motivation-testimonial&amp;utm_content=FLE-zee.j&amp;utm_term=5">Fat Loss Extreme program</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>“It kicked my butt! I even felt better after just one day.”</p></blockquote>
<h2>Community Helped Shady&#8217;s V Shred Transformation Mean Something More</h2>
<p>Working out wasn’t unfamiliar territory for Shady. At one time, she was a fitness instructor! It was the dieting part that was foreign. But thanks to the free information in the V Shred app and pointers from thousands of new friends, Shady taught herself how to track macros and eat clean.</p>
<blockquote><p>“I didn’t realize that diet was 80% of it. All the information that you get with the app, it&#8217;s just so helpful and really insightful. It&#8217;s easy to follow and such a good program.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Before long, Shady was no longer reading other women&#8217;s success stories. She had the confidence to post her own inspiring before and after pictures.</p>
<blockquote><p>“It is absolute sister love, it truly is. It&#8217;s like you have connections with these people from all over the world. It&#8217;s incredible.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Shady’s new love for health and fitness also led her to set an example for her two young kids.</p>
<blockquote><p>“My son was only eating Kraft dinners, hot dogs, and garbage food. I was like, you know what guys, you&#8217;re 9 and 10, I want you guys to be healthy for life and not do it as late as I did. We literally went through the entire house and donated everything that we could that was not nutritional.”</p></blockquote>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-7650" src="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/shady-healthy-lifestyle-family.png?resize=1024%2C390&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="390" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/shady-healthy-lifestyle-family.png?resize=1024%2C390&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/shady-healthy-lifestyle-family.png?resize=300%2C114&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/shady-healthy-lifestyle-family.png?resize=768%2C292&amp;ssl=1 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Every day wasn’t easy. There were moments when Shady wanted to quit.</p>
<blockquote><p>“You have those days you just want to stay into the covers and close the blinds and shut everyone out. But then the kids would come into my room and say, mom, let&#8217;s go for a walk!”</p></blockquote>
<p>In just over 3 months, with no gym, only her V Shred app and online community, Shady lost almost 70 pounds! Her physical V Shred transformation even gave her the confidence to join a burlesque dance group and wear a sexy new dress to celebrate turning 40 years young!</p>

I would post pictures on Facebook, and people would ask, what are you doing? Of course, I told them about the <a href="https://vshred.com/sp/fat-loss-extreme-f/sku_CKcwR4TEg54IeG?utm_source=blog-shady&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=female-motivation-testimonial&amp;utm_content=FLE-zee.j&amp;utm_term=5">V Shred program</a>. ”</p></blockquote>
<h2>Setting Her Sights Forward With Everyone She Loves</h2>
<p>Shady now weighs a more healthy 185 pounds and is setting her focus on building lean muscle by incorporating Sculpt Nation supplements and starting the V Shred <a href="https://vshred.com/sp/toned-in-90-days/v1/?utm_source=blog-shady&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=female-motivation-testimonial&amp;utm_content=FLE-zee.j&amp;utm_term=5">Toned In 90 Days</a> and <a href="https://vshred.com/sp/the-booty-builder/v1/?utm_source=blog-shady&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=female-motivation-testimonial&amp;utm_content=FLE-zee.j&amp;utm_term=5">BootyBuilder</a> programs.</p>
<p>Shady is excited to see just how far new love for fitness can take her, but more than a better body, she just wants her journey to continue to inspire and motivate others to start or continue their own V Shred transformation.</p>
<blockquote><p>“The fact that I&#8217;ve inspired people and it&#8217;s really crazy. It gives me goosebumps. My friends are just like, what are you doing? I want to feel the way you feel. I want to continue to give that to people and inspire people and make them feel good. That&#8217;s all I want.”</p></blockquote>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Most successful weight-loss transformation stories start with an “aha” moment. That sudden shift in mindset that pushes someone to stop coming up with every reason why they can’t do something and instead take the first step towards making a lasting change.</p>
<p>Dylan’s personal story of tragedy, and weight loss then muscle-gain triumph with V Shred will inspire you.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-7526 size-full" src="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/117163427_4254430027932957_2001345014807689283_n.jpg?resize=960%2C960&#038;ssl=1" alt="Dylan's V Shred weight-loss transformation before, during, after photo" width="960" height="960" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/117163427_4254430027932957_2001345014807689283_n.jpg?w=960&amp;ssl=1 960w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/117163427_4254430027932957_2001345014807689283_n.jpg?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 150w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/117163427_4254430027932957_2001345014807689283_n.jpg?resize=300%2C300&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/117163427_4254430027932957_2001345014807689283_n.jpg?resize=768%2C768&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/117163427_4254430027932957_2001345014807689283_n.jpg?resize=60%2C60&amp;ssl=1 60w" sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>For 28-year-old Dylan, his “aha” moment was a combination of his own life set-backs that resulted in weight gain and depression. When those were coupled with the sudden loss of his brother and surviving a natural disaster (on the same day) he knew it was time for a change.</p>
<p>Dylan grew up a football star. Everything was going as planned through high school until he lost a university scholarship and his dreams were crushed. <em>“I went to work, came home, and sat in front of the TV. That was pretty much it.”</em> for years after, explains Dylan.</p>
<p>At an unhealthy 355 pounds, the mental and physical misery Dylan felt every day still wasn’t enough to push him to do something about it. The depression told him he was too far gone. <em>“I didn’t go out because I hated the way I looked. I wouldn’t take my shirt off, even for my girlfriend. It was hard because I used to be this person that was athletic and outgoing. I knew I let myself go, but I thought at that point, there was no fixing it.”</em></p>
<p>The year 2017 was a dark period and the lowest point of Dylan’s life. He saw he was headed in the same direction as someone else he loved. “<em>My brother had depression and substance abuse issues. He was even bigger than I was, and his depression was brought on by his weight. He wasn&#8217;t happy with himself.”</em></p>
<h2>A Day That Changed Everything</h2>
<p>On September 10, 2017 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Irma">Hurricane Irma</a> hit Dylan’s home state of Florida. On the very same day his brother committed suicide. <em>“I swore at that moment, I wasn&#8217;t going to turn into that.”</em></p>
<p>It was the perfect storm to create a lightning bolt moment (his aha.) Dylan knew he had to make a change. His life depended on it.</p>
<p>Scared, and even a little intimidated, Dylan decided to take the first step of his weight-loss transformation. “I&#8217;d seen V Shred almost every single day for two weeks, and I finally clicked the ad, and it was the best thing I ever did.”</p>
<h2>Starting A Weight-Loss Transformation With V Shred</h2>
<p>The former football star knew <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/strength-training/">how to lift weights</a> with a coach screaming down his neck, but had no clue how to workout by himself. Being in the gym, alone, without a coach or teammates was entirely different. As he started to learn more about nutrition in those early days Dylan also realized he didn’t have the slightest clue about cardio or nutrition.</p>
<p>Thankfully, he didn’t have to learn everything alone. The <a href="https://vshred.com/programs/fat-loss-extreme?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=male-motivation-testimonial&amp;utm_content=FLE-male-zee.j&amp;utm_term=5">V Shred Fat Loss Extreme</a> plan laid everything out for him. He simply had to put in the work. <em>“I had an extreme goal. I wanted to lose a hundred pounds within a year. I blew that out the water. I got on pace to where I already knew I was going to hit my goal, and I just kept going.”</em></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-7596 size-full" src="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/24AC0918-158B-4FCE-9E61-6D7A1EE801B0_1_201_a.jpeg?resize=750%2C870&#038;ssl=1" alt="Dylan's V Shred Fat Loss Extreme weight-loss transformation After photo" width="750" height="870" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/24AC0918-158B-4FCE-9E61-6D7A1EE801B0_1_201_a.jpeg?w=750&amp;ssl=1 750w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/24AC0918-158B-4FCE-9E61-6D7A1EE801B0_1_201_a.jpeg?resize=259%2C300&amp;ssl=1 259w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>Dylan also found a lot of help from the V Shred community online, which gave him support and new ideas for exercises and <a href="https://vshred.com/sp/recipe-guide/v1?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=socialmedia&amp;utm_campaign=male-motivation-testimonial&amp;utm_content=FLE-male-zee.j&amp;utm_term=5">recipes</a>. <em>“The V Shred Group “is like Google! It’s constantly refreshing itself for me. Everybody’s in the same mindset that I&#8217;m in, searching without me even having to search.”</em></p>
<p>In his first year with V Shred, Dylan dropped 135 pounds. But his transformation didn’t stop there. He got all the way down to 180 pounds!</p>
<p>After a grand total of 155 pounds lost, Dylan decided to end his weight loss journey, but not in the way you may think.</p>
<h2>Changing His Goals &amp; Changing His Mindset</h2>
<p>Dylan decided to do something that may have been even harder than the initial weight loss.</p>
<p>He started <a href="https://vshred.com/programs/clean-bulk-program?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=socialmedia&amp;utm_campaign=male-motivation-testimonial&amp;utm_content=FLE-male-zee.j&amp;utm_term=5">V Shred&#8217;s Clean Bulk Program</a> to build the muscle needed to reshape his new skinnier body. <em>“I developed body dysmorphia. I became afraid of eating too much. So going from losing all that weight to knowing I have to eat in a surplus and gain weight was a struggle for me.”</em></p>
<p>Dylan quickly learned that his V Shred coaches knew what they were doing. They had a weight-loss transformation plan that would allow him to build muscle without gaining a ton of excess fat.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-7597 size-full" src="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/0AF6A317-A447-4CC1-AEDB-18CA271B8EF2_1_201_a.jpeg?resize=750%2C744&#038;ssl=1" alt="Dylan's V Shred Clean Bulk weight-loss transformation and muscle gain After photo" width="750" height="744" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/0AF6A317-A447-4CC1-AEDB-18CA271B8EF2_1_201_a.jpeg?w=750&amp;ssl=1 750w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/0AF6A317-A447-4CC1-AEDB-18CA271B8EF2_1_201_a.jpeg?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 150w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/0AF6A317-A447-4CC1-AEDB-18CA271B8EF2_1_201_a.jpeg?resize=300%2C298&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/0AF6A317-A447-4CC1-AEDB-18CA271B8EF2_1_201_a.jpeg?resize=60%2C60&amp;ssl=1 60w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>After a 3 year journey with V Shred, Dylan sits at 210 pounds of lean muscle.</p>
<p>But the external transformation is only half of his life-changing results. Dylan is a new man both inside and out. He has developed confidence and a fresh zest for the life he shares with his fiancé and two kids.</p>
<p>Dylan’s weight-loss transformation, however, hasn’t come without setbacks. COVID limitations made it hard to hit heavy weights, and over Labor Day weekend, he had an accident that dislodged two ribs!</p>
<p>Instead of getting down about not being able to lift heavy enough to continue his bulk, he shifted his mindset. Dylan decided that he would attempt his very first “cut” using <a href="https://vshred.com/sp/ripped-in-90-days/sku_AR6nTj3PTK3uu9?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=male-motivation-testimonial&amp;utm_content=FLE-male-zee.j&amp;utm_term=5">V Shred Ripped In 90 Days</a>. We can’t wait to see his next set of transformation pictures!!</p>
<p>Dylan&#8217;s advice to anyone scared of or too hesitant to purchase a plan is this …</p>
<p><em>“Everyone asks me “the secret”. You have the basic responses; diet is key and hit the gym hard. But those are common knowledge. <strong>There is one thing that is going to get you the results you want &#8211; eliminate the excuses!</strong> The “I’m tired., I’ll go harder tomorrow” or “I can’t find the time” won’t work, and will only hold you back.

That is a scary number!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Good thing you found this article because </span><b><i>we aren’t going to let YOU be “most” people! </i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lower temps do not have to equal larger waistlines! You just have to have a plan! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this short read we will &#8230;</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Explain why winter weight gain happens. Knowing why is important if you want to prevent it and the reason is probably not what you think. In fact, it is partially not even your fault!</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tell you why fall/winter is actually the BEST time to start a diet and training plan.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Give you 7 easy pro tips that will help guide you through the next few months. </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You may believe winter weight gain happens because of the holidays. Those extra home cooked meals and holiday parties are certainly a factor. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But </span><b><i>there is a DAILY issue you need to be prepared to fight </i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">if you want to avoid packing on winter pounds.</span></p>
<p><b>WHY YOU REALLY PACK ON POUNDS AFTER LABOR DAY</b></p>
<p><img class="size-large wp-image-7471" src="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_130930953.jpeg?resize=1024%2C512&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="512" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_130930953.jpeg?resize=1024%2C512&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_130930953.jpeg?resize=300%2C150&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_130930953.jpeg?resize=768%2C384&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_130930953.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_130930953.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the spring and summer months, you are given what we call a</span><b> fitness freebie. </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You get a </span><b><i>seasonal motivation boost</i></b> <span style="font-weight: 400;">that doesn’t happen when temperatures start to drop, and you begin to pull out the chunky sweaters and comfy leggings. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not only is the sun shining (which makes you happier because of Vitamin D), you are wearing LESS clothing in the summer months. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I don’t know about you, but knowing I’m going to be exposing more skin makes walking in the gym a little easier. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Covering up in layers, no doubt leads to the temptation to slack on body goals! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Knowing your arms, legs, and abs will be less exposed can easily be an excuse to slack. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, being layered up often means you don’t SEE the extra pounds, so they are easier to ignore.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But there is more to it than being bundled up….</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-7477" src="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_236518834.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_236518834.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_236518834.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_236518834.jpeg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_236518834.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_236518834.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span>The #1 reason you slack on health and fitness goals in colder months ISN’T EVEN YOUR FAULT!!</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, you have a part to play in all of this, but</span><b><i> there is actually a scientific reason why you have less desire to train and eat healthy when the sunshine of summer fades.</i></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We will explain why a little further down. But ya know what really stinks? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The scientific reason why we all experience these motivation slumps in the winter only adds to an even bigger issue with motivation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span>It doesn’t matter what season it is motivation ALWAYS comes and goes!</p>
<p>Spring, Summer, Fall, or Winter &#8211; you can NEVER rely on it!</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, what can you do when lack of sunshine and warm temps leave you even more tempted to hit snooze and reach for comfort foods? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You certainly don’t throw your hands up in the air and wait until January to make a resolution to crash diet to get your body ready for spring. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Believe it or not, RIGHT NOW is actually the IDEAL time to get started! </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you </span><b><i>START NOW, </i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">you will develop discipline and a routine heading into the holidays. This will put you in a great place mentally and physically to relax and “indulge” a little more at all those holiday gatherings! </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><b><i>Look at it this way ..<br />
</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Would you rather head into the holiday season already making progress toward your goals and be in a great spot <em>(where it would be okay even if you did gain an extra pound or two?)</em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Or would you rather put it off and only add more fat on top of what you want to lose?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The answer is clear— the solution to getting the motivation needed to make it happen, not so much.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But don’t worry! We’ve got ya covered</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (no pun intended)</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with a few easy motivation hacks!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><b>7 TIPS TO STAY MOTIVATED AS SEASONS CHANGE</b></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><b><br />
</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the number one questions we always get is … “<em>I am just not motivated. How can I motivate myself to train and eat better?”</em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As we mentioned earlier, it doesn&#8217;t matter what season it is, </span><b><i>you can’t always rely on motivation. </i></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you have it, great! You should certainly take advantage of it! But you have to know that it is totally normal to not have much of it. Even professional athletes lack motivation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You have to develop other daily habits that create discipline if you want to succeed long term!</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are a few of our pro tips that we use with our clients, specifically when temperatures drop, and motivation seems to be at its lowest! </span></p>
<p><b>TIP #1: Switch To An At Home Training Program</b></p>
<p><img class="size-large wp-image-7448" src="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_185038762.jpeg?resize=1024%2C647&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="647" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_185038762.jpeg?resize=1024%2C647&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_185038762.jpeg?resize=300%2C189&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_185038762.jpeg?resize=768%2C485&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_185038762.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_185038762.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you know that getting out of bed and stepping into the winter elements is going to be an excuse trigger, make a plan to train at home during cooler months! Some of the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">most effective and challenging workouts </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">only require your body weight and </span><b><i>maybe</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a set of dumbbells or some resistance bands.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A good fat-blasting, muscle-building sweat session can 100% be achieved from the comfort of your home!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adjustable dumbbells, ankle weights, resistance bands, a jump rope, etc., are all things that are inexpensive and can easily be stored in a closet or under your bed and pulled out anytime you don’t feel like leaving the house.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But if you have </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">the right training program</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><b><i>you don’t need any of that. </i></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our favorite </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">at-home bodyweight-only program</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is called</span><b> MOVE. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was designed to help you achieve your fitness goals without a single piece of equipment, and each workout is under 20 minutes! </span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Learn more about MOVE by watching the video below!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you need </span><b>a little extra “nudge”</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to get up and get moving, another </span><b>pro-tip we use</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is keeping some </span><a href="https://sculptnation.com/products/pre-workout" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><b>PRE WORKOUT </b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">on your bedside table. Have it already blended up and chug it as soon as your alarm goes off!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By the time you have brushed your teeth and put on your workout clothes, you will have a nice little jolt of energy and</span><b><i> tons of motivation</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to get going before you have a chance to come up with an excuse! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the bottom of this article, we will tell you about a big end of summer sale happening so that you can stock up on our </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">favorite </span><a href="https://sculptnation.com/products/pre-workout" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><b>PRE WORKOUT</b></a><strong> for 40% off when you use code: LABORDAY40 at checkout! </strong></p>
<p><b>TIP #2: Make Your Workouts Seasonal</b></p>
<p><img class="size-large wp-image-7452" src="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_65703942.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_65703942.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_65703942.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_65703942.jpeg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_65703942.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_65703942.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Embrace the change of seasons and take advantage of activities that you can only do in fall or winter! </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Go on a fall hike and view all the gorgeous foliage.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Try rock climbing.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Walk around a corn maze or pumpkin patch with your family. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you live in a snowy climate, go skiing, sledding, build snowmen with your kids, etc.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Go ice skating.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lace-up your sneakers, go for a walk or run at night, and admire all the Christmas lights and decorations.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are some things you can only do and see during specific times of the year. So instead of missing sunshine and water sports, focus on all the positive things that only come about with cooler temps!</span></p>
<p><b>TIP #3: Try Something Totally New</b></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-7454" src="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_361152601.jpeg?resize=1024%2C514&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="514" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_361152601.jpeg?resize=1024%2C514&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_361152601.jpeg?resize=300%2C151&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_361152601.jpeg?resize=768%2C386&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_361152601.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_361152601.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sometimes a change of routine is all you need to boost motivation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you have been doing all your gym lifts alone, recruit a gym buddy! Try switching up your cardio by skipping your solo runs and joining a group fitness class instead. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another option is to </span><b><i>allow yourself to slow down!</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> If you have been crushing it all spring and summer with intense training and hardcore workouts, </span><b><i>it may actually be time to take it down a notch. </i></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Going full force 365 can cause your stress hormone cortisol to increase. This can lead to a host of drawbacks, including weight gain, muscle loss, poor moods, fatigue, and occasional issues sleeping! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We aren’t saying you should become lazy! But if you have been crushing it 24/7 all spring and summer, your body (and mind) may need to slow down.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Use the next few months to embrace a slower routine. </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Commit to daily yoga.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Focus on becoming more flexible.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Switch to low or moderate-intensity cardio, instead of HIIT.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Try out some bodyweight workouts instead of heavy lifting.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Giving your body a couple of months to recover might even make you more responsive when you decide to kick things up again come spring/summer!</span></p>
<p><b>TIP #4: Stay Accountable</b></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-7457" src="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_266584820.jpeg?resize=1024%2C768&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="768" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_266584820.jpeg?resize=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_266584820.jpeg?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_266584820.jpeg?resize=768%2C576&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_266584820.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_266584820.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><b><br />
</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">The best way to stick to a plan is to have someone that you report back to. This could be a friend, family member, a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">social media community</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, or even a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">coach. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Including someone else, or even just telling someone else about your health and fitness goals and asking them to check in with you to make sure you are sticking to the plan, is a great way to keep the promises you make to yourself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you prefer to fly solo, it helps to create visuals. Make a vision board, create a daily checklist you can mark off after each workout, or keep an accomplishment journal.</span></p>
<p><b>TIP #5: Set A Spring Goal</b></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-7458" src="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_47332240.jpeg?resize=1024%2C680&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="680" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_47332240.jpeg?resize=1024%2C680&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_47332240.jpeg?resize=300%2C199&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_47332240.jpeg?resize=768%2C510&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_47332240.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_47332240.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">March may seem like a long time away, but it will be back before you know it, and 6 months is a long time to make significant changes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Setting a goal is a great way to encourage yourself to push past discomforts and temptation, but there is a science to goal setting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The key to creating goals that stick .. </span><b><i>be REALISTIC and SPECIFIC!</i></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s start with </span><b><i>reality. </i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">You should always focus on one goal at a time and make sure you are being honest with yourself if that goal is really attainable.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you know that your schedule will never allow you to work out 6 days a week, why would you choose a program that requires you to do that?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you know it’s not healthy to attempt to lose 10 pounds a week, why would you aim that high?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you love carbs, why would you go on a KETO diet? </span></p>
<p><b><i>Doing these things will essentially set yourself up for failure.</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Set attainable goals that fit YOUR lifestyle. You can always bump things up if your schedule allows, or you notice you aren’t pushing yourself hard enough. Just keep in mind that being realistic isn’t the same as not believing in yourself or making excuses. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moving on to being </span><b><i>specific.</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The more specific you are about your goals, the more likely you will be to reach them. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It may seem like it’s good enough to say things like .. I want to look good, lose weight, or get ripped! </span><b><i>But you have to dig deeper than that!! </i></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wanting to “lose weight,” for example, is an excellent place to start. But ask yourself what that means to you?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you expand on that and say &#8212; “I want to lose 10 pounds of fat. I will do this by not eating any sweets and doing the V Shred </span><a href="https://vshred.com/sp/move/soc-all/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><b>MOVE </b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">program for 30 consecutive days. I am doing this because I want to have better self-esteem and a head start on bikini season.” &#8212; that makes your goal more specific.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The more specific (and attainable) your goals are, the more likely you will be to not give up!</span></p>
<p><b>TIP #6: Reward Yourself</b></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-7459" src="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/vin_sant_32048508_366936073798151_433609263865135104_n.jpg?resize=882%2C1024&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="882" height="1024" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/vin_sant_32048508_366936073798151_433609263865135104_n.jpg?resize=882%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 882w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/vin_sant_32048508_366936073798151_433609263865135104_n.jpg?resize=258%2C300&amp;ssl=1 258w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/vin_sant_32048508_366936073798151_433609263865135104_n.jpg?resize=768%2C892&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/vin_sant_32048508_366936073798151_433609263865135104_n.jpg?w=1080&amp;ssl=1 1080w" sizes="(max-width: 882px) 100vw, 882px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you have checked a “mini goal” off your list, treat yourself. Knowing that you have a reward coming to celebrate your efforts will make you want to achieve it even more. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It may be tempting to make your reward one of your favorite “forbidden foods” but we never suggest that you reward yourself this way.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You aren’t a dog. You should never reward “good behavior” with food. Having this mentality can create a really unhealthy relationship with food.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You need to eat healthy MOST of the time, control your portions, and see food as fuel. But if you are craving something that isn’t quite as healthy as your grilled chicken and rice, never feel like you need to lose 20 pounds to “deserve” a bite of cake, or nice dinner out with your family. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instead of rewarding yourself with food, buy yourself something you have been wanting. Maybe some new workout clothes, a massage, or an extra $20 bucks in your vacation fund! </span></p>

<p><b>TIP #7: Make Mental Health Top Priority</b></p>
<p><img class="size-large wp-image-7460" src="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_255894146.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_255894146.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_255894146.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_255894146.jpeg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_255894146.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_255894146.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Earlier, we mentioned that cold weather motivation dips may not be your fault.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’m sure you have heard of winter blues. Well, it’s a real thing. Less natural light can cause dips in serotonin, the neurotransmitter that regulates mood.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The dark and dreary days of winter can also cause your body to produce more of the sleep hormone melatonin. This shift can disrupt your body and impact your sleep patterns and overall mood.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are a few ways that you can focus on improving your mental health.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Invest in a light therapy box that simulates natural daylight.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Make sure you are supplementing with or eating plenty of foods with Vitamin D.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Start journaling. There is a lot of scientific evidence that supports putting your thoughts on paper provides a long list of benefits, including stress management, self-confidence, and goal setting. </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Suppose you still find yourself struggling with negative seasonal motivation shifts. In that case, you may need to experiment with taking</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> naturally sourced herbs</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to help support brain health and a positive mood.</span></p>
<p><b><i>Here are a few with some great scientific backing to help boost mood.</i></b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>EnXtra: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">A natural caffeine-free patent-pending botanical ingredient that has been shown to help increase dopamine levels.**It is also one of the first and only natural caffeine-free patent-pending botanical ingredients shown to boost mental alertness &amp; acuity for hours or ending in a huge caffeine energy crash.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Piper Nigrum Fruit Extract:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> A very specific type of black pepper that has been shown to help increase both serotonin and dopamine.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>L-Theanine:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> A powerful amino acid that is believed to help reduce occasional anxiety brought on by stressful situations.</span></li>
</ul>

<p><b><i>BOTTOM LINE IF YOU WANT TO STAY MOTIVATED YEAR ROUND</i></b><b><i><br />
</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you put away the shorts and swimsuits and shift out of bikini season, it’s common for motivation to “fall back” with the clocks. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The seasons have to change (unless you live near the equator) &#8211; so you have to figure out ways to</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">not let your fitness goals go into hibernation mode!</span><b><i> </i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pumpkin spice lattes are only here for a limited time, but getting into shape isn’t seasonal! </span><i>It&#8217;s a year-round commitment!!</i><i> </i></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>The Testosterone Suppression Response: What it is and how it’s holding you back</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>Close your eyes and imagine&#8230;</strong></em><br />
Having enough energy to power through your day with ease … laser focus and clarity to crush everyday tasks &#8230; seeing optimal results from weight training … ridding yourself of stubborn fat … having a robust sex life … being able to lay your head on your pillow and getting a quality, restful night of sleep.</p>
<p><em><strong>Sounds pretty dang good, doesn’t it?</strong> </em><br />
There are hundreds of chemical substances in your body that work in silence to ensure that all of this (plus more) can happen.</p>
<p><em><strong>We are talking about .. your hormones!</strong></em><br />
Hormones are messengers that tell your organs what they need to do and when.</p>
<p>Your hormones regulate everything… from how you think, feel, sleep, build muscle, store fat, breathe, and expend energy… to how hungry you are, your body temperature, sexual reproduction, libido, and much more.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>It doesn’t matter if you are 20 or 70 .. male or female ..</strong></em><br />
<em><strong>hormone levels can become “imbalanced” at any time &#8211; for many reasons.</strong></em></p>

<p>Even young and healthy individuals can experience hormone disruptions. This can come about from poor diet and lifestyle choices, and believe it or not, too much of a GOOD thing can also cause your hormones to go crazy! Excess exercise and diet can even be culprits!</p>
<p>Because your hormones quietly go to work&#8230;<em><strong> it’s not until something seems off that you would notice they aren’t functioning at top capacity.</strong></em></p>
<p>In this article, we want to discuss two hormones in particular and the shocking and potentially hazardous relationship they have with each other.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>NEW HORMONE RESEARCH SHOCKED US</strong><br />
Scientists have discovered a HIDDEN REASON why one of your KEY HORMONES could be low. And why even if you try to replenish it… your attempts could fail!</p>
<p>It’s something we had never heard before and are pretty sure you haven’t either.</p>
<p>Before we tell you about this strange connection and what you can do to help tackle root cause … we want to emphasize why <em><strong>this is something you should address immediately!</strong></em></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>THE IMPORTANCE OF OPTIMAL HORMONE LEVELS</strong><br />
Knowing that your hormones are messengers for pretty much every bodily function, you can understand how having balanced hormones is important if you want to look and feel your best.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, hormone imbalance is a widespread issue, and, more times than not, it goes unnoticed.</p>
<p>Most people don’t realize something is “off” until hormone levels have been changing for a while. By this time, they are already causing a number of unexplained issues.</p>
<ul>
<li>Difficulty losing weight</li>
<li>Excess storage of fat</li>
<li>Changes in appetite</li>
<li>GI Issues</li>
<li>Trouble with restful sleep</li>
<li>Exhaustion</li>
<li>Muscle weakness/loss</li>
<li>Occasional shifts in mood</li>
<li>Low sex drive</li>
</ul>
<p><em><strong>These effects can creep up slowly…</strong></em> making it difficult to even realize your body is changing. They are also often brushed aside as a “natural” result of a stress, aging, or the outcome of yet another failed diet.</p>
<p>We all require different hormone levels. But each of us&#8230; no matter weight, height, gender, sex, or race .. should ensure our hormone levels are in a normal, healthy range.</p>
<p>It takes only a small fluctuation to cause big changes.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>WHAT ARE THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF HORMONES</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Your body has two main operating systems… the nervous system and the endocrine system.</p>
<p>The endocrine system is responsible for secreting hormones into the bloodstream via numerous glands.</p>
<p>There are said to be more than 200 hormones or hormone-like substances in the body.</p>
<p><em><strong>Here is a breakdown of some of your MAIN hormones&#8230;</strong></em></p>
<ul>
<li>Thyroid Hormones (T3/T4)</li>
<li>Growth hormone</li>
<li>Leptin</li>
<li>Ghrelin</li>
<li>Insulin</li>
<li>Adrenaline</li>
<li>Serotonin</li>
<li>Estrogen</li>
<li>Progesterone</li>
<li>Cortisol</li>
<li>Testosterone</li>
</ul>
<p>As stated above, for this article, we are only focusing on two.</p>
<p>We are looking into testosterone and cortisol. The relationship researchers have discovered they have with each other&#8230; <em><strong>totally changes the way we look at “boosting” testosterone.</strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>WHAT IS TESTOSTERONE</strong></em></p>

<p style="text-align: left;">If you are reading this, you need optimal testosterone levels. Testosterone is one of the main hormones responsible for your overall health.</p>
<p>Yes, it is primarily KNOWN as a male sex hormone that is made in the testes&#8230; but women produce and need testosterone.</p>
<p>Testosterone is typically associated with sex drive. It also plays a vital role in the development of muscle mass, bone density, the way you store body fat, and mood.</p>
<p><em><strong>Everyone needs testosterone and no one is safe from declining testosterone levels!</strong></em></p>
<p>There are tons of TESTOSTERONE MYTHS… here are a few we want to bust!!</p>
<p><em><strong>Testosterone is NOT only for men&#8230;</strong></em><br />
Men may make and need more, but ladies, you need this sex hormone too!</p>
<p><em><strong>Age does NOT dictate how much testosterone you have….</strong></em><br />
Just because you are YOUNG does not mean you aren’t at risk for having lower test levels!<br />
Yes, your testosterone levels naturally can decline starting in your 30’s, but this is not the only cause of lower testosterone levels.</p>
<p><em><strong>It’s NOT just some “supplement” meatheads take…</strong></em><br />
Do SOME people abuse testosterone and take a “man-made” version (thinking it will lead to greater muscle gains) &#8211; yes!</p>
<p>Man-made testosterone (an anabolic steroid) is NOT what we are referring to. Your body makes testosterone naturally, and you need optimal levels for optimal health.</p>
<p><em><strong>It’s NOT as simple as “boosting” testosterone levels…</strong> </em><br />
If low testosterone is an issue, people believe that all they need to do is BOOST the testosterone they aren’t creating. So they shell out money products that promise to boost testosterone production.</p>
<p>Sounds like the logical solution, right?</p>
<p><em><strong>NOT SO FAST</strong></em> …. these products can help you support the creation of more testosterone, but that is only HALF of the solution.</p>
<p>We stumbled upon some pretty shocking research that could explain why just <em><strong>replenishing your testosterone levels isn’t enough.</strong></em></p>
<p>There is actually a hidden factor as to why your testosterone may be low, and why modulating testosterone alone may NOT be enough.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>Do you want to promote more energy, better libido, less body fat, and more lean muscle?</strong></em><br />
<em><strong>Then you need to know about this new discovery!</strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>THE HIDDEN REASON YOUR TESTOSTERONE IS LOW</strong><a href="https://sculptnation.com/testboost" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-7235 size-full" src="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_221827769.jpeg?resize=1170%2C635&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1170" height="635" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_221827769.jpeg?w=6000&amp;ssl=1 6000w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_221827769.jpeg?resize=300%2C163&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_221827769.jpeg?resize=768%2C417&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_221827769.jpeg?resize=1024%2C556&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_221827769.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_221827769.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1170px) 100vw, 1170px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">One real reason your testosterone levels have tanked could be because you are making TOO MUCH of another hormone!</p>
<p>Harvard University conducted a groundbreaking study and had a major discovery.</p>
<p>When CORTISOL levels are too high, testosterone levels drop, and any testosterone support you try to give your body may become LESS effective.</p>
<p>If their theory is correct, then <em><strong>it may not be a lack of testosterone that is the issue</strong></em>. Instead, it could be an increase in cortisol that is STOPPING your body’s ability to make and use testosterone.</p>
<p>This means that it won’t matter how much you boost new testosterone you through supplements… <em><strong>If your cortisol is high, all the fresh testosterone in the world won’t matter, because too much of the stress hormone (cortisol) can inhibit testosterone production!!</strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>WHAT IS CORTISOL</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://sculptnation.com/testboost"><img class="size-full wp-image-7238" src="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_243475643.jpeg?resize=1170%2C780&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1170" height="780" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_243475643.jpeg?w=4500&amp;ssl=1 4500w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_243475643.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_243475643.jpeg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_243475643.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_243475643.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_243475643.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1170px) 100vw, 1170px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Cortisol is your body&#8217;s main stress hormone, but it does way more than manage stress response.</p>
<p>It is a “multi-tasking” hormone, meaning it controls many bodily functions…</p>
<ul>
<li>Fuels your body’s “fight-or-flight” instinct</li>
<li>Boosts energy levels</li>
<li>Regulates mood</li>
<li>Controls sleep/wake cycles</li>

<p>If you are mentally stressed out, have an “a-type” personality, do not get enough sleep, are calorie restricted for an extended time, or are training too hard &#8211; <em><strong>there is a good chance your cortisol could be out of range.</strong></em></p>
<p>Your body NEEDS healthy levels of cortisol, but too much can lead to a host of issues.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>THE IMPORTANT RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN CORTISOL AND TESTOSTERONE</strong></p>

<p style="text-align: left;">That study that Harvard researchers did shows us there is an important relationship between cortisol and testosterone.</p>
<p>They work against each other &#8211; and unless you get your stress levels down &#8211; cortisol is the winner.</p>
<p>Too much cortisol can cause something called <em><strong>Testosterone Suppression Response (TSR.)</strong></em></p>
<p>Basically, this means that no matter how much testosterone you’re making, if you have too much cortisol, you will struggle with TSR and continue to have the consequences of low testosterone, even if you have plenty!</p>
<p>Effects like…<br />
Loss of muscle mass .. low sex drive .. inability to lose fat .. poor sleep quality .. etc.</p>
<p>As a result, even if you use testosterone boosters, it may not matter if your cortisol is elevated.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>HOW TO CURB THE TESTOSTERONE SUPPRESSION RESPONSE (TSR)</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Your most important line of defense is lowering your cortisol levels.</p>
<p>We put together a <a href="https://sculptnation.com/testboost">2-minute at home test</a> you can take to help determine if you have too much cortisol. We will tell you where you can go to take that in just a moment.</p>
<p>First, we want to give you a couple of methods to lower cortisol and fight TSR….</p>
<p><strong>Manage Stress Levels (mental and physical)</strong><br />
The most effective way to lower your cortisol levels is to get your stress under control. Stress is not just mental .. it can be any physical stress you are placing on your body as well.</p>
<p><strong>Focus on quality sleep</strong><br />
You need 7-9 hours of quality sleep every single night (minimum) to keep your cortisol levels in check. This can be virtually impossible if your cortisol is high because cortisol regulates your sleep/wake cycle.</p>
<p><strong>These changes are challenging to adhere to!</strong> Avoiding cortisol spiking stressors is pretty much IMPOSSIBLE! We face stress every day. Even dieting and exercising can cause your body to be “stressed out.” And how can you get quality sleep if your sleep/wake cycle is messed up!?</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>Thankfully… THERE IS ONE OTHER WAY TO HELP FIGHT BACK!!!</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>Focus on diet &amp; supplementing with cortisol lowering/test boosting support supplements…</strong></em> There are some nutrients you can take daily that help support a reduction in cortisol levels, as well as a few foods you should try to TOTALLY AVOID.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://sculptnation.com/testboost" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>CLICK HERE to discover&#8230;</strong></em></a><br />
<em><strong>AN EASY and SCIENTIFICALLY backed way to give your body the </strong></em><br />
<em><strong>cortisol crushing nutrients it needs&#8230;</strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>The 4 foods you need to avoid…</strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>A 2-minute quiz to help you determine if your cortisol is high ..</strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>++ More on that groundbreaking testosterone/cortisol study&#8230;</strong></em></p>
<p>Researchers also found that the effects cortisol have on testosterone are reversed when stress levels go down.</p>
<p>This is GOOD NEWS! Now that we know that high cortisol blocking your testosterone IS an issue… we can fight back!!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>In this video, we explain everything you need to know about TSR and </strong></em><br />
<em><strong>an effective approach to knocking it out! </strong></em><br />

<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>THE LONGER YOU WAIT &#8211; THE WORSE THINGS WILL GET</strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Your body will continue to struggle as this testosterone suppression response continues, and it will only get worse if you don&#8217;t take charge and destroy your ability to make and use testosterone.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>Boosting your testosterone is great, but it’s a complete waste of time</strong></em><br />
<em><strong>if you aren’t blocking cortisol too.</strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>We have discovered <a href="https://sculptnation.com/testboost" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">THE ONLY testosterone maximizing method</a> available that is specifically designed to support healthy testosterone while minimizing and balancing the effects of cortisol.</strong></em></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We all share something in common.</p>
<p>Regardless of race, gender, age, or demographic .. there is a worldwide health issue that none of us are resistant to.</p>
<p><img class="wp-image-6993 size-full" src="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_323879183.jpeg?resize=1170%2C780&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1170" height="780" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_323879183.jpeg?w=6436&amp;ssl=1 6436w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_323879183.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_323879183.jpeg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_323879183.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_323879183.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_323879183.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1170px) 100vw, 1170px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>There will be seasons of life that present more tension than others and we all wake up on the wrong side of the bed from time to time.</p>
<p>One or two days of mounting pressure here and there shouldn’t compromise your health, but stressing out more days than not… <em><strong>can take a serious toll on your mind, body, and spirit.</strong></em></p>
<p>The most recent data gathered by <a href="http://www.gostress.com/stress-facts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Global Organization for Stress</a> found that “75% of adults in the United States reported experiencing moderate to high levels of stress in the past month, and nearly half reported that their stress has increased in the past year.”</p>
<p>Stress is, no doubt, a pervasive problem. Still, yet, we tend to brush off the dangers it can cause and continue to live overwhelmed.</p>
<p><em><strong>April is STRESS AWARENESS MONTH</strong></em>&#8230;. an annual time when healthcare professionals and mental health experts from all over the country come together to increase public awareness about the harmful effects stress can have and the ways to combat it.</p>
<p>We’re sure you don’t need a month on your already jam-packed calendars to tell you that we are a stressed-out nation. But it’s great to have a reminder to step back and look at why you may be on edge and examine ways to properly manage (and limit) stressful moments.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>We can’t totally avoid stressors&#8230; </strong></em><br />
<em><strong>but we can take charge of how we deal with them.</strong></em></p>

<p>In this article, we are going to go over …</p>
<ul>
<li>The definition of “chronic” stress.</li>
<li>Ways chronic stress can negatively impact your health and waistline.</li>
<li>How to recognize the effects of chronic stress.</li>
<li>Ways to manage stress before (and when) it consumes you.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>WHAT IS “CHRONIC” STRESS</strong><br />
Not all stress is bad. If you know how to properly manage stressful situations, a little bit of adrenaline can give you a boost that helps you perform better.</p>
<p>Stress is a natural reaction. When our body senses danger, it is flooded with an increase in several hormones. Your “fight or flight” response kicks in. This isn’t negative as long as you don’t STAY in this zone.</p>
<p>Short term stress (also known as acute stress) typically comes and goes so quickly that it doesn’t result in any long-term adverse effects.</p>
<p>Chronic stress is different. This type of stress is ongoing.<em><strong> It is a constant rush of stress hormones that can be debilitating to your mental and physical health.</strong></em></p>
<p>Chronic stress doesn’t have to come as a result of a major traumatic event. In fact, it’s everyday routine pressures that leave most people, “chronically stressed.”</p>
<p>When your “fight or flight” mode stays “on” for an extended time (or kicks in too often) … that is when you are in a danger zone.</p>
<p>Being in constant “panic mode” presents an opportunity for every system in your body to be affected … either directly or indirectly.</p>

<p><strong>HOW CHRONIC STRESS AFFECTS THE BODY</strong><br />
The longer your body is &#8220;stressed,&#8221; the more significant the impact it will have on your mind and body.</p>
<p>Everyone deals with pressure differently. This varies from person to person based on if the stress is “situational” or “routine” .. and of course your personality type.</p>
<p>Our bodies can handle a little bit of stress. But, we are not designed to manage chronic stress without consequence.</p>
<p>Some ways chronic stress can impact your health include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Weight Gain</li>
<li>Mental Health Problems</li>
<li>GI Issues</li>
<li>Low Libido (and other sexual dysfunctions)</li>
<li>Skin and Hair Problems</li>
<li>Developing bad habits (using alcohol, tobacco, drugs, etc.) as a way to cope.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>HOW TO RECOGNIZE THE EFFECTS OF CHRONIC STRESS</strong><br />
Because we are presented with stressful situations every day, it can sometimes be challenging to determine if you are just a little uptight and in a lousy mood, or if your stress has gotten out of control.</p>
<p>The sooner you realize your stress has moved into a “chronic” state .. the better chance you have to avoid the health hazards it can create.</p>
<p>Because people handle stress differently, everyone&#8217;s symptoms may be different.</p>
<p>Here are a few signs that your stress levels have potentially gone from manageable to chronic:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Extreme fatigue</strong></li>
<li><strong>Inability to concentrate</strong></li>
<li><strong>Racing thoughts</strong></li>
<li><strong>Constant worry</strong></li>
<li><strong>Low motivation</strong></li>
<li><strong>Irritability</strong></li>
<li><strong>A drastic shift in mood (always sad or angry)</strong></li>
<li><strong>Digestive issues</strong></li>
<li><strong>Headaches</strong></li>
<li><strong>Tense muscles</strong></li>
<li><strong>Chest tightness/pain</strong></li>
<li><strong>Blurred vision</strong></li>
<li><strong>Problems falling and staying asleep</strong></li>
<li><strong>Changes in sex drive</strong></li>
<li><strong>A weakened immune system</strong></li>
<li><strong>Unexplained weight gain (or loss)</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>WAYS TO MANAGE STRESS</strong><br />
It may seem like you&#8217;re doomed to live a life full of mounting pressure .. especially if your stressors are something you can’t prevent or control.</p>
<p>Remember, just because you can’t avoid stress, does not mean you can’t be better equipped to deal with it. <em><strong>You have more control than you realize!</strong></em></p>
<p>Of course, stress management is not one-size-fits-all. It may take some experimenting to figure out what calms you the most.</p>

<p><img class="size-large wp-image-7021" src="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_283771005.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_283771005.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_283771005.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_283771005.jpeg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_283771005.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_283771005.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><strong>1. Recognize, Admit, Accept &amp; Take Ownership</strong><br />
Stop saying, <em>“I’m fine”</em> and admit that you could probably chill out a little.</p>
<p>If you don’t acknowledge you are overwhelmed, you can’t take appropriate action steps to get things under control.</p>
<p>Every time you notice any of the “stress symptoms” mentioned above, admit you are stressed and take note of what is causing you to become frazzled.</p>
<p>Some stressors are easy to identify (job loss, moving, a break-up, chronic illness, etc.)<br />
In these situations, the best thing you can do is accept that it is happening and focus on the things you can control, such as the way you choose to react.</p>
<p>Other causes of stress are more difficult to pinpoint.<br />
It is easy to look past the actions, thoughts, and feelings that are keeping you uptight. Be honest with yourself, and consider that the real cause of your stress could originate from your own bad attitude, unhealthy habits, or excuses.</p>
<p>Once you have a list of your stress triggers and ways that you are contributing… start looking at ways you can eliminate.</p>
<p>If it’s not impossible to rid yourself of the source, you have to learn to manage the stress it causes.</p>
<p><strong>The next 7 steps will help with that.</strong></p>

<p><strong>2. Get regular exercise</strong><br />
There is a reason that many people call workouts .. therapy. Exercise can provide a healthy distraction and research proves that those who workout regularly are much less anxious than those who do not.</p>
<p>Being active reduces stress hormones and releases the brains “feel good” chemicals &#8230; called endorphins. This rush can elevate your mood and decrease tension.</p>
<p>You can up the “happy” by taking some of your workouts outdoors! Natural sunlight can boost mood and help regulate your circadian rhythm to promote a good night’s rest.</p>
<p>Sleep is even more important when you are stressed out, because tension can cause your cortisol (stress hormone) to skyrocket!</p>
<p>One of the best ways to combat that and keep your cortisol in a healthy range&#8230; is with quality sleep!</p>

<p><strong>3. Meditation</strong><br />
Practicing meditation does wonders for not only relaxing your mind… but shifting your focus from negative to positive.</p>
<p>Making time for your spiritual health can allow you to see things from a new, and much calmer perspective (more on perspective in tip #8 below.)</p>
<p>Find a quiet place and spend at least 10 minutes in the present moment. Allow any anxious or negative thoughts to come in, and then use your personal practice of meditation to release them.</p>
<p><em><strong>Words are powerful</strong></em>. Set positivity into motion by speaking positive hope-filled words instead of fear-filled words. Say it, believe for it!</p>

<p><strong>4. Try Journaling</strong><br />
The simple act of writing things down and “getting them off your chest” has been proven to significantly reduce stress.</p>
<p>Writing down the way you feel helps clear your mind, organize your thoughts, and gives meaning to the things weighing you down.</p>
<p>There is no right or wrong way to journal. Start writing all of your thoughts and emotions, but don’t only use your journal as a way to vent.</p>
<p><em><strong>Keeping a journal is most beneficial if you also make time to focus on the positive.</strong></em></p>
<p>Write down things you are grateful for, and at least one positive that is happening, or could happen, as a result of your stressors.</p>
<p>Include ways you can improve your reactions, outcomes you would like to see, and lessons you would like to learn from your hardships.</p>
<p>It is just as important to be positive in your writing as it is to release the negative.</p>
<p>If you find it difficult to concentrate while journaling, check out <a href="https://sculptnation.com/neuroctane" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this article</a> for some helpful tips to enhance mental clarity. Our brain is continually going, going, going. Like any other muscle, it needs to be fueled to function at top capacity.</p>

<p><strong>5. Breathing Techniques</strong><br />
One of the most powerful tools for returning to a calm state of mind after a moment of stress is incorporating breathing exercises.</p>
<p>These techniques work by activating a part of the nervous system that controls your relaxation response.</p>
<p>There are many apps and methods out there.</p>
<p>Here are two of our favorites.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/lung-health-and-disease/learning-diaphragmatic-breathing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Belly Breathing:</strong></a><br />
Start by sitting or lying down. Take a deep breath through your nose until your chest is full and your belly expands.. then slowly exhale. You should begin to feel relaxing effects after just a few breaths.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=8&amp;v=gz4G31LGyog&amp;feature=emb_logo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The 4-7-8 Method:</a></strong><br />
While sitting or lying in a comfortable position, empty all of the air out of your lungs.<br />
Breathe in through your nose for 4 seconds, hold the breath for 7 seconds, and then exhale forcefully through your mouth for 8 seconds. Repeat the cycle up to 4 times.</p>
<p>Both of these methods can regulate your heart rate, lower your stress hormones (cortisol), and almost instantly reverse the stress response.</p>
<p><img class="size-large wp-image-7022" src="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_94995620.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_94995620.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_94995620.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_94995620.jpeg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_94995620.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_94995620.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><strong>6. Set Limits</strong><br />
One major cause of stress is being pulled in a million different directions.</p>
<p>Stress levels are almost always parallel to the number of items on your to-do list. However, it’s not so much the ITEMS on your agenda that causes stress, as much as it is your attachment to them or fears that they won’t have a particular outcome, or get checked off.</p>
<p>Ask yourself how important the outcome is, then determine what’s necessary and what’s not. Learn to SAY NO to the things that are not essential, or can be passed on to someone else.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><em><strong>Much of your stress is connected to the things that are left UNdone.</strong></em><br />
<em><strong>Instead of a TO DO list … maybe you should have an &#8230; I am NOT GONNA DO IT list!</strong></em></p>
<p>There are other boundaries (that do not involve your calendar) that you can set that will lower stress levels.</p>
<ul>
<li>Remove yourself from stressful situations that don’t directly involve you.</li>
<li>Limit negative screen time (the news, etc.)</li>
<li>Avoid being around negative or easily agitated people.</li>
</ul>
<p><img class="wp-image-7006 size-full" src="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_334496676.jpeg?resize=1170%2C774&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1170" height="774" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_334496676.jpeg?w=6090&amp;ssl=1 6090w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_334496676.jpeg?resize=300%2C199&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_334496676.jpeg?resize=768%2C508&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_334496676.jpeg?resize=1024%2C678&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_334496676.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_334496676.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1170px) 100vw, 1170px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><strong>7. Resist Isolation</strong><br />
Loneliness can make it difficult to deal with stress. The “empty” feelings that come about when we isolate ourselves can also make any stress you are under .. even worse.</p>
<p>It is important to connect with people that make you feel calm, happy, and can offer a listening ear.</p>
<p>Researchers found that social interactions release a natural stress reliever called oxytocin. This is a hormone (also known as the cuddle or love hormone) that is released when people bond socially. It counteracts the “fight-or-flight response we told you about at the beginning of this article.</p>
<p>We would normally tell you to limit your screen time and make IN PERSON connections, but in times of social distancing, this may not be possible.</p>
<p>For now, take advantage of technology and have regular phone and video chat dates.</p>
<p>Use social media as well, but be cautious of what accounts you follow. Delete or mute pages that make you feel any sort of pressure and follow accounts that promote positivity.</p>

<p><strong>8. Shift Your Perspective</strong><br />
<em>“People are disturbed not by a thing, but by their perception of a thing.” — Epictetus.</em></p>
<p>What a great quote and principal to apply to our lives.</p>
<p>Our thoughts are not usually fact. We allow our minds to go to places it should never be.<br />
When overwhelmed&#8230; it’s easy to become negative and cynical. Shifting your perspective and being positive can be one of your greatest weapons.</p>
<p>One study at the University of Michigan tested this philosophy with combat soldiers and found that those that were less negative in their thinking and more hopeful functioned better during difficult times.</p>
<p>When faced with something that makes you feel uptight .. ask yourself …</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Is it really worth the panic?</em></li>
<li><em>How important will this be in a week, a month, a year?</em></li>
<li><em>How will stressing out change the situation?</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Now, take those questions a step further and ask yourself how your reaction can make the situation proactive/positive!</p>
<ul>
<li><em>What can I learn from the situation?</em></li>
<li><em>What is the potential silver lining?</em></li>
<li><em>Is there something within the stressor that I can also be grateful for?</em></li>
</ul>
<p><em><strong>Stress can be debilitating if you allow it.</strong></em> Changing the way you look at the situations you face can be the difference in your blood boiling&#8230; or you coming out of the storm a stronger and better person.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>How healthy are you … really?</strong></em></p>
<p>You may be an ideal weight.</p>
<p>Your last check-up may have resulted in a clean bill of health.</p>
<p>You take daily vitamins, move your body, and get decent sleep ..<em><strong> but are you SURE you are giving your body what it needs to function at 100-percent?</strong></em></p>
<p>How about your gut? Is it in perfect balance? And your mental health&#8230; how is it holding up these days?</p>
<p>The truth is, most of us know that we aren’t doing everything we should do to take care of ourselves. We rationalize and reassure with wishful thinking rather than actual truth.</p>
<p>Now more than ever, it is essential to take a step back and take a long (very honest) look at how healthy you REALLY are and seek ways to be healthier.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>There isn’t a better time to self-reflect on this… than WORLD HEALTH DAY!</strong></em></p>

<p>Every year the <a href="https://www.who.int" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">World Health Organization (WHO)</a> deems April 7th as World Health Day.<br />
A global health awareness day focused on promoting healthy living habits that promote human health and well-being.</p>
<p>When it comes to health … <em><strong>your number one goal should be taking steps to be PROactive instead of REactive.</strong></em></p>
<p>Hand washing, coughing into your elbow, limiting potential exposure to germs, and other common-sense practices are indeed important… <em><strong>but there are other things you must do to ensure you are healthy and provide support to help keep your immune system strong!</strong></em></p>
<p>Our team here at V Shred and Sculpt Nation brainstormed to expand on the “health tips” you are hearing day in and day out.</p>
<p>We hope that the additional information we are providing within each of these tips will help you out during a time where proactive health measures are more important than ever!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>5 PROACTIVE WAYS TO STAY HEALTHY</strong></p>
<p><strong>(1) Get Enough Quality Sleep</strong></p>
<p><img class="wp-image-6950 size-full" src="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_274003412-1.jpeg?resize=1170%2C780&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1170" height="780" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_274003412-1.jpeg?w=5760&amp;ssl=1 5760w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_274003412-1.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_274003412-1.jpeg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_274003412-1.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_274003412-1.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_274003412-1.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1170px) 100vw, 1170px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>We know sleep is important, yet it’s often the first thing we sacrifice to fit everything into our hectic schedules.</p>
<p>Sleep is essential if you want your brain and body to work at full capacity. Not getting enough shut-eye trickles down into every other part of your life.</p>
<p>In terms of immune health, studies show sleep deprivation can impact your immune system, leaving your defenses down and slowing recovery from workouts..</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-6969" src="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/burn-pm-fat-blog-fb-info60.png?resize=1024%2C1024&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="1024" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/burn-pm-fat-blog-fb-info60.png?resize=1024%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/burn-pm-fat-blog-fb-info60.png?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 150w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/burn-pm-fat-blog-fb-info60.png?resize=300%2C300&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/burn-pm-fat-blog-fb-info60.png?resize=768%2C768&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/burn-pm-fat-blog-fb-info60.png?resize=60%2C60&amp;ssl=1 60w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/burn-pm-fat-blog-fb-info60.png?w=1080&amp;ssl=1 1080w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>Being exhausted can also affect your ability to lose weight, especially stubborn fat. This is primarily because not getting enough shut-eye has a significant impact on your hormones.</p>
<p>Your stress hormone cortisol goes into overdrive when you don’t get enough sleep. Excess production of cortisol can lead to some unpleasant effects, including weight gain, inefficient immune system function, and digestive issues.</p>
<p>Your “hunger hormones” (leptin and ghrelin) are also thrown off. Leptin decreases hunger and ghrelin stimulates your appetite. If you aren’t getting enough sleep, ghrelin spikes, and leptin plummets. This leaves you hungry (even if you aren’t) and more prone to make unhealthy choices.</p>
<p>You want to INCREASE your leptin levels. The way to do that is… deep sleep.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>Sleep quality matters just as much as how long you are sleeping!</strong></em><br />
<em><strong>Restless sleep is not fat-burning &amp; immune-supporting sleep!!</strong></em></p>
<p>Your best defense is a supplement that will not only help you fall asleep but get you into that restful deep sleep your body needs to balance these hormones.</p>
<p><a href="https://sculptnation.com/products/burn-pm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sculpt Nation BURN PM</a> does just that!</p>
<p>It gets you into your REM cycle (fat-burning state) quicker and then keeps you there longer. The perfect way to battle occasional sleeplessness. This will support an increase in your leptin levels, lower your cortisol, and put you into a virtually 24/7 fat-burning state.</p>

<p>Many of our routines are thrown off right now. This makes sticking to our usual sleep schedule difficult. It is important that you keep a regular bedtime and wake time to stabilize your sleep.</p>
<p>Our bodies crave consistency… <a href="https://sculptnation.com/products/burn-pm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BURN PM</a> will help you wind down so that you can get to bed at your usual time.</p>
<p>Everyone&#8217;s sleep requirements are different. The general suggestion is to get between 7-9 hours of sleep every night.</p>
<p><strong>(2) Exercise Regularly</strong></p>
<p><img class="wp-image-6951 size-full" src="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_311534671.jpeg?resize=1170%2C780&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1170" height="780" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_311534671.jpeg?w=6720&amp;ssl=1 6720w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_311534671.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_311534671.jpeg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_311534671.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_311534671.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_311534671.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1170px) 100vw, 1170px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>Something else that will help you sleep better and feel better .. is exercise!</p>
<p>For decades, researchers have investigated how exercise affects the immune system.<br />
Most agree that a little bit of activity every day will help maintain a healthy immune system.</p>
<p>You don’t need to live in the gym 24/7 to reap the endless health benefits of exercise.<br />
Simply going for a daily walk or jog can be a great first step.</p>
<p>However, to see the most health benefits, it&#8217;s important to get in 30 minutes of some sort of physical activity every day. A few days a week, incorporate longer exercise sessions that incorporate strength training.</p>
<p>These strength training sessions <em><strong>do not need to be at a gym.</strong></em></p>
<p>Training at home is the only option for many people. And right now, home workouts are something we are all having to adapt to.</p>
<p>It only takes a few small purchases, or even just a little creativity using items lying around your house, and you can build your own home gym!</p>
<p>It can be overwhelming trying to figure out how to make the most of your home workouts, especially if you are used to having access to fancy gym equipment.</p>
<p><em><strong>We’ve got you covered!</strong></em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLIZtutUcGbA2cA3OW88Id6qgaEi2i2rjK" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-6953 size-full" src="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/YT-athomeworkout-GIF-blog.gif?resize=600%2C600&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="600" height="600" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>Over on our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCOFCwvhDoUvYcfpD7RJKQwA" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">YouTube channel</a>, we have a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLIZtutUcGbA2cA3OW88Id6qgaEi2i2rjK" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FREE At Home Playlist</a>.

<p><strong>(3) Follow A Sustainable Nutrient-Rich Diet</strong></p>
<p>Most people see the word diet and picture a plate full of nothing but bland lean protein and green vegetables and believe that is what it takes to be healthy.</p>
<p>You do not need to starve yourself, and you do not need to restrict food groups. <em><strong>Doing these things is the opposite of “healthy” and will almost always backfire!</strong></em></p>
<p>In terms of fat loss, in most cases, you will need to eat in a caloric deficit to lose body fat.<br />
If you aren’t sure where to start, try using our free macro calculator tool that will tell you exactly how many proteins, carbs and calories you should consume a day to reach your fitness goals. <a href="https://vshred.com/sp/survey/survey-aka1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Use our free macro calculator tool here.</a></p>
<p>Just know that reaching your goals does not mean you need to fall victim to a fad diet. These types of eating plans are usually <em><strong>the opposite of healthy.</strong></em></p>
<p>You can still eat foods you enjoy as long as you prioritize nutrient-rich foods that are not overly processed. Focus on eating a variety of fruits and vegetables, lean proteins, whole grains, and healthy fats.</p>
<p>The biggest hole we see in most people&#8217;s attempts to “eat healthy” is lack of diversity.</p>
<p>Even if you manage to consume enough quality fruits and vegetables, you probably stick to the same 3 or 4 that you enjoy the most.</p>

<p><strong>(4) Focus On Mental Health</strong></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-6956 size-full" src="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_318189902.jpeg?resize=1170%2C780&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1170" height="780" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_318189902.jpeg?w=8688&amp;ssl=1 8688w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_318189902.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_318189902.jpeg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_318189902.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_318189902.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_318189902.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1170px) 100vw, 1170px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>The World Health Organization defines health as… “a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being.”</p>
<p>Take a moment today to ask yourself how you are feeling MENTALLY!</p>
<p>A healthy body is not going to do you much good if you do not have control of your mental health.</p>
<p><em><strong>In fact, it may be impossible.</strong></em></p>
<p>Mental health and physical health are very connected. If you aren’t in a good headspace, you will be less likely to start (and then stick) with healthy behaviors.</p>
<p>On the flip side, when you aren&#8217;t physically healthy or have negative body-image issues&#8230; this can have a serious impact on your mental health.</p>
<p>Don’t wait until you are in “crisis mode” to make mental health a priority. Start forming healthy mental habits today that will help you cope better with stress that pops up in the future.</p>
<p><img class="size-large wp-image-6975" src="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_220239371.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_220239371.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_220239371.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_220239371.jpeg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_220239371.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_220239371.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><strong>Here are a few things that may help you out….</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Talk To Someone</strong><br />
Seeking help is a sign of strength, not weakness. Whether it is a professional or a trusted friend, do not keep your emotions locked up inside.</li>
<li><strong>Be Positive</strong><br />
Negative thoughts will quickly put you in a bitter mood. Researchers found that long term pessimists had an almost 20 percent higher risk of dying than those who were optimistic! No matter how bleak things appear, there is ALWAYS a silver lining. Seek the positive and try your best to focus on that!</li>
<li><strong>Find Things To Be Grateful For</strong><br />
It’s no surprise that researchers found that people who focused on gratitude (even as little as once a week) were happier and had fewer physical complaints! One study even found that expressing gratitude may have LONG lasting effects on the brain. Speak things you are grateful for, write a gratitude letter, or keep a gratitude journal!</li>
<li><strong>Help Others</strong><br />
We are hardwired to love! Doing something kind for someone else will leave you with “feel good” emotions that will positively impact your own self-esteem!</li>
<li><strong>Improve Your Life Outlook</strong><br />
Try meditating, mindfulness, positive affirmations, and/or prayer. These practices can provide instant stress relief. Over time, they can help make positive thinking more automatic.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>(5) Prioritize Gut Health</strong></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-6957 size-full" src="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/are-probiotics-the-key-to-unlocking-fat-loss-Blog-Gif-SN.gif?resize=600%2C338&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="600" height="338" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>If your gut health isn’t optimal, your immune system can’t be either. 70-80% of the cells that make up your immune system reside in your gut wall!</p>
<p>Immune support is only one reason you need to place a high emphasis on gut health.</p>
<p>Did you know your gut is the only organ that has it’s very own nervous system?! It has more neurotransmitters than your brain! A healthy gut is crucial for optimal mental health and brain function.</p>
<p>Your gut also houses a second set of genes (that many call the second genome) that you probably didn’t even realize you have! These are not the same genetics passed down from your parents. You have the ability to change these genes. But like the genes you can’t change, <em><strong>your second genome can impact the way your body looks, feels, and functions.</strong></em></p>
<p>Inside your gut is over three pounds of bacteria… known as your gut microbiome.<br />
Many things can cause unhealthy bacteria to populate and take over.</p>
<ul>
<li>Age</li>
<li>Stress</li>
<li>A Poor Diet</li>
<li>Not Enough <a href="https://sculptnation.com/products/enzymes" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Digestive Enzymes</a></li>
<li>Environmental Toxins</li>
<li>+ More</li>
</ul>
<p>Too much harmful gut bacteria and not enough good bacteria <em><strong>can result in serious trouble for your health and waistline!</strong></em></p>
<p>The good news is that you are in complete control and can change your gut flora!<br />
<em><strong>You simply need to feed it&#8230; GOOD bacteria!</strong></em></p>
<p>The easiest and best way to achieve this is by taking a <a href="https://sculptnation.com/products/probiotics" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">QUALITY PROBIOTIC</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://sculptnation.com/products/probiotics" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-6964 size-full" src="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Probiotics-WorldHealthDay-Blog.gif?resize=600%2C600&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="600" height="600" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>We didn’t cut any corners when developing our formula for <a href="https://sculptnation.com/products/probiotics" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sculpt Nation Probiotics</a>. We spent years looking at scientific studies on gut health.</p>
<p>We wanted to make sure we included the right strains in the right amounts.<br />
<em><strong>It had to be THE BEST on the market.</strong></em></p>
<p>The result is a blend that contains 7 different live probiotics, as well as a prebiotic. This is an important combo because probiotics can’t do their job unless they are fed. The prebiotic in our blend is a special kind of fiber that acts as a fertilizer. It feeds the probiotics what they need&#8230; to work!</p>
<p>A healthy gut is essential for overall GI health, energy balance, emotional support, optimal brain health, and immune support.</p>
<p>Take one capsule of <a href="https://sculptnation.com/products/probiotics" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sculpt Nation Probiotics</a> a day to get your gut back in balance! The result will be better digestion, promoting a more robust immune system, and support for an easier time losing weight!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>Prevention can’t be preached enough!</strong></em></p>
<p>The most important relationship you will ever be in is the one you have with your own body!<br />
Take a look at the stay healthy checklist above and be brutally honest with yourself about the areas where you know you need to improve.</p>
<p>Vow that you will begin to consistently incorporate these ”5 Stay Healthy Tips” and encourage those around you to do the same!</p>
<p>Having people hold you accountable, offer advice, and give you ideas to stay happy and healthy&#8230; is a great way to remain positive and stick with your wellness goals.</p>

Often, the topics we avoid discussing are the ones that need to be talked about the most! Sex no doubt tops the list of subjects we tend to shy away from.</p>
<p><em>Whether it’s…</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Having a heart-to-heart with your significant other about your sexual activity as a couple.</li>
<li>Discussing the birds and the bees with your kids.</li>
<li>Talking about your bedroom habits with your doctor.</li>
<li>A chit chat with your friends.</li>
</ul>
<p>Talking about sex <em>(and often the lack of)</em> can be uncomfortable.</p>
<p>We aren’t trying to make you feel uneasy, but research shows that lack of sex is a huge problem in relationships these days, and the trickle-down effect can be devastating.</p>
<p>We know because we’ve heard endless stories. Stories like this one from an anonymous member of the V Shred family…</p>
<p><em>“One day, out of nowhere, it just happened. I no longer felt the urge to have sex. I made every excuse in the world, but the truth was that I didn’t really have one. I wanted sex. I wanted my body to want sex as much as my mind and my heart did.. but it just didn’t. I was in my early 30’s and deeply in love with my husband. How could this be happening? My doctor told me this was a normal thing for women to experience and sent me home. Ultimately, my lack of desire caused me to have severe depression,I lacked self confidence, and I felt like less of a woman. It also caused my husband to have low-self esteem and question my fidelity. Our marriage got a little rocky. Once I finally got to the bottom of why this was happening, I got my life back.”</em></p>

<p><strong>Does this sound familiar?</strong><br />
Today we are going to tell you what this woman discovered to be her issue&#8230;It very well may be why YOUR sex drive is low too!</p>
<p><strong>If so, the good news is that there may be <a href="https://sculptnation.com/products/hgh-boost?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=post&amp;utm_campaign=v-shred&amp;utm_content=Vday-Blog-F-HGHBoost&amp;utm_term=77907521">a SIMPLE APPROACH to getting it back</a>.</strong></p>
<p>First of all, we want to point out that you should NEVER judge your sex drive based on someone else’s. Just like we all have different body types, we are all wired with varying levels of sexual desire.</p>
<p>The best way to determine if your sex drive is low is to look back and compare it to how it was 5, 10, 20, 30 years ago.</p>
<p>If you notice a downward trend in your personal sexual appetite, that is when you have to try and pinpoint WHY your libido has gone from va-va-voom .. to gloom!</p>
<p>Sometimes, low libido is due to emotional distress. It can even solely be because of a relationship issue. But often, the reason desire is low is because some of your hormones aren’t sitting at prime levels!</p>
<p>Sex hormones can be out of balance for a variety of reasons. Age, diet, and exercise habits to name a few.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re struggling from any signs that point to low hormone levels, you should see a healthcare professional for proper care.</p>
<p><strong>But … often your sex hormones<a href="https://sculptnation.com/products/hgh-boost?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=post&amp;utm_campaign=v-shred&amp;utm_content=Vday-Blog-F-HGHBoost&amp;utm_term=77907521"> just need a little boost!</a></strong></p>
<p>Several hormones contribute to how robust your sex drive is, one of the most important is something called Human Growth Hormone (HGH.)</p>
<p>HGH is something our body produces naturally. It is made by a tiny gland at the base of your brain called the pituitary gland.</p>
<p>HGH is what helps us grow when we are kids. Then, as we age, it helps maintain a variety of organs and tissues.</p>
<p>But with age, the pituitary gland slowly reduces the amount of HGH it produces. This can happen as early as age 18, but it really starts it’s downward spiral beginning in middle age.</p>
<p>You may have seen hormone doctors on TV or in advertisements claiming HGH could be the “fountain of youth” that will restore your aesthetics to their wrinkle-free glowing youth.</p>
<p>Research is pretty mixed on if this claim is valid, but one thing most doctors and scientists agree to be fact…</p>
<p><strong>Having lower HGH can no doubt put your body into a state that dictates your desire to have sex.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-6774 size-full" src="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/lowHGH-symptoms.png?resize=1170%2C458&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1170" height="458" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/lowHGH-symptoms.png?w=1640&amp;ssl=1 1640w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/lowHGH-symptoms.png?resize=300%2C117&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/lowHGH-symptoms.png?resize=768%2C301&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/lowHGH-symptoms.png?resize=1024%2C401&amp;ssl=1 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1170px) 100vw, 1170px" data-recalc-dims="1" /><br />
<strong>Here are a few reasons why….</strong></p>
<p><strong>Human Growth Hormone can determine body composition.</strong><br />
A common and well-known reason people don’t want to have sex is that they don’t like the way their body looks naked.</p>
<p>Lower levels of GH could impact your metabolism, how your body utilizes and stores fat, it’s response to insulin/blood sugar levels, and how well you retain lean muscle mass.</p>
<p>All of these things could play a part in how well your body responds to training and nutrition!</p>
<p><strong>Human Growth Hormone is essential for brain health.</strong><br />
You may not realize it, but your desire to have sex begins before you “feel it” because the urge starts much higher up .. in your head!</p>
<p>HGH production is controlled by a set of hormones produced in a particular region of the brain, as well as your pancreas and intestinal tract. This means that lower levels of GH could affect many cognitive functions, such as mental alertness, motivation, and emotions.</p>
<p>When these things are off… your desire to have sex could be impacted.</p>
<p><strong>Human Growth Hormone can help you sleep.</strong><br />
The number one excuse for not having sex is probably .. I’m too tired!</p>
<p>Experts estimate that up to 75 percent of our HGH is released while we sleep. If you aren’t snoozing, your HGH levels will suffer!</p>
<p>Another way that HGH affects sleep is that it can reduce cortisol (the stress hormone) levels. When your cortisol is too high, the quality and duration of your sleep could suffer.</p>
<p><strong>Human Growth Hormone can impact cell regeneration.</strong><br />
Continuing with how HGH can impact aesthetics, slow cell turnover is what can cause your hair to appear thinner, increase the appearance of wrinkles, and cause your skin to start sagging. These are all things that can no doubt leave you less confident!</p>
<p><strong>Human Growth Hormone can increase blood flow.</strong><br />
We aren’t going to spell this one out for you. Just stop and think about why blood flow would be necessary for you to have a better sex life!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>What can you do to give your HGH levels a NATURAL BOOST?!</strong></p>
<p><img class="size-large wp-image-6808" src="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/AdobeStock_298625756.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/AdobeStock_298625756.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/AdobeStock_298625756.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/AdobeStock_298625756.jpeg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/AdobeStock_298625756.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/AdobeStock_298625756.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><strong>1. Get 7-9 Hours Of Quality Sleep.</strong><br />
As mentioned above, our bodies naturally release the most HGH while we are sleeping. If you need some help with catching quality Zzzz’s, you may want to check out <a href="https://sculptnation.com/products/burn-pm">BURN PM</a>. This product is a powerful naturally formulated sleep support enhancer that is packed with both nighttime fat-burners and relaxation &amp; recovery agents.</p>
<p><strong>2. Incorporate High-Intensity Interval Training.</strong><br />
Short bursts of cardio intervals have been proven to improve HGH levels throughout the day. The tougher those bursts of energy are… the higher the boost of HGH! If you need some ideas for HIIT workouts, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCOFCwvhDoUvYcfpD7RJKQwA">we have hundreds of ideas and follow along videos on our YOUTUBE channel.</a></p>
<p><strong>3. Eat Enough Protein (especially around workouts).</strong><br />
Studies have shown that protein can promote increased HGH levels. The easiest (and most delicious) way to hit your protein goals is with our <a href="https://sculptnation.com/products/protein?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=post&amp;utm_campaign=v-shred&amp;utm_content=Vday-Blog-F-Protein&amp;utm_term=77907521">Sculpt Nation PROTEIN</a>. It’s easy to shake one up on the go, but you can also use it to make some tasty treats, <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/pumpkin-spice-protein/">like protein pancakes</a>!</p>
<p><strong>4. Lose A Little More Fat.</strong><br />
Excess fat deposits (especially in the abdomen) have been linked to lower levels of HGH. Try taking our <a href="https://vshred.com/sp/survey/survey-aka1/?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=post&amp;utm_campaign=v-shred&amp;utm_content=Vday-Blog-F-Quiz&amp;utm_term=77907521">FREE BODY TYPE QUIZ</a> to see what diet and exercise may help you blast fat most effectively!</p>
<p><strong>5. Take very specific researched backed natural herbs and adaptogens.</strong><br />
We saved the most crucial suggestion for last. Many people are already dieting, exercising, sleeping, and getting adequate protein, but are still struggling with lower HGH levels. For this reason, supplementing with some very specific vitamins and herbs could be your missing link!</p>
<p>Steps 1-4 are overall pretty self-explanatory. But knowing which supplements to take, figuring out what brands are trustworthy, and then nailing down the proper dosage for each one to even be effective .. that takes lots of time, money, and research!</p>
<p><strong>WE DID THE GROUNDWORK FOR YOU!!</strong><br />

<p>We know, we know! Talking about the birds and the bees is uncomfortable&#8230; But we can’t hold out on giving you this information! READ THIS AND GET YOUR SEX DRIVE BACK!!</p>
<p><em>I have a headache.</em><br />
<em>I am too exhausted.</em><br />
<em>I feel “fat” today.</em><br />
<em>I had a terrible day.</em><br />
<em>I have to take care of the kids.</em><br />
<em>I am too sore from my V Shred workout.</em></p>
<p>We have all had a reason to turn down some bump n’ grind.. getting frisky.. knocking boots.. doing a little mattress dancing. Okay, okay, we’ll stop. We’re blushing too!</p>
<p><strong>But what if (most of the time) the reason you aren’t in the mood has nothing to do with any of that?</strong></p>
<p>What if you are just as frustrated about your lack of desire as your partner is?</p>
<p><strong>You WANT to be intimate with your partner but can’t figure out WHY you no longer have the URGE?</strong></p>
<p>There isn’t a “universal norm” when it comes to sex drive.</p>
<p>Everyone’s sexual appetite is different and not feeling that “spark” can be influenced by numerous things, some of which are relational and emotional.</p>
<p>But many people find themselves in a different situation. Their libido is low and they can’t seem to get in the mood … <strong>but they have no idea why?!</strong></p>
<p>If this is you… <strong>There may be A SIMPLE REASON and ALL-NATURAL APPROACH</strong><br />
<strong>that will help reboot your sexual health!</strong></p>
<p>There is a hormone your body needs to feel frisky.</p>
<p>It’s called <em>Testosterone</em>.</p>
<p>Testosterone belongs to a class of male hormones (called androgens). You have to have optimal testosterone levels to not only have a roaring libido but to be able to lose fat, grow muscle, and function normally!</p>

<p><strong>WHAT CAUSES TESTOSTERONE TO BECOME LOW?</strong></p>
<p>Testosterone levels can take a nose-dive for MANY reasons…</p>
<ul>
<li>OBESITY</li>
<li>HORMONAL DISORDERS</li>
<li>TYPE 2 DIABETES</li>
<li>CERTAIN DISEASE/CHRONIC ILLNESS</li>
<li>CERTAIN MEDICATIONS</li>
<li>STRESS</li>
<li>POOR DIET (including over dieting)</li>
<li>ALCOHOL ABUSE</li>
<li>AGE (After 30, testosterone levels decrease every year naturally)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>WHAT CAN YOU DO ABOUT IT?</strong><br />
To find out if your testosterone levels are in a healthy range, you would need to see a doctor and get bloodwork done.</p>
<p>If you are having any significant signs associated with low testosterone levels, we suggest you make a doctor&#8217;s appointment and get checked out!</p>
<p>But for many of us, our testosterone levels simply aren’t OPTIMAL.</p>
<p>Here at V Shred and Sculpt Nation, we spent a lot of time researching what it can do to the body when testosterone isn’t in an optimal range.</p>
<p>Once we did our homework and discovered there could be a <strong>NATURAL APPROACH</strong>, we sought out to find THE MOST HIGH-QUALITY form of these very specific science-backed herbs and adaptogens. Then we nailed down the proper combinations and dosages that would make these natural ingredients the most effective!</p>
<p><strong>The result?</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://sculptnation.com/products/test-boost?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=post&amp;utm_campaign=v-shred&amp;utm_content=Vday-Blog-M-TestBoost&amp;utm_term=77907521"><strong>TEST BOOST</strong></a> &#8211; A scientifically supported powerful blend that can not only be beneficial for boosting libido, sexual performance, sex drive, and sexual satisfaction .. but also enhance muscle growth and athletic performance.</p>
<p><strong>That’s right, lower testosterone levels may also be the reason why you are busting your butt in the gym and following your meal plan, but NOT seeing results.</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://sculptnation.com/products/test-boost?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=post&amp;utm_campaign=v-shred&amp;utm_content=Vday-Blog-M-TestBoost&amp;utm_term=77907521"><strong>TEST BOOST by Sculpt Nation</strong></a> contains eight different research-backed ingredients that provide a safe, natural, and effective way to refresh your libido and boost your body’s own testosterone levels.</p>

<li>CORDYCEPS MUSHROOM</li>
<li>ASHWAGANDHA ROOT</li>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>LISTEN ….</strong><br />
Don’t you want to give your significant other (and yourself) the gift of&#8230; a robust sex life!?</p>
<p>Heck, forget about ONE day! What about the other 364?!</p>
<p>New research just came out that says that the percentage of American adults not having sex has reached a record high.</p>
<p><strong>Here is a look at just some of the <em>sextistics</em> out there….</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The portion of Americans age 18 to 29 reporting having <span style="text-decoration: underline;">no sex</span> more than doubled between 2008 and 2018, to 23 percent.</li>
<li>13 percent of married couples in the United States report having sex only a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">few times per year.</span></li>
<li>Only 26% of couples have sex <span style="text-decoration: underline;">once a week.</span> The majority do the deed only <span style="text-decoration: underline;">1-2x a month.</span></li>
<li>And get this .. 15 to 20 percent of couples are in a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">TOTALLY sexless relationship.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><em>TALK ABOUT SOME TRAGIC NUMBERS!</em> Low sex drive can affect all ages, all genders, and all relationships.</p>
<p>Not to mention, if you aren’t having enough sex, it could hurt way more than your ego.</p>
<p><strong>A healthy sex life…..</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Boosts Immunity</li>
<li>Helps Maintain Healthy Blood Pressure</li>
<li>Improves Sleep</li>
<li>Enhances Cognition</li>
<li>Eases Anxiety &amp; Stress</li>
<li>Boosts Self Esteem</li>
<li>Makes You More Affectionate</li>
<li>Burns Calories</li>
</ul>
<p>No doubt it has endless benefits.</p>
<p>But in order to want it, you most likely need to have optimal testosterone levels! Having lower testosterone can have many other effects on your brain and body!</p>

<p><strong>Lower testosterone levels can cause …</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Lack of energy</li>
<li>A decrease in muscle mass</li>
<li>Hair loss</li>
<li>Loss of bone mass</li>
<li>Fatigue</li>
<li>Mental fog</li>

<p><strong>DEPRESSION &amp; EXERCISE</strong><br />
Could crushing a workout help conquer depression? More and more research is proving that for some people, exercise may work just as well as anti-depressant drugs.</p>
<p>Whether you have a temporary case of the blues or have been diagnosed with depression, researchers believe that exercise and a healthy diet positively affects the way your brain works.</p>
<p><strong>DEPRESSION 101</strong><br />
Globally, more than 300 million people of all ages suffer from depression. It is also the leading cause of disability worldwide.</p>
<p>Depression is very complex. Doctors and researchers are not clear on what causes it, but they know it can happen in various levels of severity, different lengths of time, and for multiple reasons.</p>
<p>Some factors that may contribute to the chance someone will suffer from depression include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Genetics</li>
<li>Brain Chemistry</li>
<li>Stressful Life Events/Personal Problems</li>
<li>Major Life Events</li>
<li>Substance Abuse</li>
<li>Abuse (physical/mental)</li>
<li>Medications</li>
</ul>
<p>There are some effective pharmacological treatments for depression; however, many people do not want to take antidepressants that come with a long list of unpleasant side effects. For this reason, more people are looking to diet, exercise, and dietary supplements as a natural way to enhance mood.</p>

<p><strong>WHAT HAPPENS TO THE BRAIN WHEN YOU EXERCISE?</strong><br />
It&#8217;s been long known that exercise has numerous positive effects on mood. It not only increases blood flow to the brain, but it also releases endorphins, the body&#8217;s natural anti-depressant, and serotonin, which lifts your mood.</p>
<p>In recent years, scientists have been focusing on researching the mental benefits of physical exercise, especially in those that are clinically depressed. They have discovered that exercise affects brain chemistry in a lot of different ways.</p>
<p>In addition to what happens to the brain and body when we exercise, a structured exercise program can also help those with depression by giving them higher self-esteem, purpose, and structure. It can also be a distraction, allowing a sufferer to have some quiet time away from the negativity that feeds a lousy mood.</p>
<p><strong>WHAT DOES SCIENCE SAY?</strong><br />
There are countless studies on the topic of mood and exercise. Most have found significant improvements when someone with a mood disorder incorporates exercise.</p>
<p>Some studies have even examined if exercise has the same effect on mood as anti-depressant drugs. One found that those who exercised at a moderate level for about 40 minutes three to five days each week experienced a significant anti-depressant effect. This lead researchers to believe that exercise could be just as good as medication.</p>
<p>Decades of studies provide consistent evidence that physical activity not only can instantly boost happiness but even prevent future depression.</p>

<p><strong>ARE SOME FORMS OF EXERCISE BETTER THAN OTHERS FOR BOOTING MOOD?</strong><br />
Researchers have done some studies comparing the effects of aerobic type cardio vs. lifting in people with depression. Most found no noticeable difference in the type of activity someone chooses to do. However, some research suggests that HIIT style training may be the most beneficial.</p>
<p>First of all, researchers have found that even short bursts of exercise can boost mood. That is precisely what HIIT is. A bonus is that HIIT can be formulated to be different every single time you train, which could also keep you from getting bored.</p>
<p>Researchers have also found that strenuous exercise may be more beneficial because it increases the neurotransmitters glutamate and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA.) These are neurotransmitters that are responsible for chemical messaging within the brain. Those with major depressive disorders often have depleted levels of both of these neurotransmitters.</p>
<p>Other studies have found that <strong>HIIT</strong> also boosts a protein called BDNF, which is associated with mood regulation. Low levels of BDNF are associated with numerous mood disorders, including depression.</p>
<p>For an added boost, researchers have found that you may want to take your workout outdoors. Exercising outside comes with the added advantage of being exposed to sunlight (vitamin D), which affects our pineal glands and can further boost mood.</p>
<p>The biggest thing to consider when exercising to fight off the blues is that <em><strong>it has to feel positive</strong></em>. If you are feeling down, you must find an exercise program that you can do without total dread. Remember that workouts don&#8217;t have to be torturous! Try to figure out what exercises will be the most enjoyable, then mix them up so that you don&#8217;t get bored!</p>
<p>Now, if you get anxious just thinking about going to the gym we’ve all been there, don’t worry. Choosing the right program, looking silly doing exercises wrong, having zero clue about which exercises to do or how to do them can be enough to send you into a full-blown anxiety-attack complete with throwing your hands in the air and relieving that anxiety with a tub or two of Ben and Jerry’s.</p>
<p>But before you throw in the towel, remember that finding the correct diet and exercise program could dramatically improve your mental and physical health. Looking and feeling amazing is a great way to give depression the boot.</p>

<p><strong>WHAT ABOUT DIET?</strong><br />
Researchers have long believed that poor diet results in poor mental health and that a healthy diet can reduce the symptoms of depression. In one major study, the dieting group drastically reduced depression symptoms, and more than 32% of participants experienced remission, meaning they were no longer considered depressed.</p>
<p>There does not seem to be one specific diet that works best for managing the symptoms of depression. However, research was performed using more whole foods (specifically those high in protein and fiber) and lower amounts of processed and refined foods.</p>
<p>They found that there are some specific foods and nutrients that may play a role in reducing symptoms of depression.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Selenium</strong>: Low selenium levels are linked to poor moods.</li>
<li><strong>Vitamin D</strong>: A deficiency in vitamin D is associated with depression.</li>
<li><strong>Omega 3 Fatty Acids</strong>: Omega 3&#8217;s are associated with keeping the brain working at optimal levels. This could reduce the risk of mood disorders.</li>
<li><strong>Zinc</strong>: Zinc levels tend to be lower in those diagnosed with clinical depression.</li>
<li><strong>Antioxidants</strong>: Vitamin E, C, and A helps in fighting free-radicals. These nutrients may help lessen stress symptoms associated with depression.</li>
<li><strong>B Vitamins</strong>: Vitamin B12 and vitamin B9 specifically. Both of these B Vitamins are connected to a reduced risk of mood disorders.</li>
<li><strong>Protein High In Tryptophan</strong>: Serotonin deficiency has been heavily studied as a significant cause of depression. Including foods rich in tryptophan, like lean turkey or chickpeas, could help relieve symptoms.</li>
</ul>
<p>There has also been emerging research that discovered that gut bacteria play a major role in mood disorders such as depression. One study proved that probiotics, in both supplement form and from fermented foods, resulted in significant reductions in depression.</p>
<p><strong>THE FLIP SIDE: A BAD MOOD CAN ALSO KEEP YOU FROM TRAINING</strong><br />
If you have ever had a bad day, you probably have fallen into one of two categories. Either you can&#8217;t wait to get to the gym because you know a sweat session will make you feel better. Or that bad mood results in a spiral of emotions that sends your motivation plummeting. You skip the gym reach for a pint of ice cream out of the freezer.</p>
<p>If someone is suffering from a severe case of the blues or has been diagnosed with clinical depression, they may not be exercising because they are depressed. Depression manifests physically, which can result in less motivation to exercise and stick to a diet. This may leave you in a catch-22 situation. You know exercise could help your mood, but being down leaves you with no energy or motivation to work out. This only adds to the low self-esteem that comes with depression.</p>
<p><em>So, what can you do?</em> Here are some tips for when your mood may lower motivation.</p>
<p><strong>Start Small</strong> &#8211; Setting lofty goals may leave you more upset if you fall short. It is best to set achievable goals and build from there. One example of an achievable goal would be walking for 30 minutes a day. Studies show this can help you lose weight, lower your stress level and improve your blood pressure. Walking outdoors exposes you to natural sunlight which helps fight off seasonal depression and boost your mood.</p>

<p><strong>Workout At Home</strong> &#8211; Depression can also lead to social-anxiety making the gym feel even less appealing. But the good news is, you don&#8217;t have to have a gym membership to break a sweat. <a href="https://youtu.be/y1ZKiq5Jql8">Try incorporating this 5 minute at home H.I.I.T workout into your daily routine to get your blood pumping and your mood lifted.</a></p>
<p>If that feels like too much, you can look at your daily routine and consider ways to sneak inactivity. Clean your house, wash the car, do some lawn work or gardening, walk your dog, play with your kids, or even just put on some music and dance in your living room!</p>
<p><strong>Recruit Family Or Friends</strong> &#8211; Exercising with a friend or loved one can make being active more enjoyable. When you&#8217;re suffering from a mood disorder, you may not feel like being around other people, but companionship can be just as important as the exercise itself.</p>
<p><strong>Do Something Different</strong> &#8211; Doing the same thing over and over can lead to boredom and even land you in a fitness plateau. If you don&#8217;t feel like doing your scheduled workout, try something new, and see if that helps.</p>
<p>Remember that you don&#8217;t have to set aside an hour if you don&#8217;t feel up to it. Even a short, 30-minute walk can help boost your energy, improve your mood, and clear your mind. Plus, as you start to move, you may feel motivation increasing. This could leave you ready to tackle a full workout that you thought you weren&#8217;t in the mood to do!</p>
<p><strong>OTHER NATURAL MOOD BOOSTING METHODS</strong><br />
A bad mood can result in brain fog and a lack of focus. Depression or not, if focusing is a problem for you, <a href="https://sculptnation.com/product/neuroctane/">natural mood-enhancing nootropics</a> may be something you want to consider.</p>
<p>In short, nootropics improve your cognitive abilities. This could be anything from focus and mood to memory. Some studies have shown that some nootropics, like Piper Nigrum Fruit Extract, L-Theanine, Alpinia Galanga Extract and Bacopa Monnieri, can naturally make you happier.</p>
<p>Think of nootropics as a workout in a pill for your brain. They can literally make your brain “larger” through BDNF, function faster by improving your cognitive abilities, and stress-resistant, all while improving your mental energy and focus.</p>
<p>While everyone else at work is coasting, you can have nootropics exercising your brain, making it faster, stronger, more agile. Talk about gaining a leg-up on the competition! You can unlock your brain’s full potential, and begin performing like a superstar at the office, in the gym, in the classroom, and in every aspect of your life.</p>
<p>Now, finding powerful brain builders like Piper Nigrum Fruit Extract, L-Theanine, Alpinia Galanga Extract and Bacopa Monnieri can be a real pain. Not only are pure, effective sources hard to find, but they have to be dosed precisely so they can all work together to help your cognitive abilities soar.</p>

<p>Did you know that all of the <em>POSITIVE</em> things you do to get your body in tip-top shape could be having a <em>NEGATIVE</em> impact on your overall health?</p>
<p>Don’t take this the wrong way. The health hazard we are about to tell you about happens to people of any age, weight, or fitness level! This is because the majority of what causes it is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">unavoidable</span>!</p>
<p>Losing fat, building lean muscle, killing it in the gym, and following a diet is GOOD. This information is far from your “get out of jail free card” to stop doing these things. However, what we are about to discuss may very well be THE REASON you aren’t seeing optimal results, despite your efforts!</p>
<p>You see, even GOOD things like diet and training could potentially backfire and create a BAD thing called OXIDATIVE STRESS. This type of stress happens when <em><strong>free radicals</strong></em> and antioxidants in your body are out of balance.</p>
<p>Since we are regularly exposed to <em><strong>free radicals</strong></em>, even if you never step on a treadmill, lift a weight, or follow a meal plan, you are still at high risk for this type of oxidative stress.</p>
<p>In fact, NOT exercising and eating nutritious food can also create a domino effect that could cause you to produce .. you guessed it .. excess free radicals!!</p>

<p><strong>What are <em>FREE RADICALS?</em></strong><br />
We won’t get into some boring chemistry lesson. All you need to know is that free radicals are unstable molecules, and too many of them can damage the cells in your body. Whatever organ a cell belongs to won’t function properly if this happens.</p>
<p>Our bodies are home to over <strong>37 trillion cells</strong> that control everything we do! The health of our cells dictates the appearance of our hair and skin, determines our mood, impacts the gut, regulates metabolism, etc. So you can see how an excess of free radicals could severely negatively impact you .. physically, mentally, and aesthetically!</p>
<p>Sometimes we are the ones responsible for creating this imbalance….</p>
<ul>
<li>Train too much = excess free radicals.</li>
<li>Don’t sleep enough = excess free radicals.</li>
<li>Have an overly restrictive diet and/or inadequate nutrition = excess free radicals.</li>
<li>Eat too many fried or processed foods = excess free radicals.</li>
<li>Stress/Anxiety = excess free radicals.</li>
<li>Smoking = excess free radicals.</li>
<li>Drinking too much alcohol = excess free radicals.</li>
<li>+MORE</li>
</ul>
<p>But there are other ways free radicals are produced in the body that we can’t avoid entirely&#8230;.</p>
<ul>
<li>Exposure to toxins/chemicals</li>
<li>Pesticides</li>
<li>Radiation</li>
<li>Pollutants</li>
<li>Solvents</li>
<li>Secondhand cigarette smoke</li>
<li>+MORE</li>
</ul>
<p>In short, whether you are in our control of them or not, when free radicals take over the body, cells become exhausted and STOP functioning properly.</p>
<p>Over time, what happens next is something called… <em><strong>CELLULAR BURNOUT!!</strong></em></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This creates a host of NEGATIVE side effects…..</p>
<ul>
<li>Fatigue</li>
<li>Lacking Endurance/Stamina</li>
<li>Bloating/Constipation</li>
<li>Low Sex Drive</li>
<li>Lackluster Skin</li>
<li>Brittle Hair &amp; Nails</li>
<li>Stalled Weight Loss</li>
<li>Fat Gain</li>
<li>Trouble Sleeping</li>
<li>Anxiety</li>
<li>Brain Fog</li>
<li>+ MUCH MORE</li>
</ul>
<p>You are probably experiencing many of these symptoms but have been unable to pinpoint the reason why. Now you know, it is most likely because of something you have likely never even heard of .. and that is <em><strong>CELLULAR BURNOUT!</strong></em></p>
<p>To make matters worse, as the body ages, it loses its ability to fight the effects of free radicals.</p>
<p><em><strong>The good news is that it’s not too late!</strong></em></p>
<p>You can fix CELLULAR BURNOUT by focusing on something called CELLULAR OPTIMIZATION.</p>
<p>Your body is a sum of its cells. This means that the healthier your cells are, the better you will look and feel. The problem is that you aren’t giving your cells what they need to be optimal.</p>
<p><img class="size-large wp-image-6652" src="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/AdobeStock_298726227.jpeg?resize=1024%2C768&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="768" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/AdobeStock_298726227.jpeg?resize=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/AdobeStock_298726227.jpeg?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/AdobeStock_298726227.jpeg?resize=768%2C576&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/AdobeStock_298726227.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/AdobeStock_298726227.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>

<p><em><strong>How do we know this?</strong></em></p>
<p>Even the BEST DIET can not provide the fuel our cells need to THRIVE and cancel out all these excess free radicals. Add on all the stressors placed on your body (mentioned above), and a domino effect occurs until eventually your cells stop cooperating and TOTALLY BURNOUT!</p>
<p><strong>So how exactly can you OPTIMIZE the trillions of different cells in your body?</strong><br />
Simply put, you need to replace the BAD FUEL you are giving your cells (stress, processed foods, pollutants, etc.) with CLEAN FUEL (vitamins, minerals, antioxidants, etc.)</p>
<p><em><strong>You may be thinking…</strong></em><br />
<em>“Well, that is easy! I’ll just eat healthily, get enough sleep, and make sure I take a multivitamin.”</em></p>
<p><strong>Not so fast&#8230;</strong><br />
When it comes to CELLULAR BURNOUT, eating healthy, taking vitamins, and getting sleep, just won’t cut it!!</p>
<p>SCIENCE PROVES that our cells need VERY SPECIFIC superfoods in VERY SPECIFIC dosages to thrive.</p>
<p>This is exactly why our team at V Shred and Sculpt Nation has spent years, as well as hundreds of thousands of dollars, to come up with THE PERFECT SOLUTION to beat and treat cellular burnout!</p>
<p>This solution SHOULD cost you HUNDREDS of dollars every single month! We know that isn’t realistic, so we came up with a protocol that will cost you as little as just over ONE DOLLAR a day!</p>
<p><em><strong>WHAT IS IT?</strong></em><br />
It is actually TWENTY-SIX different ingredients including SEVEN SCIENTIFICALLY BACKED SUPERFOODS that studies prove can reverse cellular damage. The best part, you get all 26 of these ingredients perfectly dosed inside a single serving.</p>

<p><em><strong>DO NOT DELAY!</strong></em> If you are already experiencing any of the symptoms we mentioned above, you are most likely already suffering from cellular burnout. You have to take action as soon as possible! The next fad diet, a multi-vitamin, and eating your fruits and veggies is NOT going to work!</p>
