								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3 style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>Thank You V Shred Family: Celebrating 2-Million YouTube Subscribers With A Special Discount &amp; Brand New Workout!</strong></em></h3>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-7394" src="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/ezgif-5-dffd30744146.gif?resize=600%2C600&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="600" height="600" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>We are kind of at a loss for words.</p>
<p>If you had told us in 2015 when we first started our journey to change millions of lives through a health and fitness channel on YouTube  that we would reach<strong> 2-MILLION SUBSCRIBERS</strong> with over 450 million total views and counting in just 5 short years we probably wouldn’t have believed you.</p>
<p>We knew we had lofty goals and knew we would reach them one day, but honestly we thought the milestone we just reached was going to take much longer.</p>
<p>Yet, because of you here we are.</p>
<p>In only 5 years, we have created one of the world’s most popular fitness YouTube Channels and just recently hit <strong>2-Million Subscribers!</strong></p>
<p><!-- instagram error: invalid instagram resource --></p>
<p>It all started on March 2015… Four guys with a vision to simplify training and put the fun back in fitness.</p>
<p>Four guys that just wanted to show people that they can transform their body without endless hours in the gym and rabbit food diets.</p>
<p>Four guys that wanted to help people better their health and build self-confidence.</p>
<p>Now four people wanting to change lives has grown to a family of 2-MILLION from all over the world, and that is on YouTube alone.</p>
<p>We also have millions of social media followers, hundreds-of-thousands of custom training clients in 120+ countries, and have seen more people than we can count transform their bodies using our free YouTube workouts, free body-type quiz, and digital fitness programs.</p>

<p>Or you can skip out on any equipment and only use your body weight!</p>
<p>Set a timer for 10 Minutes and repeat this 10 move circuit as many times as possible without resting! <strong>Let’s Go!</strong></p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='1170' height='659' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/BtO8xt9z6PE?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>10 Min AT HOME Full Body Workout</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Goblet Squat w/shoulder press &#8211; 10 reps</li>
<li>Reverse Lunges w/bicep curl &#8211; 10 reps each side</li>
<li>Lateral Squats w/tricep kickback &#8211; 10 reps each side &#8211; 1 tricep kickback between sides</li>
<li>3-way-raise (lateral-to front-to upright) &#8211; 10 reps (one rep is all three)</li>
<li>Push-Ups &#8211; to shoulder taps &#8211; 10 reps (one rep is after push up, and shoulder tap each arm)</li>
<li>Glute Bridge &#8211; 10 reps followed by ISO hold</li>
<li>Superman Pulses &#8211; 30 seconds &#8211; followed by ISO hold</li>

<li>Mountain Climbers &#8211; 30 seconds</li>
<li>Plank &#8211; 30 seconds</li>
</ul>
<p>You will keep repeating this with NO REST until your TEN MINUTE TIMER IS UP! This 10 min workout will burn even more calories if you use dumbbells or resistance bands. You don’t always need fancy gym equipment or a large wide open space to get in a killer sweat session!</p>
<p>This workout is only 10 minutes so make sure you PUSH YOURSELF!! You can make an excuse, or you can MAKE time!</p>
<p>ONE MORE IMPORTANT THING….<br />
While this workout is great to throw in when you are “in a pinch” and will no doubt make anyone work up a sweat and blast some major calories, when it comes to achieving optimal results, you need a long term plan that you can adhere to more days than not.</p>
<p>It needs to factor in your personal starting point, your end goal, and, most importantly, your body type.</p>
<p>We have a <a href="https://vshred.com/sp/survey/survey-aka1/">FREE BODY TYPE QUIZ</a> that you can take that will take all the guesswork out and show you exactly how you should train and eat to fuel YOUR body!</p>
<p>We know if you are reading this you are probably already strapped for time.<br />
Don’t worry! <a href="https://vshred.com/sp/survey/survey-aka1/">The FREE BODY TYPE QUIZ</a> is only FIVE QUESTIONS.</p>
<p>Once you complete it, you will finally have the mystery taken out of how you should train and eat! So think of this quiz as only a few moments of your day that will give you back hours of time and stress later down the road!</p>
<p>DON’T FORGET ABOUT OUR SPECIAL THANK YOU &#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>We are giving you 30% off your Sculpt Nation order with codE: 2MILL30</strong><br />
<strong>So go stock up on all your favorites before the code expires! <a href="https://sculptnation.com/products">CLICK HERE TO SHOP!</a></strong></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>The Testosterone Suppression Response: What it is and how it’s holding you back</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>Close your eyes and imagine&#8230;</strong></em><br />
Having enough energy to power through your day with ease … laser focus and clarity to crush everyday tasks &#8230; seeing optimal results from weight training … ridding yourself of stubborn fat … having a robust sex life … being able to lay your head on your pillow and getting a quality, restful night of sleep.</p>
<p><em><strong>Sounds pretty dang good, doesn’t it?</strong> </em><br />
There are hundreds of chemical substances in your body that work in silence to ensure that all of this (plus more) can happen.</p>
<p><em><strong>We are talking about .. your hormones!</strong></em><br />
Hormones are messengers that tell your organs what they need to do and when.</p>
<p>Your hormones regulate everything… from how you think, feel, sleep, build muscle, store fat, breathe, and expend energy… to how hungry you are, your body temperature, sexual reproduction, libido, and much more.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>It doesn’t matter if you are 20 or 70 .. male or female ..</strong></em><br />
<em><strong>hormone levels can become “imbalanced” at any time &#8211; for many reasons.</strong></em></p>
<p><a href="https://sculptnation.com/testboost"><img class="size-full wp-image-7239" src="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_220530203.jpeg?resize=1170%2C686&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1170" height="686" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_220530203.jpeg?w=5298&amp;ssl=1 5298w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_220530203.jpeg?resize=300%2C176&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_220530203.jpeg?resize=768%2C450&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_220530203.jpeg?resize=1024%2C600&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_220530203.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_220530203.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1170px) 100vw, 1170px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>Even young and healthy individuals can experience hormone disruptions. This can come about from poor diet and lifestyle choices, and believe it or not, too much of a GOOD thing can also cause your hormones to go crazy! Excess exercise and diet can even be culprits!</p>
<p>Because your hormones quietly go to work&#8230;<em><strong> it’s not until something seems off that you would notice they aren’t functioning at top capacity.</strong></em></p>
<p>In this article, we want to discuss two hormones in particular and the shocking and potentially hazardous relationship they have with each other.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>NEW HORMONE RESEARCH SHOCKED US</strong><br />
Scientists have discovered a HIDDEN REASON why one of your KEY HORMONES could be low. And why even if you try to replenish it… your attempts could fail!</p>
<p>It’s something we had never heard before and are pretty sure you haven’t either.</p>
<p>Before we tell you about this strange connection and what you can do to help tackle root cause … we want to emphasize why <em><strong>this is something you should address immediately!</strong></em></p>
<p><a href="https://sculptnation.com/testboost"><img class="size-full wp-image-7240" src="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_194041962.jpeg?resize=1170%2C565&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1170" height="565" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_194041962.jpeg?w=3500&amp;ssl=1 3500w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_194041962.jpeg?resize=300%2C145&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_194041962.jpeg?resize=768%2C371&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_194041962.jpeg?resize=1024%2C494&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_194041962.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w" sizes="(max-width: 1170px) 100vw, 1170px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>THE IMPORTANCE OF OPTIMAL HORMONE LEVELS</strong><br />
Knowing that your hormones are messengers for pretty much every bodily function, you can understand how having balanced hormones is important if you want to look and feel your best.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, hormone imbalance is a widespread issue, and, more times than not, it goes unnoticed.</p>
<p>Most people don’t realize something is “off” until hormone levels have been changing for a while. By this time, they are already causing a number of unexplained issues.</p>
<ul>
<li>Difficulty losing weight</li>
<li>Excess storage of fat</li>
<li>Changes in appetite</li>
<li>GI Issues</li>
<li>Trouble with restful sleep</li>
<li>Exhaustion</li>
<li>Muscle weakness/loss</li>
<li>Occasional shifts in mood</li>
<li>Low sex drive</li>
</ul>
<p><em><strong>These effects can creep up slowly…</strong></em> making it difficult to even realize your body is changing. They are also often brushed aside as a “natural” result of a stress, aging, or the outcome of yet another failed diet.</p>
<p>We all require different hormone levels. But each of us&#8230; no matter weight, height, gender, sex, or race .. should ensure our hormone levels are in a normal, healthy range.</p>
<p>It takes only a small fluctuation to cause big changes.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>WHAT ARE THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF HORMONES</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Your body has two main operating systems… the nervous system and the endocrine system.</p>
<p>The endocrine system is responsible for secreting hormones into the bloodstream via numerous glands.</p>
<p>There are said to be more than 200 hormones or hormone-like substances in the body.</p>
<p><em><strong>Here is a breakdown of some of your MAIN hormones&#8230;</strong></em></p>
<ul>
<li>Thyroid Hormones (T3/T4)</li>
<li>Growth hormone</li>
<li>Leptin</li>
<li>Ghrelin</li>
<li>Insulin</li>
<li>Adrenaline</li>
<li>Serotonin</li>
<li>Estrogen</li>
<li>Progesterone</li>
<li>Cortisol</li>
<li>Testosterone</li>
</ul>
<p>As stated above, for this article, we are only focusing on two.</p>
<p>We are looking into testosterone and cortisol. The relationship researchers have discovered they have with each other&#8230; <em><strong>totally changes the way we look at “boosting” testosterone.</strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>WHAT IS TESTOSTERONE</strong></em></p>
<p><a href="https://sculptnation.com/testboost" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-7237 size-full" src="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_220530200.jpeg?resize=1170%2C780&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1170" height="780" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_220530200.jpeg?w=4000&amp;ssl=1 4000w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_220530200.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_220530200.jpeg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_220530200.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_220530200.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_220530200.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1170px) 100vw, 1170px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">If you are reading this, you need optimal testosterone levels. Testosterone is one of the main hormones responsible for your overall health.</p>
<p>Yes, it is primarily KNOWN as a male sex hormone that is made in the testes&#8230; but women produce and need testosterone.</p>
<p>Testosterone is typically associated with sex drive. It also plays a vital role in the development of muscle mass, bone density, the way you store body fat, and mood.</p>
<p><em><strong>Everyone needs testosterone and no one is safe from declining testosterone levels!</strong></em></p>
<p>There are tons of TESTOSTERONE MYTHS… here are a few we want to bust!!</p>
<p><em><strong>Testosterone is NOT only for men&#8230;</strong></em><br />
Men may make and need more, but ladies, you need this sex hormone too!</p>
<p><em><strong>Age does NOT dictate how much testosterone you have….</strong></em><br />
Just because you are YOUNG does not mean you aren’t at risk for having lower test levels!<br />
Yes, your testosterone levels naturally can decline starting in your 30’s, but this is not the only cause of lower testosterone levels.</p>
<p><em><strong>It’s NOT just some “supplement” meatheads take…</strong></em><br />
Do SOME people abuse testosterone and take a “man-made” version (thinking it will lead to greater muscle gains) &#8211; yes!</p>
<p>Man-made testosterone (an anabolic steroid) is NOT what we are referring to. Your body makes testosterone naturally, and you need optimal levels for optimal health.</p>
<p><em><strong>It’s NOT as simple as “boosting” testosterone levels…</strong> </em><br />
If low testosterone is an issue, people believe that all they need to do is BOOST the testosterone they aren’t creating. So they shell out money products that promise to boost testosterone production.</p>
<p>Sounds like the logical solution, right?</p>
<p><em><strong>NOT SO FAST</strong></em> …. these products can help you support the creation of more testosterone, but that is only HALF of the solution.</p>
<p>We stumbled upon some pretty shocking research that could explain why just <em><strong>replenishing your testosterone levels isn’t enough.</strong></em></p>
<p>There is actually a hidden factor as to why your testosterone may be low, and why modulating testosterone alone may NOT be enough.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>Do you want to promote more energy, better libido, less body fat, and more lean muscle?</strong></em><br />
<em><strong>Then you need to know about this new discovery!</strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>THE HIDDEN REASON YOUR TESTOSTERONE IS LOW</strong><a href="https://sculptnation.com/testboost" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-7235 size-full" src="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_221827769.jpeg?resize=1170%2C635&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1170" height="635" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_221827769.jpeg?w=6000&amp;ssl=1 6000w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_221827769.jpeg?resize=300%2C163&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_221827769.jpeg?resize=768%2C417&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_221827769.jpeg?resize=1024%2C556&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_221827769.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_221827769.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1170px) 100vw, 1170px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">One real reason your testosterone levels have tanked could be because you are making TOO MUCH of another hormone!</p>
<p>Harvard University conducted a groundbreaking study and had a major discovery.</p>
<p>When CORTISOL levels are too high, testosterone levels drop, and any testosterone support you try to give your body may become LESS effective.</p>
<p>If their theory is correct, then <em><strong>it may not be a lack of testosterone that is the issue</strong></em>. Instead, it could be an increase in cortisol that is STOPPING your body’s ability to make and use testosterone.</p>
<p>This means that it won’t matter how much you boost new testosterone you through supplements… <em><strong>If your cortisol is high, all the fresh testosterone in the world won’t matter, because too much of the stress hormone (cortisol) can inhibit testosterone production!!</strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>WHAT IS CORTISOL</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://sculptnation.com/testboost"><img class="size-full wp-image-7238" src="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_243475643.jpeg?resize=1170%2C780&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1170" height="780" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_243475643.jpeg?w=4500&amp;ssl=1 4500w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_243475643.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_243475643.jpeg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_243475643.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_243475643.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_243475643.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1170px) 100vw, 1170px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Cortisol is your body&#8217;s main stress hormone, but it does way more than manage stress response.</p>
<p>It is a “multi-tasking” hormone, meaning it controls many bodily functions…</p>
<ul>
<li>Fuels your body’s “fight-or-flight” instinct</li>
<li>Boosts energy levels</li>
<li>Regulates mood</li>
<li>Controls sleep/wake cycles</li>
<li>Helps control blood sugar levels</li>
<li>Manages how your body uses carbs/fats/protein</li>
<li>Regulates metabolism</li>
<li>Helps reduce inflammation</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are mentally stressed out, have an “a-type” personality, do not get enough sleep, are calorie restricted for an extended time, or are training too hard &#8211; <em><strong>there is a good chance your cortisol could be out of range.</strong></em></p>
<p>Your body NEEDS healthy levels of cortisol, but too much can lead to a host of issues.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>THE IMPORTANT RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN CORTISOL AND TESTOSTERONE</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://sculptnation.com/testboost"><img class="size-full wp-image-7236" src="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_319140527.jpeg?resize=1170%2C658&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1170" height="658" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_319140527.jpeg?w=7680&amp;ssl=1 7680w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_319140527.jpeg?resize=300%2C169&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_319140527.jpeg?resize=768%2C432&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_319140527.jpeg?resize=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_319140527.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_319140527.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1170px) 100vw, 1170px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">That study that Harvard researchers did shows us there is an important relationship between cortisol and testosterone.</p>
<p>They work against each other &#8211; and unless you get your stress levels down &#8211; cortisol is the winner.</p>
<p>Too much cortisol can cause something called <em><strong>Testosterone Suppression Response (TSR.)</strong></em></p>
<p>Basically, this means that no matter how much testosterone you’re making, if you have too much cortisol, you will struggle with TSR and continue to have the consequences of low testosterone, even if you have plenty!</p>
<p>Effects like…<br />
Loss of muscle mass .. low sex drive .. inability to lose fat .. poor sleep quality .. etc.</p>
<p>As a result, even if you use testosterone boosters, it may not matter if your cortisol is elevated.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>HOW TO CURB THE TESTOSTERONE SUPPRESSION RESPONSE (TSR)</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Your most important line of defense is lowering your cortisol levels.</p>
<p>We put together a <a href="https://sculptnation.com/testboost">2-minute at home test</a> you can take to help determine if you have too much cortisol. We will tell you where you can go to take that in just a moment.</p>
<p>First, we want to give you a couple of methods to lower cortisol and fight TSR….</p>
<p><strong>Manage Stress Levels (mental and physical)</strong><br />
The most effective way to lower your cortisol levels is to get your stress under control. Stress is not just mental .. it can be any physical stress you are placing on your body as well.</p>
<p><strong>Focus on quality sleep</strong><br />
You need 7-9 hours of quality sleep every single night (minimum) to keep your cortisol levels in check. This can be virtually impossible if your cortisol is high because cortisol regulates your sleep/wake cycle.</p>
<p><strong>These changes are challenging to adhere to!</strong> Avoiding cortisol spiking stressors is pretty much IMPOSSIBLE! We face stress every day. Even dieting and exercising can cause your body to be “stressed out.” And how can you get quality sleep if your sleep/wake cycle is messed up!?</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>Thankfully… THERE IS ONE OTHER WAY TO HELP FIGHT BACK!!!</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>Focus on diet &amp; supplementing with cortisol lowering/test boosting support supplements…</strong></em> There are some nutrients you can take daily that help support a reduction in cortisol levels, as well as a few foods you should try to TOTALLY AVOID.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://sculptnation.com/testboost" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>CLICK HERE to discover&#8230;</strong></em></a><br />
<em><strong>AN EASY and SCIENTIFICALLY backed way to give your body the </strong></em><br />
<em><strong>cortisol crushing nutrients it needs&#8230;</strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>The 4 foods you need to avoid…</strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>A 2-minute quiz to help you determine if your cortisol is high ..</strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>++ More on that groundbreaking testosterone/cortisol study&#8230;</strong></em></p>
<p>Researchers also found that the effects cortisol have on testosterone are reversed when stress levels go down.</p>
<p>This is GOOD NEWS! Now that we know that high cortisol blocking your testosterone IS an issue… we can fight back!!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>In this video, we explain everything you need to know about TSR and </strong></em><br />
<em><strong>an effective approach to knocking it out! </strong></em><br />
<a href="https://sculptnation.com/testboost" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-7234 size-full" src="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/ezgif.com-video-to-gif.gif?resize=600%2C423&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="600" height="423" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>THE LONGER YOU WAIT &#8211; THE WORSE THINGS WILL GET</strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Your body will continue to struggle as this testosterone suppression response continues, and it will only get worse if you don&#8217;t take charge and destroy your ability to make and use testosterone.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>Boosting your testosterone is great, but it’s a complete waste of time</strong></em><br />
<em><strong>if you aren’t blocking cortisol too.</strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>We have discovered <a href="https://sculptnation.com/testboost" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">THE ONLY testosterone maximizing method</a> available that is specifically designed to support healthy testosterone while minimizing and balancing the effects of cortisol.</strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://sculptnation.com/testboost" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>CLICK HERE TO FIND OUT FOR YOURSELF</strong></em></a></p>
<p><em><strong>REMEMBER… You need OPTIMAL TESTOSTERONE LEVELS if you want support to…</strong></em></p>

<p>Since the sun is finally shining brighter and temperatures are rising a bit, we want to encourage you to<em><strong> take some of your workouts OUTDOORS!</strong></em></p>
<p>Lack of motivation is one of the biggest reasons people skip training. There&#8217;s nothing quite like surrounding yourself with nature and breathing in some fresh air. It is the perfect motivator to get you moving!</p>
<p>Being outdoors helps lower stress, clears your mind, improves happiness, and according to some studies, can even up your calorie burn a little bit!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>Put on some SPF, pound some <a href="https://sculptnation.com/products/pre-workout" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pre-workout</a> to help you push through, </strong></em><br />
<em><strong>head outside to a nice even spot in the grass, and follow along for this</strong></em><br />
<em><strong>5 Exercise Ab Workout .. that will leave your core on fire!</strong></em></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>The Future Of Fat Loss Revealed (It sounds too good to be true)</strong></em></p>
<p><img class="size-large wp-image-7388" src="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_183074918.jpeg?resize=1024%2C567&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="567" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_183074918.jpeg?resize=1024%2C567&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_183074918.jpeg?resize=300%2C166&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_183074918.jpeg?resize=768%2C425&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_183074918.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_183074918.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>If there was a magic pill that allowed you to not exercise, eat what you want, and never gain an ounce of fat… everyone would be walking around with a six-pack and a slice of pizza.</p>
<p>There is no such thing.</p>
<p>But if some of the top researchers in the world are correct .. <em><strong>there may be a BIOLOGICAL “LOOPHOLE”</strong></em> … that helps support the speed of the metabolism (which dictates how much fat you can lose.)</p>
<p>It’s so effective… <em><strong>they are calling it “THE FUTURE OF FAT LOSS”!!</strong></em></p>
<p>This IS going to sound too good to be true.<br />
This IS going to sound like a bunch of hype.</p>
<p>Because this loophole is NOT a diet plan, a workout video, or anything else you may think of when it comes to burning fat.</p>
<p>We had a hard time believing it too.</p>
<p>But the science on this one is pretty clear.<br />
<em><strong>This discovery is all about how your body, and your fat cells, communicate.</strong></em></p>
<p>Once you change this communication process, it seems that it is possible to <em><strong>force your body to support burning it’s deepest fat stores</strong></em>. You know, the ones that seem immune to hardcore workouts and ultra-strict diets.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>It can all happen because of something called … Simultaneous Fat Release.</strong></em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-7129" src="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_331033280.jpeg?resize=1170%2C658&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1170" height="658" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_331033280.jpeg?w=6000&amp;ssl=1 6000w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_331033280.jpeg?resize=300%2C169&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_331033280.jpeg?resize=768%2C432&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_331033280.jpeg?resize=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_331033280.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_331033280.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1170px) 100vw, 1170px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>How do you promote the activation of your body’s “simultaneous fat release” capabilities?<br />
We are about to tell you!!</p>
<p>It’s crazy!! But once you know how to change the conversation that’s happening between your fat cells… you can finally help alter the way your body burns fat ..rapidly!</p>
<p><em><strong>For real! This hack only takes about 30 seconds to add to your day!!</strong></em></p>
<p>Before we tell you what scientists say the solution is .. let’s go back to the first discovery researchers made .. so that we can better understand why all this happens to begin with.</p>
<p><strong>FAT CELL SIGNALING</strong><br />
Researchers found that our fat cells talk to each other. It’s called Fat Cell Signaling.</p>
<p>Fat cells are not merely big blobs that sit in silence. They are rather chatty and not only talk to each other, but to other cells in your body.</p>
<p>Right now, as you read this, your fat cells are deciding whether or not they are going to put your body into fat-burning mode or fat-storing mode.</p>
<p>If you <span style="text-decoration: underline;">NEVER</span> struggle with your weight… congrats! That means your fat cells are probably having a nice chat.</p>
<p>However, if you feel like you struggle to lose weight, those same 10 pounds keep coming back, most diets fail, or you can’t seem to get rid of “stubborn” areas of fat .. your fat cells are most likely having a conversation you don’t want them to have.</p>
<p>Most of us fall into that second category because our bodies were designed to store fat.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>Chances are the conversation your cells are having over-and-over again ..</strong></em><br />
<em><strong>is to HOLD ON to fat .. not burn it.</strong></em></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-7130" src="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_209544099.jpeg?resize=1170%2C780&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1170" height="780" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_209544099.jpeg?w=5910&amp;ssl=1 5910w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_209544099.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_209544099.jpeg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_209544099.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_209544099.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_209544099.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1170px) 100vw, 1170px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>This means you can do all the cardio in the world and eat an overly restrictive diet but still be holding on to a stubborn layer of fat!</p>
<p>Of course, how much body fat you have will depend on lots of factors (diet, exercise, stress, sleep, genetics, etc.) But your fat cells ultimately make this decision through that constant communication (fat cell signaling).</p>
<p>This new research also explains why some of the most popular American diets don’t work long term. Sorry “keto” and “low-fat” .. science says your restrictive diets DO NOT have the ability to change the way your fat cells communicate.</p>
<p>However, scientists discovered a receptor in your body that CAN help alter this communication process. Once “activated”, it can help complement any “diet” and exercise program you choose.<br />
It’s called the TRPV1 Receptor.</p>
<p><strong>WHAT IS THE TRPV1 RECEPTOR</strong><br />
A professor of neurosurgery, biological chemistry, and neuroscience at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine was the first to discover this receptor.</p>
<p>You have TRPV1 Receptors throughout your entire body. Their main job is to regulate your body’s temperature and energy usage. It kicks in when your body temperature increases.</p>
<p>For example, when you are doing cardio or working out. TRPV1 senses this temperature spike and tells your fat cells to start burning their contents for energy.</p>
<p><strong>WHAT HAPPENS WHEN TRPV1 RECEPTORS ARE ACTIVATED (“Simultaneous Fat Release”)</strong><br />
Now it’s time to tell you about that “loophole” we mentioned.</p>
<p>Scientists discovered that when these receptors are activated, they help tell your fat cells to start communicating differently. They tell them to burn themselves for energy, instead of holding on and storing in places like your stomach and thighs.</p>
<p>This is important….<br />
It means that TRPV1 can actually alter the conversation that’s happening between your fat cells. In fact, they found <em><strong>when you activate TRPV1 Receptors, you can support fat burning virtually EVERYWHERE .</strong></em></p>
<p>The ability to burn fat EVERYWHERE all at once is called “Simultaneous Fat Release.”</p>
<p>This process can force your body to support burning the fat you already have (even your deepest fat stores)..</p>
<p><em><strong>Simultaneous Fat Release can fundamentally transform your body’s relationship with fat…</strong></em> because once you activate your body’s “simultaneous fat release” capabilities.. you can stay in fat-burning support mode virtually all day …burning unhealthy fat build-up EVERYWHERE in your body.</p>
<p><strong>HOW TO ACTIVATE TRPV1 RECEPTORS (simultaneous fat release)</strong></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-7131" src="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_342916350.jpeg?resize=1170%2C771&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1170" height="771" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_342916350.jpeg?w=4802&amp;ssl=1 4802w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_342916350.jpeg?resize=300%2C198&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_342916350.jpeg?resize=768%2C506&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_342916350.jpeg?resize=1024%2C675&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_342916350.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_342916350.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1170px) 100vw, 1170px" data-recalc-dims="1" /><br />
As mentioned, one way to activate the TRPV1 Receptors is through super-intense workouts.<br />
But scientists have found that we can also activate our TRV1 Receptors another way.</p>
<p>They discovered that these receptors can also be activated by eating a common spice found in red chili peppers. It’s called Capsaicin.</p>
<p>Over the years, NUMEROUS studies have been done on the effectiveness of Capsaicin.</p>
<p><em><strong>Here are the findings of only A FEW ….</strong></em></p>
<ul>
<li>“Capsaicin was found to enhance energy expenditure and fat burning in humans, particularly those with a high Body Mass Index (BMI.)”</li>
<li>“Participants in the Capsaicin group saw a significant decrease in stomach fat when used as part of a weight management program.”</li>
<li>“The Capsaicin group lost nearly double the weight of the placebo group.”</li>
<li>“The Capsaicin group increased their body’s fat-burning potential by up to 46.4% when used daily for 8 weeks, while the placebo group saw no improvement at all.”</li>
<li>“Capsaicin activates TRPV1 Receptors and significantly increases metabolism and fat burning potential.”</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>OF COURSE, it’s not as easy as eating some red chili peppers!!</strong></em></p>
<p>All of the studies mentioned used a Capsaicin supplement. That is because the amount of chili peppers needed to activate your TRPV1 receptors is very high. It would make you physically sick if you attempted to EAT that many chili peppers (don&#8217;t do that.)</p>
<p>With a supplement, you can safely consume Capsaicin at a much higher quantity.</p>
<p>BEFORE YOU EXIT THIS ARTICLE and attempt to “google” Capsaicin ..<em><strong> there is something very important you need to know about this spice.</strong></em></p>
<p>The supplement form of Capsaicin isn’t hard to find. However, it can vary dramatically both in quality and effectiveness.</p>
<p>You have to ensure that the Capsaicin you choose is time-released and has a special coating.</p>
<p>For that reason, there’s only one form of Capsaicin that we stand behind. <em><strong>This specific formula of Capsaicin has already helped over 1.2 Million people (and counting) finally lose fat and help keep it off when combined with diet and exercise!</strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>THIS FORM OF CAPSAICIN is in high demand &#8211; but very limited supply.</strong></em></p>
<p>Only a select group of supplement manufacturers can get access to this specific form of Capsaicin.</p>
<p>Whether you are making progress but can’t seem to blast that last bit of fat, or are just getting started and have a long way to go, you can provide support to help SPEED UP fat loss once you tell your fat cells how to communicate with each other!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>Learn more about this scientific discovery and the one of a kind formula that changes the way your body both burns and holds on to stubborn fat….</strong></em></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>Eating healthy on Cinco de Mayo Is Easier Than You Think</strong></em></p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-7080 aligncenter" src="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/CDM-blog-01-fb-vs.gif?resize=600%2C600&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="600" height="600" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>It is time for the ultimate #TacoTuesday … Cinco de Mayo 2020 is upon us!</p>
<p>If you are on a diet (or just trying not to gain the “Quarantine 15”) … you may think that a fiesta of tacos, tortillas, and tequila is off-limits.</p>
<p>No doubt, many standard Mexican dishes are full of calories, which could easily result in a dieting disaster!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>But you don&#8217;t have to skip the Cinco de Mayo festivities.</strong></em></p>
<p>Without all of the oils, sauces, and cheese, most of the ingredients that make up your favorite Mexican dishes are very waistline-friendly.</p>
<ul>
<li>Lean Meat</li>
<li>Fiber-Rich Beans</li>
<li>Rice</li>
<li>Vegetables</li>
<li>Salsa</li>
<li>Avocado</li>
<li>Herbs and Spices (like cilantro, chile peppers, etc.)</li>
</ul>
<p>The base for most Mexican cuisine is very diet-friendly! Which makes modifying your Cinco de Mayo spread super easy!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>Grab your sombrero…</strong></em><br />
<em><strong>We’ve got a Cinco de Mayo menu that will allow you to</strong></em><br />
<em><strong>enjoy the festivities and stay on track!</strong></em></p>
<p>Before we give you TEN different macro-friendly recipes, here is a Cinco de Mayo FUN FACT for ya … in case you want to impress your fiesta crew!</p>
<p><em><strong>Did you know</strong></em>… Cinco de Mayo (Spanish for “5th of May”) is not a Mexican holiday?<br />
Many people confuse it with Mexican Independence Day (that isn’t until September.)</p>
<p>Cinco de Mayo is actually a day that commemorates the Battle of Puebla when the Mexican army had victory over France during the Franco-Mexican War.</p>
<p>Except for the city of Puebla, where they celebrate with a military parade and mock battle, Cinco celebrations are pretty low-key in Mexico.</p>
<p>Americans, however, use the day as an excuse to eat tacos, bottomless bowls of chips and salsa and pound pitchers of margaritas!</p>
<p>I mean, we aren’t complaining… any excuse for some tacos and tequila, right?</p>
<p>Enough history&#8230; let the fiesta begin!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>HEALTHY CINCO MAIN DISHES</strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>LOW CARB FISH TACO BOWL</strong></span><br />
This bowl reminds us of a sunny day at the beach! It is so flavorful that you won’t even miss the carb-filled tortilla! We are using white fish, but you can substitute grilled chicken, salmon, or shrimp!</p>

<p>There really isn’t a special recipe here (however we are gonna give you one for some inspo.)</p>
<p>All you do is think of what you love in and on a burrito .. and throw it in a bowl instead of wrapping it in a carb-heavy flour tortilla!</p>
<p>With all the flavors and volume, you won’t miss the carbs! Plus, skipping out on rice or a tortilla means you save calories for an extra Skinny Margarita instead (recipe for that is below.)</p>
<p>Get creative and use your favorite lean protein, veggies, and garnishes!<br />
Here is how we like to make our bowl ….</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Bowl Ingredients:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Lean meat of choice (grilled chicken, lean shredded pork, lean steak, fish, shrimp, etc.)</li>
<li>Lots of shredded lettuce</li>
<li>Steamed cilantro lime rice, cauliflower rice, or quinoa.</li>
<li>Sauteed Fajita Veggies</li>
<li>Fajita Seasoning</li>
<li>Black Beans</li>
<li>Corn</li>
<li>Salsa</li>
<li>Pico</li>
<li>Guac</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Bowl Instructions:</span></p>
<p>Make your meat however you choose using seasonings that compliment Mexican fare!<br />
We are using a lean sirloin steak rubbed with a cilantro lime seasoning.</p>
<p>Make your steamed rice, cauli rice, or quinoa (add lime, cilantro, and salt for extra flavor.)</p>
<p>Sautee Veggies (we are using olive oil cooking spray, peppers, onions, and mushrooms)</p>
<p>Crack open a can of corn and black beans and heat them up on the stove or microwave.</p>
<p>Put a ton of shredded lettuce in a big bowl. Mix in some salsa, lime juice, and seasoning to give your lettuce a little extra flavor. Pile in all your ingredients. Mix up. Top with garnishes of choice…. dig in!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>SOUTHWEST CHICKEN QUESADILLAS</strong></span><br />
Typically we would tell you that a quesadilla should be a hard pass. At a restaurant, this carb-heavy menu staple is fried in oil and filled with hundreds of calories of cheese, with very little (and sometimes no) protein and veggies. But it is easy to give this typically high-calorie Mexican staple a healthy upgrade at home!</p>

<ul>
<li>10 oz Raw Chicken Breast</li>

<li>2 tbsp minced garlic</li>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Instructions:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>Spray a non-stick skillet with spray and heat on medium-high</li>
<li>Saute 1 tbsp minced garlic and onions. Add chicken (thinly sliced) and cook about 12-15 minutes or until fully cooked.</li>
<li>Spread hummus onto each of your tortillas.</li>
<li>On one side of your tortillas &#8211; evenly distribute your cooked chicken mixture, black beans, goat cheese, sliced avocado, and some fresh chopped cilantro.</li>
<li>Fold tortillas in half.</li>
<li>Spray skillet with oil and allow skillet to heat to medium heat.</li>

</ol>
<p>Top with salsa and dip in greek yogurt!</p>
<p><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">** TIP **</span></em><br />
If you don’t like plain greek yogurt, try mixing in some lime juice, taco seasonings, smashed avocado, or even some low sugar ketchup (yes ketchup, don’t knock it till you try it.)</p>

<p>One of the quickest ways to eat a TON of calories in no time&#8230; is with chips and dips!</p>
<p>For “chips” … there are lots of baked versions you can purchase. But if you want to make your own tortilla chips, it is super simple!</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Tortilla Chip Ingredients:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Corn tortillas</li>
<li>Olive or Avocado Oil Spray (or a tiny bit of the actual oil)</li>
<li>Salt</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Tortilla Chip Instructions:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Heat oven to 350 degrees.</li>
<li>Cut corn tortillas into triangles.</li>
<li>Spray or lightly brush with oil.</li>
<li>Sprinkle on some salt.</li>
<li>Place on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper and bake about 10 minutes, or until crispy!</li>
</ul>
<p><em><strong>If you want to save some carbs, a great alternative to chips would be fresh veggies, like peppers, celery, and zucchini!</strong></em></p>
<p>For “dips”… salsa is always a safe choice, especially if you make your own at home.</p>
<p>Guacamole is another popular choice. While guac is made with healthy avocados, it is easy to overeat this delicious chip dipper!</p>
<p>But with a simple recipe trick, you can easily add “bulk” to your guacamole so you can<br />
enjoy more&#8230; for less!</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Skinny Guacamole Ingredients:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>1 large ripe avocado</li>
<li>1/4 cup coarsely chopped fresh cilantro</li>
<li>1/4 cup finely chopped onion</li>
<li>2 cloves garlic</li>
<li>2 tablespoons lime juice</li>
<li>1/2 teaspoon hot sauce</li>
<li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
<li>1 large zucchini cut into chunks OR 1 cup steamed peas</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Skinny Guacamole Instructions:</span></p>
<p>(zucchini version)</p>
<ul>
<li>Place the chopped zucchini in a microwave-safe bowl and cover with a damp paper towel. Microwave on high until tender (3-5 minutes.)</li>
<li>Drain any liquid by pressing lightly on the zucchini.</li>
<li>Let cool for about 5 minutes.</li>
<li>Add avocado, cilantro, onion, garlic, lime juice, hot sauce, and salt. Mash with a fork until combined.</li>
</ul>
<p>(pea version) *using peas will make the guac slightly sweeter*</p>
<ul>
<li>Lightly steam peas. Allow to cool and then mash by hand or place in a food processor and pulse until the peas are smooth.</li>
<li>Transfer peas into a large bowl and add the rest of the guacamole ingredients above, minus the zucchini (Adding both could work too. More veggies is never a bad thing.)</li>
<li>Mix well, mashing the avocado as you stir.</li>
</ul>

<p>Also known as Elote, this delicious corn dish was given the nickname “Mexican Street Corn” because it is a staple for street vendors in Mexico.</p>
<p>You can get fancy and make/serve it on a stick like they do .. or skip the stick .. and place it straight on the grill. If you don’t have a grill, you can also make the corn in the oven.<br />
Can’t find corn on the cob? Use canned or frozen corn, mix in the other ingredients, and serve it off the cob!</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Ingredients:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>4 medium corn on the cob (husked and silk removed)</li>
<li>¼ cup light or fat free mayonnaise</li>
<li>¼ cup fresh chopped cilantro</li>
<li>2 tbsp plain fat free greek yogurt</li>
<li>1 tsp fresh lime juice</li>
<li>1 tsp</li>
<li>½ tsp ancho chile powder</li>
<li>¼ tsp minced garlic</li>
<li>4 Tbsp cotija cheese (Can sub crumbled fat free feta for an even healthier version, see notes)</li>
<li>Olive oil cooking spray</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Instructions</span></p>
<ol>
<li>Preheat grill to medium.</li>
<li>Lightly spray corn with cooking spray.</li>
<li>Place corn on the grill, turning occasionally.</li>
<li>Cook until tender and slightly charred (10-15 minutes.)</li>
<li>While the corn is on the grill, combine all ingredients except the cheese in a small bowl.</li>
<li>When corn is ready, brush with the mixture and then sprinkle each ear with 1 Tbsp cheese. Add a few more shakes of chili powder for an extra kick!</li>
</ol>
<p>*While they both have a similar texture and mild salty flavor, feta cheese will not taste the same as cotija. Because feta is easy to find and comes in a fat free variety, it is a decent substitute that could serve as a lower-calorie option. Grated parmesan cheese could also be a substitute.</p>

<p>Mexican sangria is a traditional Spanish beverage that combines wine, fruit, sugar, and some spices. It is known to have a slightly higher alcohol content than Spanish sangria and pairs well with spicy foods!</p>

1 scoop <a href="https://sculptnation.com/products/bcaas" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sculpt Nation Fruit Punch BCAAs</a><br />
1 cup fruit of choice (examples: sliced blood oranges, sliced peaches, raspberries, strawberries, blueberries, etc. We love the combo of oranges, peaches, and strawberries.)<br />
4 oz diet ginger ale<br />
8 oz water</p>
<p>Instructions:<br />
Add water, a scoop of <a href="https://sculptnation.com/products/bcaas" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sculpt Nation BCAAs</a>, fruit, and ginger ale (in this order) to a shaker cup. Shake up and serve chilled!</p>
<p><em><strong>Why BCAAs?</strong></em><br />
For starters, they are delicious and add flavor to your drink for no added calories (you can’t say the same with typical fruit juices or sangria mixes.)</p>
<p>But they can also provide tons of recovery benefits! So if you take us up on our Cinco Tips (below) and get in a good training session before your fiesta… <em><strong>this Sangria recipe would be a great post-workout drink!</strong></em></p>
<p><a href="https://sculptnation.com/products/bcaas" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BCAAs</a> (or branched-chain amino acids) assist in helping you recover from your training sessions much faster. They provide exactly what your body needs to support getting into an anabolic state (muscle building and fat burning) &#8211; and help repair the damage training causes to your muscle fibers. <em><strong>Quicker recovery means&#8230; less muscle soreness!</strong></em></p>
<p>Faster recovery is only one perk of supplementing with <a href="https://sculptnation.com/products/bcaas" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">quality BCAAs</a>. The essential amino acids in our <a href="https://sculptnation.com/products/bcaas" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sculpt Nation blend</a> have been shown to assist with and support&#8230;</p>
<ul>
<li>Adding Lean Muscle</li>
<li>Increasing Fat Burn</li>
<li>Enhancing Endurance</li>
<li>Maintaining muscle when in a calorie deficit</li>
</ul>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>If none of these recipes entice your taste buds… there are plenty of healthy swaps you can make that will allow you to stick to your diet…</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>Here are some tips!</strong></em></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>ENJOY</strong></span><br />
<strong>Fresh Veggies</strong>: No limit here! Veggies are a great way to add “bulk” to your Cinco dishes. Just don’t cook them in a ton of oil. Steam or saute with cooking spray!</p>
<p><strong>Lean Meats</strong>: grilled chicken, white fish, shrimp, and even lean shredded pork loin! Load up on lean protein.</p>
<p><strong>Salsa</strong>: This condiment adds tons of flavor to your food and is very low in calories and carbs.<br />
If you are watching sodium, many store-bought salsas are super high in sodium! You can always make you own!</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">LIMIT</span></strong><br />
<strong>Tortillas</strong>: Opt for “thin” or mini street size tortillas. Another option is to mix things up. Have 1-2 tortillas, and for the rest of your tacos, use a lettuce wrap instead!</p>
<p><strong>Rice</strong>: Nothing wrong with rice! Just be mindful. This small grain can add up to some significant carbs! Also, pass on rice cooked in oil and use steamed rice flavored with things like lime juice and cilantro! If you want to add bulk to your rice, do a 50/50 mix of rice and cauli rice!</p>
<p><strong>Guacamole</strong>: Avocados are very healthy! But it can be easy to eat a full day’s worth of fat in one sitting of chips &amp; guac if you aren&#8217;t careful! Remember that even “healthy” foods have calories! If you want more “bulk,” try our lower fat guac recipe above.</p>
<p><strong>Fruit Based Salsa</strong>: This is another example of how healthy foods still have calories. There is nothing wrong with fruit, but keep in mind fruit based salsas do have more carbs.</p>
<p><strong>Low-Fat Cheese</strong>: The same rule applies here! Just be mindful! A sprinkle can go a long way in adding flavor to your dishes!</p>
<p><strong>Beans</strong>: This is another super healthy food that we encourage you to add to your dishes! Just keep in mind that beans do have a decent amount of both protein and fat and not ALL beans are healthy (skip the refried.)</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>PASS</strong></span><br />
<strong>Full Fat Cheese</strong>: Things like queso dip, etc.</p>
<p><strong>Anything Fried</strong>: Eat black beans instead of refried beans. Baked chips instead of fried chips. Soft flour or corn tortillas instead of crispy taco shells.</p>
<p><strong>Fattier Cuts Of Meat</strong>: Many Mexican restaurants use fatty cuts of beef, chicken thighs instead of breast, and pork shoulder instead of a leaner loin. Make sure you are using lean cuts of meat for your dishes.</p>
<p><strong>Sugary Pre-Mixed Drinks</strong>: Of course, alcohol has calories, but so do the sugary mixes you use to make your favorite margarita! Skip the pre-made mixes, or things like triple sec, and make your own using our recipe above. You should use caution with alcohol in general. It’s not just the “empty” calories in the drinks themselves, it’s also the temptation to make bad decisions after a few drinks kick in!</p>
<p><strong>OTHER TIPS</strong><br />
If you are going to support your local Mexican restaurant, when you order, you can make a few special requests to make your meal healthier!</p>
<p>Ask them to steam your vegetables, use light or no oil when cooking, pass on the cheese and refried beans, get ALL sauces on the side and use them in moderation, ask for lettuce wraps instead of tortillas, skip their rice (unless it’s steamed) and add your own at home, and instead of having them include their fried tortilla chips .. make your own using our recipe above.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Healthy or Modified…</em></strong><br />
<em>Make sure you put those calories to good use and get in a pre-Cinco lift!!</em><br />
<em>If you need some ideas, we have hundreds (for free) on our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/vshred" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">YouTube channel</a>!</em></p>
<p>If you decide to indulge and eat some non-modified fiesta foods, here are a few more ways you can lessen the “damage” from all the extra calories you consume!</p>
<ul>
<li>Plan your fiesta to be a “High Carb Day” &#8211; “Free Meal” &#8211; “ReFeed Day” &#8211; etc.</li>
<li>Plan your training split so that you work one of your lagging/larger body parts and get in a solid lift and cardio session before you indulge!</li>
<li>Go on a pre and post-meal walk to increase your daily <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12468415" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NEAT</a>.</li>
<li>Include a fat-burning thermogenic support supplement like <a href="https://sculptnation.com/products/burn">Sculpt Nation BURN</a> that helps naturally suppress appetite!</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://sculptnation.com/products/burn" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BURN</a> is different from many “fat burners” on the market. It’s so unique, we don’t even like to call it that. Most fat burners may help you burn a few extra calories, but it ends there. Any fat that is mobilized may still be in your blood waiting for a new place to live (like your stomach or thighs.)</p>
<p><a href="https://sculptnation.com/products/burn" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BURN</a> goes further .. it attacks your body fat from three essential pathways.. blasting fat cells from the inside out.</p>
<p>Even if you are choosing to lighten up your fiesta, <a href="https://sculptnation.com/products/burn" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BURN</a> is a great addition to your supplement stack because it goes beyond helping you burn calories. It helps support and raise your metabolic rate! Increasing your metabolic rate helps boost your body’s ability to burn fat for fuel!</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We all share something in common.</p>
<p>Regardless of race, gender, age, or demographic .. there is a worldwide health issue that none of us are resistant to.</p>
<p><img class="wp-image-6993 size-full" src="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_323879183.jpeg?resize=1170%2C780&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1170" height="780" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_323879183.jpeg?w=6436&amp;ssl=1 6436w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_323879183.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_323879183.jpeg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_323879183.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_323879183.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_323879183.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1170px) 100vw, 1170px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>There will be seasons of life that present more tension than others and we all wake up on the wrong side of the bed from time to time.</p>
<p>One or two days of mounting pressure here and there shouldn’t compromise your health, but stressing out more days than not… <em><strong>can take a serious toll on your mind, body, and spirit.</strong></em></p>
<p>The most recent data gathered by <a href="http://www.gostress.com/stress-facts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Global Organization for Stress</a> found that “75% of adults in the United States reported experiencing moderate to high levels of stress in the past month, and nearly half reported that their stress has increased in the past year.”</p>
<p>Stress is, no doubt, a pervasive problem. Still, yet, we tend to brush off the dangers it can cause and continue to live overwhelmed.</p>
<p><em><strong>April is STRESS AWARENESS MONTH</strong></em>&#8230;. an annual time when healthcare professionals and mental health experts from all over the country come together to increase public awareness about the harmful effects stress can have and the ways to combat it.</p>
<p>We’re sure you don’t need a month on your already jam-packed calendars to tell you that we are a stressed-out nation. But it’s great to have a reminder to step back and look at why you may be on edge and examine ways to properly manage (and limit) stressful moments.</p>

<p><strong>WHAT IS “CHRONIC” STRESS</strong><br />
Not all stress is bad. If you know how to properly manage stressful situations, a little bit of adrenaline can give you a boost that helps you perform better.</p>
<p>Stress is a natural reaction. When our body senses danger, it is flooded with an increase in several hormones. Your “fight or flight” response kicks in. This isn’t negative as long as you don’t STAY in this zone.</p>
<p>Short term stress (also known as acute stress) typically comes and goes so quickly that it doesn’t result in any long-term adverse effects.</p>
<p>Chronic stress is different. This type of stress is ongoing.<em><strong> It is a constant rush of stress hormones that can be debilitating to your mental and physical health.</strong></em></p>
<p>Chronic stress doesn’t have to come as a result of a major traumatic event. In fact, it’s everyday routine pressures that leave most people, “chronically stressed.”</p>
<p>When your “fight or flight” mode stays “on” for an extended time (or kicks in too often) … that is when you are in a danger zone.</p>
<p>Being in constant “panic mode” presents an opportunity for every system in your body to be affected … either directly or indirectly.</p>

<p><strong>HOW CHRONIC STRESS AFFECTS THE BODY</strong><br />
The longer your body is &#8220;stressed,&#8221; the more significant the impact it will have on your mind and body.</p>
<p>Everyone deals with pressure differently. This varies from person to person based on if the stress is “situational” or “routine” .. and of course your personality type.</p>
<p>Our bodies can handle a little bit of stress. But, we are not designed to manage chronic stress without consequence.</p>
<p>Some ways chronic stress can impact your health include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Weight Gain</li>
<li>Mental Health Problems</li>
<li>GI Issues</li>
<li>Low Libido (and other sexual dysfunctions)</li>
<li>Skin and Hair Problems</li>
<li>Developing bad habits (using alcohol, tobacco, drugs, etc.) as a way to cope.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>HOW TO RECOGNIZE THE EFFECTS OF CHRONIC STRESS</strong><br />
Because we are presented with stressful situations every day, it can sometimes be challenging to determine if you are just a little uptight and in a lousy mood, or if your stress has gotten out of control.</p>
<p>The sooner you realize your stress has moved into a “chronic” state .. the better chance you have to avoid the health hazards it can create.</p>
<p>Because people handle stress differently, everyone&#8217;s symptoms may be different.</p>
<p>Here are a few signs that your stress levels have potentially gone from manageable to chronic:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Extreme fatigue</strong></li>
<li><strong>Inability to concentrate</strong></li>
<li><strong>Racing thoughts</strong></li>
<li><strong>Constant worry</strong></li>
<li><strong>Low motivation</strong></li>
<li><strong>Irritability</strong></li>
<li><strong>A drastic shift in mood (always sad or angry)</strong></li>
<li><strong>Digestive issues</strong></li>
<li><strong>Headaches</strong></li>
<li><strong>Tense muscles</strong></li>
<li><strong>Chest tightness/pain</strong></li>
<li><strong>Blurred vision</strong></li>
<li><strong>Problems falling and staying asleep</strong></li>
<li><strong>Changes in sex drive</strong></li>
<li><strong>A weakened immune system</strong></li>
<li><strong>Unexplained weight gain (or loss)</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>WAYS TO MANAGE STRESS</strong><br />
It may seem like you&#8217;re doomed to live a life full of mounting pressure .. especially if your stressors are something you can’t prevent or control.</p>
<p>Remember, just because you can’t avoid stress, does not mean you can’t be better equipped to deal with it. <em><strong>You have more control than you realize!</strong></em></p>
<p>Of course, stress management is not one-size-fits-all. It may take some experimenting to figure out what calms you the most.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>8 Proven Stress Management Techniques</strong></p>
<p><img class="size-large wp-image-7021" src="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_283771005.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_283771005.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_283771005.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_283771005.jpeg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_283771005.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_283771005.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><strong>1. Recognize, Admit, Accept &amp; Take Ownership</strong><br />
Stop saying, <em>“I’m fine”</em> and admit that you could probably chill out a little.</p>
<p>If you don’t acknowledge you are overwhelmed, you can’t take appropriate action steps to get things under control.</p>
<p>Every time you notice any of the “stress symptoms” mentioned above, admit you are stressed and take note of what is causing you to become frazzled.</p>
<p>Some stressors are easy to identify (job loss, moving, a break-up, chronic illness, etc.)<br />
In these situations, the best thing you can do is accept that it is happening and focus on the things you can control, such as the way you choose to react.</p>
<p>Other causes of stress are more difficult to pinpoint.<br />
It is easy to look past the actions, thoughts, and feelings that are keeping you uptight. Be honest with yourself, and consider that the real cause of your stress could originate from your own bad attitude, unhealthy habits, or excuses.</p>
<p>Once you have a list of your stress triggers and ways that you are contributing… start looking at ways you can eliminate.</p>
<p>If it’s not impossible to rid yourself of the source, you have to learn to manage the stress it causes.</p>
<p><strong>The next 7 steps will help with that.</strong></p>

<p><strong>2. Get regular exercise</strong><br />
There is a reason that many people call workouts .. therapy. Exercise can provide a healthy distraction and research proves that those who workout regularly are much less anxious than those who do not.</p>
<p>Being active reduces stress hormones and releases the brains “feel good” chemicals &#8230; called endorphins. This rush can elevate your mood and decrease tension.</p>
<p>You can up the “happy” by taking some of your workouts outdoors! Natural sunlight can boost mood and help regulate your circadian rhythm to promote a good night’s rest.</p>
<p>Sleep is even more important when you are stressed out, because tension can cause your cortisol (stress hormone) to skyrocket!</p>
<p>One of the best ways to combat that and keep your cortisol in a healthy range&#8230; is with quality sleep!</p>

<p><strong>3. Meditation</strong><br />
Practicing meditation does wonders for not only relaxing your mind… but shifting your focus from negative to positive.</p>
<p>Making time for your spiritual health can allow you to see things from a new, and much calmer perspective (more on perspective in tip #8 below.)</p>
<p>Find a quiet place and spend at least 10 minutes in the present moment. Allow any anxious or negative thoughts to come in, and then use your personal practice of meditation to release them.</p>
<p><em><strong>Words are powerful</strong></em>. Set positivity into motion by speaking positive hope-filled words instead of fear-filled words. Say it, believe for it!</p>

<p><strong>4. Try Journaling</strong><br />
The simple act of writing things down and “getting them off your chest” has been proven to significantly reduce stress.</p>
<p>Writing down the way you feel helps clear your mind, organize your thoughts, and gives meaning to the things weighing you down.</p>
<p>There is no right or wrong way to journal. Start writing all of your thoughts and emotions, but don’t only use your journal as a way to vent.</p>
<p><em><strong>Keeping a journal is most beneficial if you also make time to focus on the positive.</strong></em></p>
<p>Write down things you are grateful for, and at least one positive that is happening, or could happen, as a result of your stressors.</p>
<p>Include ways you can improve your reactions, outcomes you would like to see, and lessons you would like to learn from your hardships.</p>
<p>It is just as important to be positive in your writing as it is to release the negative.</p>
<p>If you find it difficult to concentrate while journaling, check out <a href="https://sculptnation.com/neuroctane" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this article</a> for some helpful tips to enhance mental clarity. Our brain is continually going, going, going. Like any other muscle, it needs to be fueled to function at top capacity.</p>

<p><strong>5. Breathing Techniques</strong><br />
One of the most powerful tools for returning to a calm state of mind after a moment of stress is incorporating breathing exercises.</p>
<p>These techniques work by activating a part of the nervous system that controls your relaxation response.</p>
<p>There are many apps and methods out there.</p>
<p>Here are two of our favorites.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/lung-health-and-disease/learning-diaphragmatic-breathing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Belly Breathing:</strong></a><br />
Start by sitting or lying down. Take a deep breath through your nose until your chest is full and your belly expands.. then slowly exhale. You should begin to feel relaxing effects after just a few breaths.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=8&amp;v=gz4G31LGyog&amp;feature=emb_logo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The 4-7-8 Method:</a></strong><br />
While sitting or lying in a comfortable position, empty all of the air out of your lungs.<br />
Breathe in through your nose for 4 seconds, hold the breath for 7 seconds, and then exhale forcefully through your mouth for 8 seconds. Repeat the cycle up to 4 times.</p>
<p>Both of these methods can regulate your heart rate, lower your stress hormones (cortisol), and almost instantly reverse the stress response.</p>
<p><img class="size-large wp-image-7022" src="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_94995620.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_94995620.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_94995620.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_94995620.jpeg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_94995620.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_94995620.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><strong>6. Set Limits</strong><br />
One major cause of stress is being pulled in a million different directions.</p>
<p>Stress levels are almost always parallel to the number of items on your to-do list. However, it’s not so much the ITEMS on your agenda that causes stress, as much as it is your attachment to them or fears that they won’t have a particular outcome, or get checked off.</p>
<p>Ask yourself how important the outcome is, then determine what’s necessary and what’s not. Learn to SAY NO to the things that are not essential, or can be passed on to someone else.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><em><strong>Much of your stress is connected to the things that are left UNdone.</strong></em><br />
<em><strong>Instead of a TO DO list … maybe you should have an &#8230; I am NOT GONNA DO IT list!</strong></em></p>
<p>There are other boundaries (that do not involve your calendar) that you can set that will lower stress levels.</p>
<ul>
<li>Remove yourself from stressful situations that don’t directly involve you.</li>
<li>Limit negative screen time (the news, etc.)</li>
<li>Avoid being around negative or easily agitated people.</li>

<p><strong>7. Resist Isolation</strong><br />
Loneliness can make it difficult to deal with stress. The “empty” feelings that come about when we isolate ourselves can also make any stress you are under .. even worse.</p>
<p>It is important to connect with people that make you feel calm, happy, and can offer a listening ear.</p>
<p>Researchers found that social interactions release a natural stress reliever called oxytocin. This is a hormone (also known as the cuddle or love hormone) that is released when people bond socially. It counteracts the “fight-or-flight response we told you about at the beginning of this article.</p>
<p>We would normally tell you to limit your screen time and make IN PERSON connections, but in times of social distancing, this may not be possible.</p>
<p>For now, take advantage of technology and have regular phone and video chat dates.</p>
<p>Use social media as well, but be cautious of what accounts you follow. Delete or mute pages that make you feel any sort of pressure and follow accounts that promote positivity.</p>

<p><strong>8. Shift Your Perspective</strong><br />
<em>“People are disturbed not by a thing, but by their perception of a thing.” — Epictetus.</em></p>
<p>What a great quote and principal to apply to our lives.</p>
<p>Our thoughts are not usually fact. We allow our minds to go to places it should never be.<br />
When overwhelmed&#8230; it’s easy to become negative and cynical. Shifting your perspective and being positive can be one of your greatest weapons.</p>
<p>One study at the University of Michigan tested this philosophy with combat soldiers and found that those that were less negative in their thinking and more hopeful functioned better during difficult times.</p>
<p>When faced with something that makes you feel uptight .. ask yourself …</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Is it really worth the panic?</em></li>
<li><em>How important will this be in a week, a month, a year?</em></li>
<li><em>How will stressing out change the situation?</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Now, take those questions a step further and ask yourself how your reaction can make the situation proactive/positive!</p>
<ul>
<li><em>What can I learn from the situation?</em></li>
<li><em>What is the potential silver lining?</em></li>
<li><em>Is there something within the stressor that I can also be grateful for?</em></li>
</ul>
<p><em><strong>Stress can be debilitating if you allow it.</strong></em> Changing the way you look at the situations you face can be the difference in your blood boiling&#8230; or you coming out of the storm a stronger and better person.</p>
