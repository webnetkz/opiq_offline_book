<p><strong>RECIPE 1: CAULIFLOWER BUNS</strong><br />
*Servings will vary pending the size you want to make your buns*</p>
<p>Using cauliflower instead of bread may sound unappealing, but with the right recipe, you won’t notice the cauliflower taste. You will only be left with hundreds of calories that you can use somewhere else (like on our healthy protein apple pie or sugar free jello shots.)</p>
<p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>1 (12 oz) bag cauliflower rice</li>
<li>1 egg white</li>
<li>1 tbsp coconut flour</li>
<li>1/4 tsp salt</li>
<li>1-1/2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
<li>1 tsp each of any other seasonings you want your bun to taste like!</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Directions:</strong><br />
Steam the cauliflower according to the package; drain until ALL WATER IS REMOVED (this is key) and let cool. You may want to use a cheesecloth or dry paper towels to make sure ALL water is removed.</p>
<p>Whisk together the coconut flour, baking powder, seasonings, add the cauliflower mixture, and egg white. Stirring until blended. If the batter is too dry, try adding teaspoons of unsweetened nut milk, or even water, to reach desired consistency.</p>
<p>There are several methods you can use to make your buns! Here are a few!</p>
<p><em><strong>Muffin Tins</strong></em><br />
Distribute evenly into muffin tins. Bake in the preheated oven for 40 to 45 minutes until golden brown at edges and centers feel set when lightly touched. Transfer to a cooling rack and let cool completely before removing. Slice them in half and serve up!</p>
<p><em><strong>QUICK TIP</strong></em> … You can also use this batter and pour it directly into a small sprayed skillet .. in a mini-waffle or pancake maker .. or even in the microwave!!</p>
<p><em><strong>For the microwave version&#8230;</strong> </em><br />
Pour a couple of inches of batter into a deep coffee mug. The larger it is, the better, unless you are eating a tiny patty of meat. Microwave time will vary, but zap it about 45 seconds and see if it’s ready. If not, keep adding 10 seconds at a time until done!</p>
<p>Don’t overcook, or it will be too dry. Dump out of the mug .. let cool .. cut in half …. Enjoy!</p>
<p><em><strong>TIP</strong></em> .. if they still don’t seem “toasted” enough. You can always throw them on the grill, put them in a toaster oven, or even an air-fryer!</p>

<p><strong>RECIPE 2: FIRECRACKER GRILLED SALMON</strong><br />
You may not think of salmon as being a 4th of July staple, but eating this super healthy fish on Independence Day .. is a tradition in New England!</p>
<p>According to history buffs, it started by coincidence. During the mid-summer months, salmon was plentiful in that region. Because it was “in season” &#8211; it always ended up on the dinner table for Independence Day! Even though salmon is available year-round now, the holiday tradition of eating salmon on the 4th remains to be a big deal there!</p>
<p>If you want to celebrate like the New Englanders .. this grilled salmon recipe is tasty, tangy, and packs just enough heat. The only calories it packs on, are from heart-healthy Omega 3’s!</p>
<p>The calorie content in salmon can be well over 300 calories, or as low as well under 200 calories.<br />
You want to always buy salmon labeled wild” and not farmed.</p>
<p>Wild salmon has fewer calories and half the fat content of the same amount of farmed salmon, and it is better for you.</p>
<p>While farmed salmon is sometimes praised for having slightly more omega-3 fatty acids, it is also very high in saturated fat &#8211; which is a type of fat you do not want.</p>
<p>Farmed salmon is also known for having more unsafe contaminants, chemicals from polluted waters, and other pollutants. Farmed salmon comes with the potential of antibiotic use.<br />
Wild salmon does not.</p>
<p>Some good choices would be WILD sockeye (red), king, keta, coho, or atlantic.</p>
<p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>4 (4-6 ounce) wild salmon fillets</li>
<li>⅛ -¼ cup peanut oil</li>
<li>2 tablespoons soy sauce (or coconut aminos)</li>
<li>2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar</li>
<li>2 tablespoons green onions, chopped</li>
<li>1 teaspoon brown sugar</li>
<li>1 cloves garlic, minced</li>
<li>½-1 teaspoon ground ginger</li>
<li>1 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes</li>
<li>½ teaspoon sesame oil</li>
<li>Pinch of salt</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Directions:</strong><br />
Place salmon fillets in a glass dish.</p>
<p>In a separate bowl, combine the peanut oil, soy sauce, vinegar, green onions, brown sugar, garlic, ginger, red pepper flakes, sesame oil, and salt. Whisk well and pour over the fish.</p>
<p>Cover and let marinate in the refrigerator for at least 4 to 6 hours.</p>
<p>Transfer filets to aluminum foil and place them on the grill.</p>
<p>Grill 10 minutes per inch of thickness. Turn over halfway through cooking.</p>
<p>*With any meat, it is best to use a food thermometer to ensure you do not under-cook or overcook for your liking. For salmon, it is re</p>
<p>commended the internal temp reach 145. Keep in mind that meat will continue to cook just a tad after it leaves the grill*</p>
<p>If you want to really keep with New England tradition, pair your salmon with some peas! They ate salmon with this nutritious veggie .. because it too .. was in season at the time!</p>
<p>Not sure how to enjoy this green veggie … check out our next recipe idea!</p>

<p><strong>RECIPE 3: GRILLED VEGGIES</strong><br />
Pair your salmon with some grilled sugar snap peas! Peas are one of several vegetables that are great cooked up on the grill!</p>
<p>Grilling your veggies is one of the healthiest side-dishes you can enjoy at your cookout. Put them on a kabob, throw them in some aluminum foil, or put them straight on the grill… no oil needed!</p>
<p>Many veggies do well on the grill, but a few really shine!</p>
<p>Asparagus, eggplant, mushrooms, onions, zucchini, eggplant, and bell peppers are excellent options!</p>
<p>Of course, you can’t go wrong with some corn on the cob. Just keep in in mind that corn is a vegetable that is higher in carbs!</p>

<p><strong>RECIPE 4: SUMMER SALAD </strong><br />
<strong>(Serving size &#8211; 1 large salad</strong>)</p>
<p>There is just something satisfying about a nice summer salad! This one follows a “red, white, and blue” theme .. with fresh blueberries, strawberries, and a virtually <em><strong>calorie free</strong></em> <em><strong>homemade vinaigrette dressing!</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>2 cups mixed salad greens of choice</li>
<li>1/4 c fresh blueberries</li>
<li>1/4 c fresh sliced strawberries</li>
<li>4 oz grilled lean protein from the grill</li>
<li>1/2 c cooked quinoa, rice, or cauliflower rice.</li>
<li>2 tbsp. Crumbled fat-free feta cheese</li>
<li>2 tbsp. Fat Free Vinaigrette (DIY recipe below)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Instructions:</strong><br />
Toss all ingredients except dressing together… mix up .. enjoy!</p>
<p><strong>**Healthy Homemade Vinaigrette Dressing**</strong><br />
This comes with a warning. You may never want to buy salad dressing again! It will be hard to believe that something this good .. is virtually calorie-free (minus the few calories in the mustard and stevia.)</p>
<p>The base of this recipe can be altered to go with any salad! Think greek seasonings and lemon juice for a greek salad! Get creative!</p>
<p>The amounts below should be enough to cover 1-2 salads.</p>
<p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>6 tablespoons vinegar: balsamic, white wine, champagne, apple cider, rice, or red wine vinegar.</li>
<li>4 teaspoons mustard: Dijon is the best, but you can also use yellow, brown, or spicy.</li>
<li>2 teaspoons Stevia (or a few squirts/drops of liquid stevia if that is what you typically use)</li>
<li>1 clove garlic, crush or minced (or some garlic salt)</li>
<li>2-4 tablespoons water</li>
<li>Salt &amp; pepper to taste</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Instructions:</strong><br />
Simply whisk together and pour over salad!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>RECIPE 5: HEALTHY POTATO SALAD</strong><br />
<strong>(Approx 8 Servings)</strong><br />
Traditional potato salad is drowning in high fat mayonnaise! This recipe lightens things up by using non-fat greek yogurt! We promise that making this smart swap will not compromise any of the flavor in this popular BBQ side dish. Go with one type of potato, or use a colorful medley, if you want to go with a “red-white-blue” theme!</p>
<p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>2 pounds russet, yukon gold, or red potatoes.</li>
<li>1 tablespoon salt (for cooking potatoes)</li>
<li>½ cup plain, non-fat, greek yogurt</li>

<p><strong>RECIPE 6: Low(er) Calorie Baked Beans</strong><br />
<strong>(Approx 10-12 servings)</strong></p>
<p>Baked beans are a cookout staple, but they are often soaked in ketchup and/or BBQ (remember what we said about condiments containing all kinds of hidden calories.) They also usually have fatty bacon and lots of brown sugar and/or molasses.</p>
<p>This recipe dials down the calories by subbing turkey bacon .. reduces sodium and sugar by using tomato sauce .. and further lightens the sugar-load by using stevia brown sugar!</p>
<p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>2 slices turkey bacon (chopped)</li>
<li>1 diced onion</li>
<li>15 ounce can navy beans , rinsed and drained</li>
<li>15 ounce can pinto beans , rinsed and drained</li>
<li>15 ounce can northern beans , rinsed and drained</li>
<li>1/2 cup tomato sauce</li>
<li>1 1/2 cups water</li>
<li>1 tsp Worcestershire sauce</li>
<li>1/4 tsp smoked​ paprika</li>
<li>1/2 cup stevia brown sugar</li>
<li>1 tablespoon yellow mustard</li>
<li>1 teaspoon chili powder</li>
<li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
<li>1/4 teaspoon black pepper</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Instructions:</strong><br />
In a large cooking pot &#8211; add bacon (with a little oil or spray oil) and cook on medium heat.<br />
Remove bacon once cooked.</p>
<p>Add onions to the pot and cook until translucent.</p>
<p>Add in beans, tomato sauce, water, dark brown sugar, yellow mustard, chili powder, salt and pepper, and stir.</p>
<p>Bring to a boil then reduce to a simmer. Cook for 45-60 minutes (until thick)</p>

<p><strong>NON-ALCOHOLIC PATRIOTIC PUNCH</strong><br />
(Perfect following your patriotic pump workout.)</p>
<p>Ingredients:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://sculptnation.com/products/bcaas" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sculpt Nation Fruit Punch BCAAs</a> (prepared with water)</li>
<li>Blue Sports Drink (Zero calorie version)</li>
<li>Diet Sprite or 7-Up</li>
<li>Crushed ice</li>
<li>Regular ice cubes</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Instructions:</strong><br />
Fill up your cup all the way with ice cubes.<br />
Pour in your pre-made <a href="https://sculptnation.com/products/bcaas" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sculpt Nation BCAAs</a> (about ⅓ of the way)<br />
Add a few more ice cubes.<br />
Slowly pour a layer of blue Gatorade (about another ⅓ of the way up) directly over the ice cubes.<br />
Add crushed ice and slowly pour on the diet soda.</p>
<p>Using crushed ice should help keep the “colors” from mixing as much. It also gives the “white” to your red-white-blue drink theme!</p>

<p>Family … Friends … Fireworks .. and a lot of FOOD!</p>
<p>That is how the majority of Americans plan to spend The 4th of July … and most of that food will be thrown on the grill .. as July Fourth is the most popular grilling day of the year.</p>
<p>If the idea of an Independence Day cookout has you feeling a little bit anxious about all the extra calories .. relax!!</p>
<p>It may seem like a diet disaster, but with a few adjustments, your cookout won’t set you back one bit!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Here are 5 Tips To Help You Grill Out GUILT FREE …</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>HEALTHY BBQ TIP #1: FIRE UP THE GRILL</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://sculptnation.com/products"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-7313" src="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_83769871.jpeg?resize=1170%2C834&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1170" height="834" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_83769871.jpeg?w=3052&amp;ssl=1 3052w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_83769871.jpeg?resize=300%2C214&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_83769871.jpeg?resize=768%2C547&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_83769871.jpeg?resize=1024%2C730&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_83769871.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w" sizes="(max-width: 1170px) 100vw, 1170px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>If your BBQ includes grilling .. you are in luck. This is one of the best ways to cook meat or make some veggies. You use much less (if any) oil on a grill, as opposed to sautéing or roasting. Grilling alone will really help lower your 4th of July calorie intake.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>HEALTHY BBQ TIP #2: PICK LEAN PROTEINS</strong></p>
<p><img class="size-large wp-image-7335" src="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_187212985.jpeg?resize=1024%2C661&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="661" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_187212985.jpeg?resize=1024%2C661&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_187212985.jpeg?resize=300%2C194&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_187212985.jpeg?resize=768%2C496&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_187212985.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_187212985.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>Hitting your protein goals on the 4th shouldn’t be a problem. You just need to be careful what cut of meat you choose.</p>
<p>A small burger patty or steak could easily set you back 25 grams of fat or more. Most hot dogs have a minimum of 14 grams of fat. Of course, that is before all the condiments and cheese.</p>
<p>You can still have a juicy, delicious burger, or hot dog, you just need to pick a leaner cut.</p>
<p>Examples of lean cuts of beef are … 96/4 or 90/10 ground sirloin, eye of round steak, sirloin tip steak, top round steak, bottom round steak, and top sirloin steak</p>
<p>For hot dogs .. there are a lot of low-fat or even fat-free franks on the market. You can also opt for a turkey or chicken hot dog. Just make sure you look at the nutrition label. People often think that turkey and chicken are automatically the most calorie-friendly choice. Sometimes they can be just as calorie filled as the original.</p>
<p>You can always skip the beef and go with other lean meats like chicken breast, white fish, shrimp, or even salmon.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>HEALTHY BBQ TIP #3: DITCH THE BUN &amp; CHOOSE CONDIMENTS WISELY</strong></p>
<p><img class="size-large wp-image-7330" src="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_266973608.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_266973608.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_266973608.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_266973608.jpeg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_266973608.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_266973608.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">What&#8217;s a burger or hot dog without a bun? Actually .. they can be just as delicious without all those extra carbs. A bun usually contains about 200 calories.</p>
<p>Why not save those calories for some delicious sides like potato salad? Or an adult beverage, like a watermelon tonic?</p>
<p>After all, the bun is really just a way for us to eat what’s inside. Your burger will be just as good eaten with a fork!</p>
<p>Save yourself some calories, and opt for a lettuce wrap or no bun at all. Or, check out this delicious bun recipe that is EASY to make and will only set you back a few carbs. You won&#8217;t miss the real bread, promise!!</p>
<p>To make your burger more filling, load it up with plenty of vegetables &#8211; like tomatoes, onions, mushrooms, lettuce, jalapenos, etc. But use caution with condiments.</p>
<p>BBQ sauce and mayonnaise can be calorie bombs. A couple tiny spoonfuls could set you back hundreds of calories. Believe it or not, even ketchup is pretty calorie-dense.</p>
<p>Mustard, salsa, horseradish, and hot sauce are great choices. There are some great low-sugar or lower calorie bbq and ketchup alternatives out there. Look for those when you do your 4th of July grocery haul!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>HEALTHY BBQ TIP #4: PORTION CONTROL</strong></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-7331" src="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_90994388.jpeg?resize=1024%2C669&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="669" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_90994388.jpeg?resize=1024%2C669&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_90994388.jpeg?resize=300%2C196&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_90994388.jpeg?resize=768%2C502&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_90994388.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_90994388.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>The best way to avoid a bbq binge is to not go to your cookout hungry. Starving yourself all day could backfire .. causing you to overeat on higher calorie foods.</p>
<p>You don’t need to starve yourself all day and stock-pile calories. Especially if you are using any of our healthy recipes below.</p>
<p>You also don’t need to eat everything available. Prioritize lean protein and veggies and then scan the picnic table for what appeals to you <em><strong>the most</strong></em> and only have small portions of each of those things.</p>
<p>Eat plenty of protein leading up to the BBQ and drink lots of water. Protein shakes are a convenient and delicious way to do that .. and for a limited time we are giving you <strong>40% off your <a href="https://sculptnation.com/products" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sculpt Nation</a> order!</strong></p>

<p>You can also avoid overeating by eating slow and socializing! Food may be a big part of 4th of July festivities .. but it’s not the only reason we gather to celebrate.</p>
<p>If you find yourself still wanting more, step away from the food spread for a little while. Drink some water, or enjoy one of our low-calorie drinks below. Give yourself a little bit of time before you go back for seconds.</p>
<p>Another way you can keep your cravings in check and make sure your body is in a better fat burning mode (instead of fat storing mode) .. is to take a fat-burning thermogenic support supplement like <a href="https://sculptnation.com/products/burn" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>Sculpt Nation BURN.</strong></em></a></p>
<p>This product has a ton of science-backed ingredients that can help naturally suppress your appetite!</p>
<p>It is different from a lot of other fat burners on the market. It doesn’t only help you feel more satiated, it has ingredients that attack your body fat from three essential pathways..</p>
<p>It helps support and raise your metabolic rate, which helps boost your body’s ability to burn fat for fuel!</p>
<p>Grab some <a href="https://sculptnation.com/products/burn" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>BURN</strong></a> today for 40% off! With code <strong>JULY40</strong> at checkout.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>HEALTHY BBQ TIP #5: PUMP UP YOUR PATRIOTISM</strong></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-7322" src="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_8006.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_8006.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_8006.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_8006.jpeg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_8006.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>Eating healthy on Cinco de Mayo Is Easier Than You Think</strong></em></p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-7080 aligncenter" src="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/CDM-blog-01-fb-vs.gif?resize=600%2C600&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="600" height="600" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>It is time for the ultimate #TacoTuesday … Cinco de Mayo 2020 is upon us!</p>
<p>If you are on a diet (or just trying not to gain the “Quarantine 15”) … you may think that a fiesta of tacos, tortillas, and tequila is off-limits.</p>
<p>No doubt, many standard Mexican dishes are full of calories, which could easily result in a dieting disaster!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>But you don&#8217;t have to skip the Cinco de Mayo festivities.</strong></em></p>
<p>Without all of the oils, sauces, and cheese, most of the ingredients that make up your favorite Mexican dishes are very waistline-friendly.</p>
<ul>
<li>Lean Meat</li>
<li>Fiber-Rich Beans</li>
<li>Rice</li>
<li>Vegetables</li>
<li>Salsa</li>
<li>Avocado</li>
<li>Herbs and Spices (like cilantro, chile peppers, etc.)</li>
</ul>
<p>The base for most Mexican cuisine is very diet-friendly! Which makes modifying your Cinco de Mayo spread super easy!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>Grab your sombrero…</strong></em><br />
<em><strong>We’ve got a Cinco de Mayo menu that will allow you to</strong></em><br />
<em><strong>enjoy the festivities and stay on track!</strong></em></p>
<p>Before we give you TEN different macro-friendly recipes, here is a Cinco de Mayo FUN FACT for ya … in case you want to impress your fiesta crew!</p>
<p><em><strong>Did you know</strong></em>… Cinco de Mayo (Spanish for “5th of May”) is not a Mexican holiday?<br />
Many people confuse it with Mexican Independence Day (that isn’t until September.)</p>
<p>Cinco de Mayo is actually a day that commemorates the Battle of Puebla when the Mexican army had victory over France during the Franco-Mexican War.</p>
<p>Except for the city of Puebla, where they celebrate with a military parade and mock battle, Cinco celebrations are pretty low-key in Mexico.</p>
<p>Americans, however, use the day as an excuse to eat tacos, bottomless bowls of chips and salsa and pound pitchers of margaritas!</p>
<p>I mean, we aren’t complaining… any excuse for some tacos and tequila, right?</p>
<p>Enough history&#8230; let the fiesta begin!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>HEALTHY CINCO MAIN DISHES</strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>LOW CARB FISH TACO BOWL</strong></span><br />
This bowl reminds us of a sunny day at the beach! It is so flavorful that you won’t even miss the carb-filled tortilla! We are using white fish, but you can substitute grilled chicken, salmon, or shrimp!</p>

<p>There really isn’t a special recipe here (however we are gonna give you one for some inspo.)</p>
<p>All you do is think of what you love in and on a burrito .. and throw it in a bowl instead of wrapping it in a carb-heavy flour tortilla!</p>
<p>With all the flavors and volume, you won’t miss the carbs! Plus, skipping out on rice or a tortilla means you save calories for an extra Skinny Margarita instead (recipe for that is below.)</p>
<p>Get creative and use your favorite lean protein, veggies, and garnishes!<br />
Here is how we like to make our bowl ….</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Bowl Ingredients:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Lean meat of choice (grilled chicken, lean shredded pork, lean steak, fish, shrimp, etc.)</li>
<li>Lots of shredded lettuce</li>
<li>Steamed cilantro lime rice, cauliflower rice, or quinoa.</li>
<li>Sauteed Fajita Veggies</li>
<li>Fajita Seasoning</li>
<li>Black Beans</li>
<li>Corn</li>
<li>Salsa</li>
<li>Pico</li>
<li>Guac</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Bowl Instructions:</span></p>
<p>Make your meat however you choose using seasonings that compliment Mexican fare!<br />
We are using a lean sirloin steak rubbed with a cilantro lime seasoning.</p>
<p>Make your steamed rice, cauli rice, or quinoa (add lime, cilantro, and salt for extra flavor.)</p>
<p>Sautee Veggies (we are using olive oil cooking spray, peppers, onions, and mushrooms)</p>
<p>Crack open a can of corn and black beans and heat them up on the stove or microwave.</p>
<p>Put a ton of shredded lettuce in a big bowl. Mix in some salsa, lime juice, and seasoning to give your lettuce a little extra flavor. Pile in all your ingredients. Mix up. Top with garnishes of choice…. dig in!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>SOUTHWEST CHICKEN QUESADILLAS</strong></span><br />
Typically we would tell you that a quesadilla should be a hard pass. At a restaurant, this carb-heavy menu staple is fried in oil and filled with hundreds of calories of cheese, with very little (and sometimes no) protein and veggies. But it is easy to give this typically high-calorie Mexican staple a healthy upgrade at home!</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Ingredients:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>10 oz Raw Chicken Breast</li>
<li>4 small multi-grain tortillas, corn tortillas, or low carb wraps</li>
<li>¼ cup hummus of choice (we like red pepper, jalapeno, etc.)</li>
<li>½ cup chopped red onion</li>
<li>½ cup black beans</li>
<li>2 tbsp minced garlic</li>
<li>4 tbsp goat cheese</li>
<li>1 small sliced avocado</li>
<li>Fresh cilantro</li>
<li>Salsa or Pico</li>
<li>Coconut oil spray</li>
</ul>
<p>*optional for added protein and dipping*<br />
FF Greek Yogurt (great substitute for sour cream)</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Instructions:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>Spray a non-stick skillet with spray and heat on medium-high</li>
<li>Saute 1 tbsp minced garlic and onions. Add chicken (thinly sliced) and cook about 12-15 minutes or until fully cooked.</li>
<li>Spread hummus onto each of your tortillas.</li>
<li>On one side of your tortillas &#8211; evenly distribute your cooked chicken mixture, black beans, goat cheese, sliced avocado, and some fresh chopped cilantro.</li>
<li>Fold tortillas in half.</li>
<li>Spray skillet with oil and allow skillet to heat to medium heat.</li>
<li>Add quesadillas and cook (one at a time or however much space you have in the pan) for about 2 minutes per side.</li>
<li>Press down w/spatula, so they flatten out.</li>
</ol>
<p>Top with salsa and dip in greek yogurt!</p>
<p><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">** TIP **</span></em><br />
If you don’t like plain greek yogurt, try mixing in some lime juice, taco seasonings, smashed avocado, or even some low sugar ketchup (yes ketchup, don’t knock it till you try it.)</p>

<p>One of the quickest ways to eat a TON of calories in no time&#8230; is with chips and dips!</p>
<p>For “chips” … there are lots of baked versions you can purchase. But if you want to make your own tortilla chips, it is super simple!</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Tortilla Chip Ingredients:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Corn tortillas</li>
<li>Olive or Avocado Oil Spray (or a tiny bit of the actual oil)</li>
<li>Salt</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Tortilla Chip Instructions:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Heat oven to 350 degrees.</li>
<li>Cut corn tortillas into triangles.</li>
<li>Spray or lightly brush with oil.</li>
<li>Sprinkle on some salt.</li>
<li>Place on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper and bake about 10 minutes, or until crispy!</li>
</ul>
<p><em><strong>If you want to save some carbs, a great alternative to chips would be fresh veggies, like peppers, celery, and zucchini!</strong></em></p>
<p>For “dips”… salsa is always a safe choice, especially if you make your own at home.</p>
<p>Guacamole is another popular choice. While guac is made with healthy avocados, it is easy to overeat this delicious chip dipper!</p>
<p>But with a simple recipe trick, you can easily add “bulk” to your guacamole so you can<br />
enjoy more&#8230; for less!</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Skinny Guacamole Ingredients:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>1 large ripe avocado</li>
<li>1/4 cup coarsely chopped fresh cilantro</li>
<li>1/4 cup finely chopped onion</li>
<li>2 cloves garlic</li>
<li>2 tablespoons lime juice</li>
<li>1/2 teaspoon hot sauce</li>
<li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
<li>1 large zucchini cut into chunks OR 1 cup steamed peas</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Skinny Guacamole Instructions:</span></p>
<p>(zucchini version)</p>
<ul>
<li>Place the chopped zucchini in a microwave-safe bowl and cover with a damp paper towel. Microwave on high until tender (3-5 minutes.)</li>
<li>Drain any liquid by pressing lightly on the zucchini.</li>
<li>Let cool for about 5 minutes.</li>
<li>Add avocado, cilantro, onion, garlic, lime juice, hot sauce, and salt. Mash with a fork until combined.</li>
</ul>
<p>(pea version) *using peas will make the guac slightly sweeter*</p>
<ul>
<li>Lightly steam peas. Allow to cool and then mash by hand or place in a food processor and pulse until the peas are smooth.</li>
<li>Transfer peas into a large bowl and add the rest of the guacamole ingredients above, minus the zucchini (Adding both could work too. More veggies is never a bad thing.)</li>
<li>Mix well, mashing the avocado as you stir.</li>
</ul>

<p>Also known as Elote, this delicious corn dish was given the nickname “Mexican Street Corn” because it is a staple for street vendors in Mexico.</p>
<p>You can get fancy and make/serve it on a stick like they do .. or skip the stick .. and place it straight on the grill. If you don’t have a grill, you can also make the corn in the oven.<br />
Can’t find corn on the cob? Use canned or frozen corn, mix in the other ingredients, and serve it off the cob!</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Ingredients:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>4 medium corn on the cob (husked and silk removed)</li>
<li>¼ cup light or fat free mayonnaise</li>
<li>¼ cup fresh chopped cilantro</li>
<li>2 tbsp plain fat free greek yogurt</li>
<li>1 tsp fresh lime juice</li>
<li>1 tsp</li>
<li>½ tsp ancho chile powder</li>
<li>¼ tsp minced garlic</li>
<li>4 Tbsp cotija cheese (Can sub crumbled fat free feta for an even healthier version, see notes)</li>
<li>Olive oil cooking spray</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Instructions</span></p>
<ol>
<li>Preheat grill to medium.</li>
<li>Lightly spray corn with cooking spray.</li>
<li>Place corn on the grill, turning occasionally.</li>
<li>Cook until tender and slightly charred (10-15 minutes.)</li>
<li>While the corn is on the grill, combine all ingredients except the cheese in a small bowl.</li>
<li>When corn is ready, brush with the mixture and then sprinkle each ear with 1 Tbsp cheese. Add a few more shakes of chili powder for an extra kick!</li>
</ol>
<p>*While they both have a similar texture and mild salty flavor, feta cheese will not taste the same as cotija. Because feta is easy to find and comes in a fat free variety, it is a decent substitute that could serve as a lower-calorie option. Grated parmesan cheese could also be a substitute.</p>

<p>Mexican sangria is a traditional Spanish beverage that combines wine, fruit, sugar, and some spices. It is known to have a slightly higher alcohol content than Spanish sangria and pairs well with spicy foods!</p>
<p>We are gonna go a MUCH healthier route with a sangria “mocktail” that contains <a href="https://sculptnation.com/products/bcaas" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BCAAs</a>, making it a perfect post-workout treat! Because we know you are gonna get in a sweat session before your fiesta, right?</p>
<p>Ingredients:<br />
1 scoop <a href="https://sculptnation.com/products/bcaas" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sculpt Nation Fruit Punch BCAAs</a><br />
1 cup fruit of choice (examples: sliced blood oranges, sliced peaches, raspberries, strawberries, blueberries, etc. We love the combo of oranges, peaches, and strawberries.)<br />
4 oz diet ginger ale<br />
8 oz water</p>
<p>Instructions:<br />
Add water, a scoop of <a href="https://sculptnation.com/products/bcaas" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sculpt Nation BCAAs</a>, fruit, and ginger ale (in this order) to a shaker cup. Shake up and serve chilled!</p>
<p><em><strong>Why BCAAs?</strong></em><br />
For starters, they are delicious and add flavor to your drink for no added calories (you can’t say the same with typical fruit juices or sangria mixes.)</p>
<p>But they can also provide tons of recovery benefits! So if you take us up on our Cinco Tips (below) and get in a good training session before your fiesta… <em><strong>this Sangria recipe would be a great post-workout drink!</strong></em></p>
<p><a href="https://sculptnation.com/products/bcaas" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BCAAs</a> (or branched-chain amino acids) assist in helping you recover from your training sessions much faster. They provide exactly what your body needs to support getting into an anabolic state (muscle building and fat burning) &#8211; and help repair the damage training causes to your muscle fibers. <em><strong>Quicker recovery means&#8230; less muscle soreness!</strong></em></p>
<p>Faster recovery is only one perk of supplementing with <a href="https://sculptnation.com/products/bcaas" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">quality BCAAs</a>. The essential amino acids in our <a href="https://sculptnation.com/products/bcaas" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sculpt Nation blend</a> have been shown to assist with and support&#8230;</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>If none of these recipes entice your taste buds… there are plenty of healthy swaps you can make that will allow you to stick to your diet…</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>Here are some tips!</strong></em></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>ENJOY</strong></span><br />
<strong>Fresh Veggies</strong>: No limit here! Veggies are a great way to add “bulk” to your Cinco dishes. Just don’t cook them in a ton of oil. Steam or saute with cooking spray!</p>
<p><strong>Lean Meats</strong>: grilled chicken, white fish, shrimp, and even lean shredded pork loin! Load up on lean protein.</p>
<p><strong>Salsa</strong>: This condiment adds tons of flavor to your food and is very low in calories and carbs.<br />
If you are watching sodium, many store-bought salsas are super high in sodium! You can always make you own!</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">LIMIT</span></strong><br />
<strong>Tortillas</strong>: Opt for “thin” or mini street size tortillas. Another option is to mix things up. Have 1-2 tortillas, and for the rest of your tacos, use a lettuce wrap instead!</p>
<p><strong>Rice</strong>: Nothing wrong with rice! Just be mindful. This small grain can add up to some significant carbs! Also, pass on rice cooked in oil and use steamed rice flavored with things like lime juice and cilantro! If you want to add bulk to your rice, do a 50/50 mix of rice and cauli rice!</p>
<p><strong>Guacamole</strong>: Avocados are very healthy! But it can be easy to eat a full day’s worth of fat in one sitting of chips &amp; guac if you aren&#8217;t careful! Remember that even “healthy” foods have calories! If you want more “bulk,” try our lower fat guac recipe above.</p>
<p><strong>Fruit Based Salsa</strong>: This is another example of how healthy foods still have calories. There is nothing wrong with fruit, but keep in mind fruit based salsas do have more carbs.</p>
<p><strong>Low-Fat Cheese</strong>: The same rule applies here! Just be mindful! A sprinkle can go a long way in adding flavor to your dishes!</p>
<p><strong>Beans</strong>: This is another super healthy food that we encourage you to add to your dishes! Just keep in mind that beans do have a decent amount of both protein and fat and not ALL beans are healthy (skip the refried.)</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>PASS</strong></span><br />
<strong>Full Fat Cheese</strong>: Things like queso dip, etc.</p>
<p><strong>Anything Fried</strong>: Eat black beans instead of refried beans. Baked chips instead of fried chips. Soft flour or corn tortillas instead of crispy taco shells.</p>
<p><strong>Fattier Cuts Of Meat</strong>: Many Mexican restaurants use fatty cuts of beef, chicken thighs instead of breast, and pork shoulder instead of a leaner loin. Make sure you are using lean cuts of meat for your dishes.</p>
<p><strong>Sugary Pre-Mixed Drinks</strong>: Of course, alcohol has calories, but so do the sugary mixes you use to make your favorite margarita! Skip the pre-made mixes, or things like triple sec, and make your own using our recipe above. You should use caution with alcohol in general. It’s not just the “empty” calories in the drinks themselves, it’s also the temptation to make bad decisions after a few drinks kick in!</p>
<p><strong>OTHER TIPS</strong><br />
If you are going to support your local Mexican restaurant, when you order, you can make a few special requests to make your meal healthier!</p>
<p>Ask them to steam your vegetables, use light or no oil when cooking, pass on the cheese and refried beans, get ALL sauces on the side and use them in moderation, ask for lettuce wraps instead of tortillas, skip their rice (unless it’s steamed) and add your own at home, and instead of having them include their fried tortilla chips .. make your own using our recipe above.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Healthy or Modified…</em></strong><br />
<em>Make sure you put those calories to good use and get in a pre-Cinco lift!!</em><br />
<em>If you need some ideas, we have hundreds (for free) on our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/vshred" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">YouTube channel</a>!</em></p>
<p>If you decide to indulge and eat some non-modified fiesta foods, here are a few more ways you can lessen the “damage” from all the extra calories you consume!</p>
<ul>
<li>Plan your fiesta to be a “High Carb Day” &#8211; “Free Meal” &#8211; “ReFeed Day” &#8211; etc.</li>
<li>Plan your training split so that you work one of your lagging/larger body parts and get in a solid lift and cardio session before you indulge!</li>
<li>Go on a pre and post-meal walk to increase your daily <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12468415" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NEAT</a>.</li>
<li>Include a fat-burning thermogenic support supplement like <a href="https://sculptnation.com/products/burn">Sculpt Nation BURN</a> that helps naturally suppress appetite!</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://sculptnation.com/products/burn" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BURN</a> is different from many “fat burners” on the market. It’s so unique, we don’t even like to call it that. Most fat burners may help you burn a few extra calories, but it ends there. Any fat that is mobilized may still be in your blood waiting for a new place to live (like your stomach or thighs.)</p>
<p><a href="https://sculptnation.com/products/burn" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BURN</a> goes further .. it attacks your body fat from three essential pathways.. blasting fat cells from the inside out.</p>
