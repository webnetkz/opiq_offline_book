								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>The Testosterone Suppression Response: What it is and how it’s holding you back</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>Close your eyes and imagine&#8230;</strong></em><br />
Having enough energy to power through your day with ease … laser focus and clarity to crush everyday tasks &#8230; seeing optimal results from weight training … ridding yourself of stubborn fat … having a robust sex life … being able to lay your head on your pillow and getting a quality, restful night of sleep.</p>
<p><em><strong>Sounds pretty dang good, doesn’t it?</strong> </em><br />
There are hundreds of chemical substances in your body that work in silence to ensure that all of this (plus more) can happen.</p>
<p><em><strong>We are talking about .. your hormones!</strong></em><br />
Hormones are messengers that tell your organs what they need to do and when.</p>
<p>Your hormones regulate everything… from how you think, feel, sleep, build muscle, store fat, breathe, and expend energy… to how hungry you are, your body temperature, sexual reproduction, libido, and much more.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>It doesn’t matter if you are 20 or 70 .. male or female ..</strong></em><br />
<em><strong>hormone levels can become “imbalanced” at any time &#8211; for many reasons.</strong></em></p>

<p>Even young and healthy individuals can experience hormone disruptions. This can come about from poor diet and lifestyle choices, and believe it or not, too much of a GOOD thing can also cause your hormones to go crazy! Excess exercise and diet can even be culprits!</p>
<p>Because your hormones quietly go to work&#8230;<em><strong> it’s not until something seems off that you would notice they aren’t functioning at top capacity.</strong></em></p>
<p>In this article, we want to discuss two hormones in particular and the shocking and potentially hazardous relationship they have with each other.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>NEW HORMONE RESEARCH SHOCKED US</strong><br />
Scientists have discovered a HIDDEN REASON why one of your KEY HORMONES could be low. And why even if you try to replenish it… your attempts could fail!</p>
<p>It’s something we had never heard before and are pretty sure you haven’t either.</p>
<p>Before we tell you about this strange connection and what you can do to help tackle root cause … we want to emphasize why <em><strong>this is something you should address immediately!</strong></em></p>
<p><a href="https://sculptnation.com/testboost"><img class="size-full wp-image-7240" src="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_194041962.jpeg?resize=1170%2C565&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1170" height="565" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_194041962.jpeg?w=3500&amp;ssl=1 3500w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_194041962.jpeg?resize=300%2C145&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_194041962.jpeg?resize=768%2C371&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_194041962.jpeg?resize=1024%2C494&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_194041962.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w" sizes="(max-width: 1170px) 100vw, 1170px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>THE IMPORTANCE OF OPTIMAL HORMONE LEVELS</strong><br />
Knowing that your hormones are messengers for pretty much every bodily function, you can understand how having balanced hormones is important if you want to look and feel your best.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, hormone imbalance is a widespread issue, and, more times than not, it goes unnoticed.</p>
<p>Most people don’t realize something is “off” until hormone levels have been changing for a while. By this time, they are already causing a number of unexplained issues.</p>
<ul>
<li>Difficulty losing weight</li>
<li>Excess storage of fat</li>
<li>Changes in appetite</li>
<li>GI Issues</li>
<li>Trouble with restful sleep</li>
<li>Exhaustion</li>
<li>Muscle weakness/loss</li>
<li>Occasional shifts in mood</li>
<li>Low sex drive</li>
</ul>
<p><em><strong>These effects can creep up slowly…</strong></em> making it difficult to even realize your body is changing. They are also often brushed aside as a “natural” result of a stress, aging, or the outcome of yet another failed diet.</p>
<p>We all require different hormone levels. But each of us&#8230; no matter weight, height, gender, sex, or race .. should ensure our hormone levels are in a normal, healthy range.</p>
<p>It takes only a small fluctuation to cause big changes.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>WHAT ARE THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF HORMONES</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Your body has two main operating systems… the nervous system and the endocrine system.</p>
<p>The endocrine system is responsible for secreting hormones into the bloodstream via numerous glands.</p>
<p>There are said to be more than 200 hormones or hormone-like substances in the body.</p>
<p><em><strong>Here is a breakdown of some of your MAIN hormones&#8230;</strong></em></p>
<ul>
<li>Thyroid Hormones (T3/T4)</li>
<li>Growth hormone</li>
<li>Leptin</li>
<li>Ghrelin</li>
<li>Insulin</li>
<li>Adrenaline</li>
<li>Serotonin</li>
<li>Estrogen</li>
<li>Progesterone</li>
<li>Cortisol</li>
<li>Testosterone</li>
</ul>
<p>As stated above, for this article, we are only focusing on two.</p>
<p>We are looking into testosterone and cortisol. The relationship researchers have discovered they have with each other&#8230; <em><strong>totally changes the way we look at “boosting” testosterone.</strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>WHAT IS TESTOSTERONE</strong></em></p>
<p><a href="https://sculptnation.com/testboost" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-7237 size-full" src="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_220530200.jpeg?resize=1170%2C780&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1170" height="780" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_220530200.jpeg?w=4000&amp;ssl=1 4000w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_220530200.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_220530200.jpeg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_220530200.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_220530200.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_220530200.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1170px) 100vw, 1170px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">If you are reading this, you need optimal testosterone levels. Testosterone is one of the main hormones responsible for your overall health.</p>
<p>Yes, it is primarily KNOWN as a male sex hormone that is made in the testes&#8230; but women produce and need testosterone.</p>
<p>Testosterone is typically associated with sex drive. It also plays a vital role in the development of muscle mass, bone density, the way you store body fat, and mood.</p>
<p><em><strong>Everyone needs testosterone and no one is safe from declining testosterone levels!</strong></em></p>
<p>There are tons of TESTOSTERONE MYTHS… here are a few we want to bust!!</p>
<p><em><strong>Testosterone is NOT only for men&#8230;</strong></em><br />
Men may make and need more, but ladies, you need this sex hormone too!</p>
<p><em><strong>Age does NOT dictate how much testosterone you have….</strong></em><br />
Just because you are YOUNG does not mean you aren’t at risk for having lower test levels!<br />
Yes, your testosterone levels naturally can decline starting in your 30’s, but this is not the only cause of lower testosterone levels.</p>
<p><em><strong>It’s NOT just some “supplement” meatheads take…</strong></em><br />
Do SOME people abuse testosterone and take a “man-made” version (thinking it will lead to greater muscle gains) &#8211; yes!</p>
<p>Man-made testosterone (an anabolic steroid) is NOT what we are referring to. Your body makes testosterone naturally, and you need optimal levels for optimal health.</p>
<p><em><strong>It’s NOT as simple as “boosting” testosterone levels…</strong> </em><br />
If low testosterone is an issue, people believe that all they need to do is BOOST the testosterone they aren’t creating. So they shell out money products that promise to boost testosterone production.</p>
<p>Sounds like the logical solution, right?</p>
<p><em><strong>NOT SO FAST</strong></em> …. these products can help you support the creation of more testosterone, but that is only HALF of the solution.</p>
<p>We stumbled upon some pretty shocking research that could explain why just <em><strong>replenishing your testosterone levels isn’t enough.</strong></em></p>
<p>There is actually a hidden factor as to why your testosterone may be low, and why modulating testosterone alone may NOT be enough.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>Do you want to promote more energy, better libido, less body fat, and more lean muscle?</strong></em><br />
<em><strong>Then you need to know about this new discovery!</strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>THE HIDDEN REASON YOUR TESTOSTERONE IS LOW</strong><a href="https://sculptnation.com/testboost" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-7235 size-full" src="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_221827769.jpeg?resize=1170%2C635&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1170" height="635" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_221827769.jpeg?w=6000&amp;ssl=1 6000w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_221827769.jpeg?resize=300%2C163&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_221827769.jpeg?resize=768%2C417&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_221827769.jpeg?resize=1024%2C556&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_221827769.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_221827769.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1170px) 100vw, 1170px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">One real reason your testosterone levels have tanked could be because you are making TOO MUCH of another hormone!</p>
<p>Harvard University conducted a groundbreaking study and had a major discovery.</p>
<p>When CORTISOL levels are too high, testosterone levels drop, and any testosterone support you try to give your body may become LESS effective.</p>
<p>If their theory is correct, then <em><strong>it may not be a lack of testosterone that is the issue</strong></em>. Instead, it could be an increase in cortisol that is STOPPING your body’s ability to make and use testosterone.</p>
<p>This means that it won’t matter how much you boost new testosterone you through supplements… <em><strong>If your cortisol is high, all the fresh testosterone in the world won’t matter, because too much of the stress hormone (cortisol) can inhibit testosterone production!!</strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>WHAT IS CORTISOL</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://sculptnation.com/testboost"><img class="size-full wp-image-7238" src="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_243475643.jpeg?resize=1170%2C780&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1170" height="780" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_243475643.jpeg?w=4500&amp;ssl=1 4500w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_243475643.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_243475643.jpeg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_243475643.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_243475643.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_243475643.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1170px) 100vw, 1170px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Cortisol is your body&#8217;s main stress hormone, but it does way more than manage stress response.</p>
<p>It is a “multi-tasking” hormone, meaning it controls many bodily functions…</p>
<ul>
<li>Fuels your body’s “fight-or-flight” instinct</li>
<li>Boosts energy levels</li>
<li>Regulates mood</li>
<li>Controls sleep/wake cycles</li>
<li>Helps control blood sugar levels</li>
<li>Manages how your body uses carbs/fats/protein</li>
<li>Regulates metabolism</li>
<li>Helps reduce inflammation</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are mentally stressed out, have an “a-type” personality, do not get enough sleep, are calorie restricted for an extended time, or are training too hard &#8211; <em><strong>there is a good chance your cortisol could be out of range.</strong></em></p>
<p>Your body NEEDS healthy levels of cortisol, but too much can lead to a host of issues.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>THE IMPORTANT RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN CORTISOL AND TESTOSTERONE</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://sculptnation.com/testboost"><img class="size-full wp-image-7236" src="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_319140527.jpeg?resize=1170%2C658&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1170" height="658" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_319140527.jpeg?w=7680&amp;ssl=1 7680w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_319140527.jpeg?resize=300%2C169&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_319140527.jpeg?resize=768%2C432&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_319140527.jpeg?resize=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_319140527.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_319140527.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1170px) 100vw, 1170px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">That study that Harvard researchers did shows us there is an important relationship between cortisol and testosterone.</p>
<p>They work against each other &#8211; and unless you get your stress levels down &#8211; cortisol is the winner.</p>
<p>Too much cortisol can cause something called <em><strong>Testosterone Suppression Response (TSR.)</strong></em></p>
<p>Basically, this means that no matter how much testosterone you’re making, if you have too much cortisol, you will struggle with TSR and continue to have the consequences of low testosterone, even if you have plenty!</p>
<p>Effects like…<br />
Loss of muscle mass .. low sex drive .. inability to lose fat .. poor sleep quality .. etc.</p>
<p>As a result, even if you use testosterone boosters, it may not matter if your cortisol is elevated.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>HOW TO CURB THE TESTOSTERONE SUPPRESSION RESPONSE (TSR)</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Your most important line of defense is lowering your cortisol levels.</p>
<p>We put together a <a href="https://sculptnation.com/testboost">2-minute at home test</a> you can take to help determine if you have too much cortisol. We will tell you where you can go to take that in just a moment.</p>
<p>First, we want to give you a couple of methods to lower cortisol and fight TSR….</p>
<p><strong>Manage Stress Levels (mental and physical)</strong><br />
The most effective way to lower your cortisol levels is to get your stress under control. Stress is not just mental .. it can be any physical stress you are placing on your body as well.</p>
<p><strong>Focus on quality sleep</strong><br />
You need 7-9 hours of quality sleep every single night (minimum) to keep your cortisol levels in check. This can be virtually impossible if your cortisol is high because cortisol regulates your sleep/wake cycle.</p>
<p><strong>These changes are challenging to adhere to!</strong> Avoiding cortisol spiking stressors is pretty much IMPOSSIBLE! We face stress every day. Even dieting and exercising can cause your body to be “stressed out.” And how can you get quality sleep if your sleep/wake cycle is messed up!?</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>Thankfully… THERE IS ONE OTHER WAY TO HELP FIGHT BACK!!!</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>Focus on diet &amp; supplementing with cortisol lowering/test boosting support supplements…</strong></em> There are some nutrients you can take daily that help support a reduction in cortisol levels, as well as a few foods you should try to TOTALLY AVOID.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://sculptnation.com/testboost" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>CLICK HERE to discover&#8230;</strong></em></a><br />
<em><strong>AN EASY and SCIENTIFICALLY backed way to give your body the </strong></em><br />
<em><strong>cortisol crushing nutrients it needs&#8230;</strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>The 4 foods you need to avoid…</strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>A 2-minute quiz to help you determine if your cortisol is high ..</strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>++ More on that groundbreaking testosterone/cortisol study&#8230;</strong></em></p>
<p>Researchers also found that the effects cortisol have on testosterone are reversed when stress levels go down.</p>
<p>This is GOOD NEWS! Now that we know that high cortisol blocking your testosterone IS an issue… we can fight back!!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>In this video, we explain everything you need to know about TSR and </strong></em><br />
<em><strong>an effective approach to knocking it out! </strong></em><br />

<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>THE LONGER YOU WAIT &#8211; THE WORSE THINGS WILL GET</strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Your body will continue to struggle as this testosterone suppression response continues, and it will only get worse if you don&#8217;t take charge and destroy your ability to make and use testosterone.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>Boosting your testosterone is great, but it’s a complete waste of time</strong></em><br />
<em><strong>if you aren’t blocking cortisol too.</strong></em></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We all share something in common.</p>
<p>Regardless of race, gender, age, or demographic .. there is a worldwide health issue that none of us are resistant to.</p>
<p><img class="wp-image-6993 size-full" src="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_323879183.jpeg?resize=1170%2C780&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1170" height="780" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_323879183.jpeg?w=6436&amp;ssl=1 6436w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_323879183.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_323879183.jpeg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_323879183.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_323879183.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_323879183.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1170px) 100vw, 1170px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>There will be seasons of life that present more tension than others and we all wake up on the wrong side of the bed from time to time.</p>
<p>One or two days of mounting pressure here and there shouldn’t compromise your health, but stressing out more days than not… <em><strong>can take a serious toll on your mind, body, and spirit.</strong></em></p>
<p>The most recent data gathered by <a href="http://www.gostress.com/stress-facts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Global Organization for Stress</a> found that “75% of adults in the United States reported experiencing moderate to high levels of stress in the past month, and nearly half reported that their stress has increased in the past year.”</p>
<p>Stress is, no doubt, a pervasive problem. Still, yet, we tend to brush off the dangers it can cause and continue to live overwhelmed.</p>
<p><em><strong>April is STRESS AWARENESS MONTH</strong></em>&#8230;. an annual time when healthcare professionals and mental health experts from all over the country come together to increase public awareness about the harmful effects stress can have and the ways to combat it.</p>
<p>We’re sure you don’t need a month on your already jam-packed calendars to tell you that we are a stressed-out nation. But it’s great to have a reminder to step back and look at why you may be on edge and examine ways to properly manage (and limit) stressful moments.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>We can’t totally avoid stressors&#8230; </strong></em><br />
<em><strong>but we can take charge of how we deal with them.</strong></em></p>

<p>In this article, we are going to go over …</p>
<ul>
<li>The definition of “chronic” stress.</li>
<li>Ways chronic stress can negatively impact your health and waistline.</li>
<li>How to recognize the effects of chronic stress.</li>
<li>Ways to manage stress before (and when) it consumes you.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>WHAT IS “CHRONIC” STRESS</strong><br />
Not all stress is bad. If you know how to properly manage stressful situations, a little bit of adrenaline can give you a boost that helps you perform better.</p>
<p>Stress is a natural reaction. When our body senses danger, it is flooded with an increase in several hormones. Your “fight or flight” response kicks in. This isn’t negative as long as you don’t STAY in this zone.</p>
<p>Short term stress (also known as acute stress) typically comes and goes so quickly that it doesn’t result in any long-term adverse effects.</p>
<p>Chronic stress is different. This type of stress is ongoing.<em><strong> It is a constant rush of stress hormones that can be debilitating to your mental and physical health.</strong></em></p>
<p>Chronic stress doesn’t have to come as a result of a major traumatic event. In fact, it’s everyday routine pressures that leave most people, “chronically stressed.”</p>
<p>When your “fight or flight” mode stays “on” for an extended time (or kicks in too often) … that is when you are in a danger zone.</p>
<p>Being in constant “panic mode” presents an opportunity for every system in your body to be affected … either directly or indirectly.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-6995 size-full" src="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_229647193.jpeg?resize=1170%2C658&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1170" height="658" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_229647193.jpeg?w=3840&amp;ssl=1 3840w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_229647193.jpeg?resize=300%2C169&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_229647193.jpeg?resize=768%2C432&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_229647193.jpeg?resize=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_229647193.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_229647193.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1170px) 100vw, 1170px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><strong>HOW CHRONIC STRESS AFFECTS THE BODY</strong><br />
The longer your body is &#8220;stressed,&#8221; the more significant the impact it will have on your mind and body.</p>
<p>Everyone deals with pressure differently. This varies from person to person based on if the stress is “situational” or “routine” .. and of course your personality type.</p>
<p>Our bodies can handle a little bit of stress. But, we are not designed to manage chronic stress without consequence.</p>
<p>Some ways chronic stress can impact your health include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Weight Gain</li>
<li>Mental Health Problems</li>
<li>GI Issues</li>
<li>Low Libido (and other sexual dysfunctions)</li>
<li>Skin and Hair Problems</li>
<li>Developing bad habits (using alcohol, tobacco, drugs, etc.) as a way to cope.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>HOW TO RECOGNIZE THE EFFECTS OF CHRONIC STRESS</strong><br />
Because we are presented with stressful situations every day, it can sometimes be challenging to determine if you are just a little uptight and in a lousy mood, or if your stress has gotten out of control.</p>
<p>The sooner you realize your stress has moved into a “chronic” state .. the better chance you have to avoid the health hazards it can create.</p>
<p>Because people handle stress differently, everyone&#8217;s symptoms may be different.</p>
<p>Here are a few signs that your stress levels have potentially gone from manageable to chronic:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Extreme fatigue</strong></li>
<li><strong>Inability to concentrate</strong></li>
<li><strong>Racing thoughts</strong></li>
<li><strong>Constant worry</strong></li>
<li><strong>Low motivation</strong></li>
<li><strong>Irritability</strong></li>
<li><strong>A drastic shift in mood (always sad or angry)</strong></li>
<li><strong>Digestive issues</strong></li>
<li><strong>Headaches</strong></li>
<li><strong>Tense muscles</strong></li>
<li><strong>Chest tightness/pain</strong></li>
<li><strong>Blurred vision</strong></li>
<li><strong>Problems falling and staying asleep</strong></li>
<li><strong>Changes in sex drive</strong></li>
<li><strong>A weakened immune system</strong></li>
<li><strong>Unexplained weight gain (or loss)</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>WAYS TO MANAGE STRESS</strong><br />
It may seem like you&#8217;re doomed to live a life full of mounting pressure .. especially if your stressors are something you can’t prevent or control.</p>
<p>Remember, just because you can’t avoid stress, does not mean you can’t be better equipped to deal with it. <em><strong>You have more control than you realize!</strong></em></p>
<p>Of course, stress management is not one-size-fits-all. It may take some experimenting to figure out what calms you the most.</p>

<p><img class="size-large wp-image-7021" src="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_283771005.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_283771005.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_283771005.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_283771005.jpeg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_283771005.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_283771005.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><strong>1. Recognize, Admit, Accept &amp; Take Ownership</strong><br />
Stop saying, <em>“I’m fine”</em> and admit that you could probably chill out a little.</p>
<p>If you don’t acknowledge you are overwhelmed, you can’t take appropriate action steps to get things under control.</p>
<p>Every time you notice any of the “stress symptoms” mentioned above, admit you are stressed and take note of what is causing you to become frazzled.</p>
<p>Some stressors are easy to identify (job loss, moving, a break-up, chronic illness, etc.)<br />
In these situations, the best thing you can do is accept that it is happening and focus on the things you can control, such as the way you choose to react.</p>
<p>Other causes of stress are more difficult to pinpoint.<br />
It is easy to look past the actions, thoughts, and feelings that are keeping you uptight. Be honest with yourself, and consider that the real cause of your stress could originate from your own bad attitude, unhealthy habits, or excuses.</p>
<p>Once you have a list of your stress triggers and ways that you are contributing… start looking at ways you can eliminate.</p>
<p>If it’s not impossible to rid yourself of the source, you have to learn to manage the stress it causes.</p>
<p><strong>The next 7 steps will help with that.</strong></p>

<p><strong>2. Get regular exercise</strong><br />
There is a reason that many people call workouts .. therapy. Exercise can provide a healthy distraction and research proves that those who workout regularly are much less anxious than those who do not.</p>
<p>Being active reduces stress hormones and releases the brains “feel good” chemicals &#8230; called endorphins. This rush can elevate your mood and decrease tension.</p>
<p>You can up the “happy” by taking some of your workouts outdoors! Natural sunlight can boost mood and help regulate your circadian rhythm to promote a good night’s rest.</p>
<p>Sleep is even more important when you are stressed out, because tension can cause your cortisol (stress hormone) to skyrocket!</p>
<p>One of the best ways to combat that and keep your cortisol in a healthy range&#8230; is with quality sleep!</p>
<p>For more info on supporting healthy, quality sleep.. <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/how-to-burn-fat-while-you-sleep-wake-up-leaner/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">check out these tips</a>!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><em><strong>The calming benefits of exercise are strongest when you exercise regularly. </strong></em><br />
<em><strong>Build some sort of regular activity into your daily routine.</strong></em></p>
<p>We have tons of workouts on our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCOFCwvhDoUvYcfpD7RJKQwA?view_as=subscriber" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">YouTube Channel</a>.

<p>Whatever exercise you choose, make sure it’s something you can implement with ease and enjoy. <em><strong>You certainly don’t want exercise to cause any additional stress!!</strong></em></p>

<p><strong>3. Meditation</strong><br />
Practicing meditation does wonders for not only relaxing your mind… but shifting your focus from negative to positive.</p>
<p>Making time for your spiritual health can allow you to see things from a new, and much calmer perspective (more on perspective in tip #8 below.)</p>
<p>Find a quiet place and spend at least 10 minutes in the present moment. Allow any anxious or negative thoughts to come in, and then use your personal practice of meditation to release them.</p>
<p><em><strong>Words are powerful</strong></em>. Set positivity into motion by speaking positive hope-filled words instead of fear-filled words. Say it, believe for it!</p>
<p><img class="wp-image-7001 size-full" src="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_330846998.jpeg?resize=1170%2C780&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1170" height="780" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_330846998.jpeg?w=5760&amp;ssl=1 5760w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_330846998.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_330846998.jpeg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_330846998.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_330846998.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_330846998.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1170px) 100vw, 1170px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><strong>4. Try Journaling</strong><br />
The simple act of writing things down and “getting them off your chest” has been proven to significantly reduce stress.</p>
<p>Writing down the way you feel helps clear your mind, organize your thoughts, and gives meaning to the things weighing you down.</p>
<p>There is no right or wrong way to journal. Start writing all of your thoughts and emotions, but don’t only use your journal as a way to vent.</p>
<p><em><strong>Keeping a journal is most beneficial if you also make time to focus on the positive.</strong></em></p>
<p>Write down things you are grateful for, and at least one positive that is happening, or could happen, as a result of your stressors.</p>
<p>Include ways you can improve your reactions, outcomes you would like to see, and lessons you would like to learn from your hardships.</p>
<p>It is just as important to be positive in your writing as it is to release the negative.</p>
<p>If you find it difficult to concentrate while journaling, check out <a href="https://sculptnation.com/neuroctane" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this article</a> for some helpful tips to enhance mental clarity. Our brain is continually going, going, going. Like any other muscle, it needs to be fueled to function at top capacity.</p>

<p><strong>5. Breathing Techniques</strong><br />
One of the most powerful tools for returning to a calm state of mind after a moment of stress is incorporating breathing exercises.</p>
<p>These techniques work by activating a part of the nervous system that controls your relaxation response.</p>
<p>There are many apps and methods out there.</p>
<p>Here are two of our favorites.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/lung-health-and-disease/learning-diaphragmatic-breathing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Belly Breathing:</strong></a><br />
Start by sitting or lying down. Take a deep breath through your nose until your chest is full and your belly expands.. then slowly exhale. You should begin to feel relaxing effects after just a few breaths.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=8&amp;v=gz4G31LGyog&amp;feature=emb_logo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The 4-7-8 Method:</a></strong><br />
While sitting or lying in a comfortable position, empty all of the air out of your lungs.<br />
Breathe in through your nose for 4 seconds, hold the breath for 7 seconds, and then exhale forcefully through your mouth for 8 seconds. Repeat the cycle up to 4 times.</p>
<p>Both of these methods can regulate your heart rate, lower your stress hormones (cortisol), and almost instantly reverse the stress response.</p>

<p><strong>6. Set Limits</strong><br />
One major cause of stress is being pulled in a million different directions.</p>
<p>Stress levels are almost always parallel to the number of items on your to-do list. However, it’s not so much the ITEMS on your agenda that causes stress, as much as it is your attachment to them or fears that they won’t have a particular outcome, or get checked off.</p>
<p>Ask yourself how important the outcome is, then determine what’s necessary and what’s not. Learn to SAY NO to the things that are not essential, or can be passed on to someone else.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><em><strong>Much of your stress is connected to the things that are left UNdone.</strong></em><br />
<em><strong>Instead of a TO DO list … maybe you should have an &#8230; I am NOT GONNA DO IT list!</strong></em></p>
<p>There are other boundaries (that do not involve your calendar) that you can set that will lower stress levels.</p>
<ul>
<li>Remove yourself from stressful situations that don’t directly involve you.</li>
<li>Limit negative screen time (the news, etc.)</li>
<li>Avoid being around negative or easily agitated people.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>7. Resist Isolation</strong><br />
Loneliness can make it difficult to deal with stress. The “empty” feelings that come about when we isolate ourselves can also make any stress you are under .. even worse.</p>
<p>It is important to connect with people that make you feel calm, happy, and can offer a listening ear.</p>
<p>Researchers found that social interactions release a natural stress reliever called oxytocin. This is a hormone (also known as the cuddle or love hormone) that is released when people bond socially. It counteracts the “fight-or-flight response we told you about at the beginning of this article.</p>
<p>We would normally tell you to limit your screen time and make IN PERSON connections, but in times of social distancing, this may not be possible.</p>
<p>For now, take advantage of technology and have regular phone and video chat dates.</p>
<p>Use social media as well, but be cautious of what accounts you follow. Delete or mute pages that make you feel any sort of pressure and follow accounts that promote positivity.</p>

<p><strong>8. Shift Your Perspective</strong><br />
<em>“People are disturbed not by a thing, but by their perception of a thing.” — Epictetus.</em></p>
<p>What a great quote and principal to apply to our lives.</p>
<p>Our thoughts are not usually fact. We allow our minds to go to places it should never be.<br />
When overwhelmed&#8230; it’s easy to become negative and cynical. Shifting your perspective and being positive can be one of your greatest weapons.</p>
<p>One study at the University of Michigan tested this philosophy with combat soldiers and found that those that were less negative in their thinking and more hopeful functioned better during difficult times.</p>
<p>When faced with something that makes you feel uptight .. ask yourself …</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Is it really worth the panic?</em></li>
<li><em>How important will this be in a week, a month, a year?</em></li>
<li><em>How will stressing out change the situation?</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Now, take those questions a step further and ask yourself how your reaction can make the situation proactive/positive!</p>
<ul>
<li><em>What can I learn from the situation?</em></li>
<li><em>What is the potential silver lining?</em></li>
<li><em>Is there something within the stressor that I can also be grateful for?</em></li>
</ul>
<p><em><strong>Stress can be debilitating if you allow it.</strong></em> Changing the way you look at the situations you face can be the difference in your blood boiling&#8230; or you coming out of the storm a stronger and better person.</p>
