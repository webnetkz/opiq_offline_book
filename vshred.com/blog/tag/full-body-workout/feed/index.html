								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3 style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>Thank You V Shred Family: Celebrating 2-Million YouTube Subscribers With A Special Discount &amp; Brand New Workout!</strong></em></h3>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-7394" src="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/ezgif-5-dffd30744146.gif?resize=600%2C600&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="600" height="600" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>We are kind of at a loss for words.</p>
<p>If you had told us in 2015 when we first started our journey to change millions of lives through a health and fitness channel on YouTube  that we would reach<strong> 2-MILLION SUBSCRIBERS</strong> with over 450 million total views and counting in just 5 short years we probably wouldn’t have believed you.</p>
<p>We knew we had lofty goals and knew we would reach them one day, but honestly we thought the milestone we just reached was going to take much longer.</p>
<p>Yet, because of you here we are.</p>
<p>In only 5 years, we have created one of the world’s most popular fitness YouTube Channels and just recently hit <strong>2-Million Subscribers!</strong></p>
<p><!-- instagram error: invalid instagram resource --></p>
<p>It all started on March 2015… Four guys with a vision to simplify training and put the fun back in fitness.</p>
<p>Four guys that just wanted to show people that they can transform their body without endless hours in the gym and rabbit food diets.</p>
<p>Four guys that wanted to help people better their health and build self-confidence.</p>
<p>Now four people wanting to change lives has grown to a family of 2-MILLION from all over the world, and that is on YouTube alone.</p>
<p>We also have millions of social media followers, hundreds-of-thousands of custom training clients in 120+ countries, and have seen more people than we can count transform their bodies using our free YouTube workouts, free body-type quiz, and digital fitness programs.</p>

<p>Second .. I know our YouTube subscribers have been waiting on some new workout videos to hit the channel.</p>
<p>We have been working hard behind the scenes putting all that together and have a ton of content we are anxious to post.</p>

<p>The heavier the DBs you use, or the greater the resistance of the bands, the harder the workout will be!</p>
<p>Or you can skip out on any equipment and only use your body weight!</p>
<p>Set a timer for 10 Minutes and repeat this 10 move circuit as many times as possible without resting! <strong>Let’s Go!</strong></p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='1170' height='659' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/BtO8xt9z6PE?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>10 Min AT HOME Full Body Workout</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Goblet Squat w/shoulder press &#8211; 10 reps</li>
<li>Reverse Lunges w/bicep curl &#8211; 10 reps each side</li>
<li>Lateral Squats w/tricep kickback &#8211; 10 reps each side &#8211; 1 tricep kickback between sides</li>
<li>3-way-raise (lateral-to front-to upright) &#8211; 10 reps (one rep is all three)</li>
<li>Push-Ups &#8211; to shoulder taps &#8211; 10 reps (one rep is after push up, and shoulder tap each arm)</li>
<li>Glute Bridge &#8211; 10 reps followed by ISO hold</li>
<li>Superman Pulses &#8211; 30 seconds &#8211; followed by ISO hold</li>

<li>Mountain Climbers &#8211; 30 seconds</li>
<li>Plank &#8211; 30 seconds</li>
</ul>
<p>You will keep repeating this with NO REST until your TEN MINUTE TIMER IS UP! This 10 min workout will burn even more calories if you use dumbbells or resistance bands. You don’t always need fancy gym equipment or a large wide open space to get in a killer sweat session!</p>
<p>This workout is only 10 minutes so make sure you PUSH YOURSELF!! You can make an excuse, or you can MAKE time!</p>
<p>ONE MORE IMPORTANT THING….<br />
While this workout is great to throw in when you are “in a pinch” and will no doubt make anyone work up a sweat and blast some major calories, when it comes to achieving optimal results, you need a long term plan that you can adhere to more days than not.</p>
<p>It needs to factor in your personal starting point, your end goal, and, most importantly, your body type.</p>
<p>We have a <a href="https://vshred.com/sp/survey/survey-aka1/">FREE BODY TYPE QUIZ</a> that you can take that will take all the guesswork out and show you exactly how you should train and eat to fuel YOUR body!</p>
<p>We know if you are reading this you are probably already strapped for time.<br />
Don’t worry! <a href="https://vshred.com/sp/survey/survey-aka1/">The FREE BODY TYPE QUIZ</a> is only FIVE QUESTIONS.</p>
<p>Once you complete it, you will finally have the mystery taken out of how you should train and eat! So think of this quiz as only a few moments of your day that will give you back hours of time and stress later down the road!</p>
<p>DON’T FORGET ABOUT OUR SPECIAL THANK YOU &#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>We are giving you 30% off your Sculpt Nation order with codE: 2MILL30</strong><br />
<strong>So go stock up on all your favorites before the code expires! <a href="https://sculptnation.com/products">CLICK HERE TO SHOP!</a></strong></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>Burn More Calories By Taking Your Workout Outdoors This Memorial Day</strong></em></p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-7152" src="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_334018142.jpeg?resize=1170%2C780&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1170" height="780" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_334018142.jpeg?w=6720&amp;ssl=1 6720w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_334018142.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_334018142.jpeg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_334018142.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_334018142.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_334018142.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1170px) 100vw, 1170px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>It is officially (unofficial) .. <em><strong>summer is here!!</strong></em></p>
<p>Memorial Day marks the unofficial start of summer, and I don’t know about you, but I’m excited to take some of my workouts outside!</p>
<p>Today we’ve got a full-body workout that you can do from your backyard or wherever your Memorial Day weekend takes you!</p>
<p>It doesn’t require any equipment. We are using bodyweight only, and it can be adjusted to any fitness level!</p>
<p>Of course, you can do this working indoors if you choose, but as long as you are hydrated, try breaking a sweat outside!</p>
<p>Taking your workouts outdoors has a ton of benefits .. here are a few!</p>
<p><strong>3 BENEFITS OF EXERCISING OUTSIDE</strong></p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-7153" src="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_222896530.jpeg?resize=1170%2C780&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1170" height="780" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_222896530.jpeg?w=5040&amp;ssl=1 5040w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_222896530.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_222896530.jpeg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_222896530.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_222896530.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_222896530.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1170px) 100vw, 1170px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><strong>1: You May Burn More Calories</strong><br />
Some small studies found outdoor exercisers burn a few more calories than those who exercise indoors. The theory is that exercising outdoors exerts more energy.</p>
<p>Be careful.. this could have the opposite effect if you are attempting to workout when temperatures are extreme.</p>
<p>Working out when it’s too hot could affect your endurance. You may also be more tempted to shorten the duration of your workout.</p>
<p>Try doing your outdoor workouts early in the morning before temperatures spike, or later in the evening.</p>
<p>Always stay extra hydrated and above all.. listen to your body!</p>
<p><strong>2: It Could Cheer You Up</strong><br />
Hundreds of studies have shown that soaking up the sun and being surrounded by mother nature helps alleviate stress and improve overall mood!</p>
<p>Exercising outdoors has even been shown to enhance your brain! Researchers say this is because being outside stimulates all five senses at once &#8211; something that can’t be achieved inside a gym or your living room.</p>
<p>Head outside .. breathe in some fresh air .. take a moment to appreciate the beauty around you! Maybe even take off your headphones and listen to the sounds of nature!</p>
<p>A little natural Vitamin D is no doubt a great motivator to get moving!</p>
<p><strong>3: It Saves You Money</strong><br />
Gym memberships are not cheap. Not to mention, they often go unused.</p>
<p>How many times have you paid for a year and only showed up once or twice a week, or even worse, gone months without entering a building that you pay to use?</p>
<p>If you can go every day, a gym membership is no doubt worth the money. But despite what most believe, it’s not required to get in a solid training session.</p>
<p>That is why we focus on so many home workouts on our <strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/vshred" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">YouTube Channel</a></strong>, and why we recently created an entire program called <a href="https://vshred.com/sp/move/soc-all" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MOVE</a> that can be done from home.

<p>This fat-blasting workout consists of only 5 exercises. You will do all of them back-to-back without resting.</p>
<p>Once the entire circuit is complete, take a quick 30-second break before starting over again! You don’t want to rest any longer than that. The goal is to keep your heart rate up as high as possible.</p>
<p>Repeat the circuit as many times as you want. Don’t focus on the duration&#8230; just give it your all and keep going <strong>until you can’t do another round!</strong></p>
<p><strong>Exercise One:</strong> Dive Bomber Push Ups &#8211; 5 reps<br />
<strong>Exercise Two:</strong> Alternating Jump Lunges &#8211; 10 reps each leg<br />
<strong>Exercise Three:</strong> Spiderman Pushups &#8211; 5 reps each side<br />
<strong>Exercise Four:</strong> Crab Kicks &#8211; 5 reps each side<br />
<strong>Exercise Five:</strong> Pulse Squats &#8211; 30 seconds</p>
<p>Challenge yourself every round by going faster and harder! Or if you are doing this workout with your friends or family &#8211; see who can finish the most rounds in a set amount of time!</p>
