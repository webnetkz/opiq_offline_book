<p>If you have a lot of weight to lose, or if you are just trying to lose that last layer of fat covering your mid-section, THIS <em><strong><a href="https://sculptnation.com/products/fat-loss-stack" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FAT LOSS STACK</a> could help!</strong></em></p>
<p>Now, of course, you can’t just take some supplements and do this short ab workout we are about to show you, and expect to be shredded.</p>
<p>You have to exercise and follow a nutrition plan that is best for your body type. If you aren’t sure what yours is .. check out this <strong><a href="https://vshred.com/sp/survey/survey-aka1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FREE QUIZ</a></strong>! It will tell you what your body type is and give you 3 most important things you need to do to get in shape based on the way YOU are built!</p>
<p>If you have put off getting in shape for summer, you may be tempted to set unrealistic goals or turn to some silly quick-fix detox diet… <em><strong>don’t do that!</strong></em></p>
<p>First of all, there is no such thing. Second, no matter what your short-term goals are, your focus should always be on long-term success.</p>
<p>Training and eating for <a href="https://vshred.com/sp/survey/survey-aka1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">your body type</a> will always be the best way to achieve that!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>Now that we’ve covered the most important bases to help you reveal that summer six-pack… let’s get to BUILDING your abs … with this killer core workout!</strong></em></p>

<p>Since the sun is finally shining brighter and temperatures are rising a bit, we want to encourage you to<em><strong> take some of your workouts OUTDOORS!</strong></em></p>
<p>Lack of motivation is one of the biggest reasons people skip training. There&#8217;s nothing quite like surrounding yourself with nature and breathing in some fresh air. It is the perfect motivator to get you moving!</p>
<p>Being outdoors helps lower stress, clears your mind, improves happiness, and according to some studies, can even up your calorie burn a little bit!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>Put on some SPF, pound some <a href="https://sculptnation.com/products/pre-workout" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pre-workout</a> to help you push through, </strong></em><br />
<em><strong>head outside to a nice even spot in the grass, and follow along for this</strong></em><br />
