<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1"><strong><a href="https://vshred.com/sp/survey/survey-aka1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">If you’re looking to get in shape, you must follow a plan for your body type. Click Here to take our free body type quiz and to find out yours now!</a></strong></p>
<p class="p1">Just like any body part, the body adapts to repetitive exercise. This is why when you run the first week, you see results. But then you run the same amount the following weeks and the results slow down.</p>
<p class="p1">When the basics no longer work like they once did, it’s time to start switching up your training. Try doing HIIT workouts a few times a week rather than your traditional cardio. This may lead to you putting your fat loss in hyperdrive.</p>
<h2 class="p1">HIIT Workout Plan</h2>
<p class="p1">HIIT stands for high intensity interval training. This is a cardio method that has been used to decades by people aiming to lower their body fat fast.</p>
<p class="p1">When doing a HIIT workout, you will cycle between high/max intensity intervals and low intensity/rest intervals. Each of these intervals will be less than a minute each.. sometimes even as short as 10-20 seconds but you must put your full effort into it.</p>
<p class="p1">When done correctly, a full workout should be completed in about 10/15 minutes. By doing this, you create a metabolic response in your body. This metabolic response ramps up your caloric expenditure for hours after your workout.</p>
<p class="p1">So try it 2-3 times a week and watch the fat melt!</p>
<h3 class="p1">The Workout:</h3>
<p class="p1">This HIIT workout plan will consist of only 4 exercises. You will perform each exercise for 50 seconds. Then follow up the exercise with a 10 second rest.</p>
<p class="p1">Make sure you do not extend the rest any longer than 10 seconds! It should be just enough time to get ready for your next exercise!</p>
<h4 class="p1">The Exercises:</h4>
<ul>
<li class="p1"><strong>Single Leg Burpees</strong></li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">Act as if you are going to do a regular burpee, but instead of going down to the ground with two feet back, you will only use one. Alternate legs and repeat as many times as you can for the full 50 seconds.</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1"><strong>Plank Jacks</strong></li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">For this exercise, you will start in regular plank position. From there you will hop your lower body up off the ground and widen your legs. Then immediately after, you will hop your lower body off the ground and bring your feet back together. Repeat for as many reps as you can do for the full 50 seconds.</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1"><strong>Hand Release Push Ups</strong></li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">This exercise is meant to be treated like an explosive rest/pause type exercise. Meaning you will start in regular pushup position. You will then lower yourself to the ground until you are able to pick your hands up off the ground. (This will act as a one second rest for your chest.) Then you will place your hands back on the ground and do an explosive pushup. Repeat as many times as you can for the full 50 seconds.</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1"><strong>Tuck Ups</strong></li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">For this exercise, you will start by laying flat on your back. From here, you will take your upper body and your knees and bring them together to meet in the middle. Be sure to find a good spot on your tailbone so you can balance on the ground without any pain. After you have tucked your knees into your arms, you will lower yourself back down to the ground. Repeat as many times as you can for the full 50 seconds.</p>
<p class="p1">Just one round of this workout, when done correctly, will quick HIIT workout plan will leave your heart rate skyrocketed!</p>
