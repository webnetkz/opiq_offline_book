<p>Summer is here and the sun is out! With the summer sun comes swimsuits, and swimsuits mean your body is going to be on full display.</p>
<p>Unlike the fellas, who can cover up their REAR VIEW in a pair of swim trunks, ladies have to expose it all.</p>
<p><em><strong>Not fair .. we know.</strong></em></p>
<p>BUT we’ve got you covered (so you can confidently be uncovered) &#8211; with a <em><strong>12-minute home glute workout</strong></em> &#8211; that will help you blast fat and build curves in all the right places!</p>
<p><em><strong>Speaking of the summer sun….</strong></em><br />
While the weather is pleasant, try leaving your living room and take your training outside!<br />
The fresh air and bright sunshine can be a great motivator to get moving!</p>
<p><em><strong>Studies say being outdoors….</strong></em></p>
<ul>
<li>Lowers stress hormones (which can impact things like appetite and weight)</li>
<li>Re-sets your ability to focus &amp; boosts creativity</li>
<li>Supports immune health</li>
<li>May help you burn a few more calories (because of the extra energy required.)</li>
<li>++ More</li>
</ul>
<p>Outdoor training may not be ideal for every workout, but the one we are showing you today is really short &#8211; only 12-minutes!</p>
<p>Don’t forget your sunscreen and plenty of water! Let’s get that summer booty poppin!</p>
<p>You don’t need any equipment for this workout, but if you have some weights or bands, feel free to add them.</p>
<p>We will perform all exercises as “super-sets” .. this means you will do “Exercise A &amp; B” without any rest in-between. Then you will get a quick break before moving on to the next superset, and so on.</p>
<p>The reason we are doing supersets is to keep things moving. This keeps your heart-rate up and will ensure you are getting the most out of your time.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>12-Minute Follow Along Booty Movements </strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Each exercise will be performed for 20 Seconds. Your rest periods between supersets will also be a quick 20-seconds.</p>
