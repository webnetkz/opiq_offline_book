<p>Motherhood is a mix of many things….<br />
It is a blessing, but it can also be frustrating, hectic, and at times, even monotonous.<br />
It is beautiful knowing that you are helping shape a future generation, but that also brings about a lot of pressure and responsibility.</p>
<p>You are always going mentally and physically, which means just like any other job, burnout is bound to happen<em><strong> if you don’t s-l-o-w down!!</strong></em></p>
<p>If you are a mom reading this… we want you to ask yourself a few important questions.</p>
<ul>
<li>When is the last time I put my needs first?</li>
<li>Do I regularly focus on self-care?</li>
<li>Do I have a good mom/life balance?</li>
</ul>
<p>You likely answered…</p>
<ul>
<li>Rarely/Never</li>
<li>No, not regularly.</li>
<li>What is life .. outside of being a mom?</li>
</ul>
<p>Being a mom has required responsibilities, but you have to stop and think about <em><strong>your own needs</strong></em>. Going non-stop can take a toll on both your mental and physical health.</p>
<p>How can you be SUPERMOM if you aren’t taking time to REST and RECHARGE?</p>
<p><strong>Easier said than done, right?</strong><br />
It SOUNDS great to be able to pour a glass of wine, put on a face mask, jump in a bubble bath, and turn on a meditation app.</p>
<p>In REALITY, you haven’t had time to go to the store to get groceries, your kid’s toys are still in the tub that you haven’t had time to clean, and if you do manage to hop in, forget silence. It won’t be long before there is a little knock at the door, interrupting your zen!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>BUT MOMS… LISTEN UP!</strong></p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-7087" src="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_221068765.jpeg?resize=1170%2C780&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1170" height="780" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_221068765.jpeg?w=6500&amp;ssl=1 6500w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_221068765.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_221068765.jpeg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_221068765.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_221068765.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_221068765.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1170px) 100vw, 1170px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>To be able to take care of everyone else, you have to feel your best both physically and mentally.</p>
<p>Self-care is not selfish .. it’s actually the opposite.<em><strong> A happy and fulfilled mom .. is no doubt a better mom!</strong></em></p>
<p>Use Mother’s Day as a reminder that YOU ARE SPECIAL and deserve just as much TLC as everyone else in your family!</p>
<p>Here are FIVE IDEAS that will help give you the mental and physical energy needed to tackle both the chaos and glory that make up motherhood!!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>5 Ways To Focus On Self-Care This Mother’s Day</strong></p>
<p>Self-Care is a personal process. What helps you unwind may be different than what helps somebody else de-stress. However, these 5 self-care tips are things ALL busy moms should consider.</p>
<p>Remember, self-care isn’t just a day at the spa or date night without the kids.<br />
It is ANY activity you do that will improve your mental, spiritual, and physical health.</p>
<p>In fact, the best types of self-care aren’t about only feeling good in the moment. Just like your health and fitness journey… the ultimate goal of self-care should be its long-term effects!</p>
<p><strong>1: DISCONNECT</strong></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-7088" src="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_338261185.jpeg?resize=1170%2C780&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1170" height="780" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_338261185.jpeg?w=7776&amp;ssl=1 7776w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_338261185.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_338261185.jpeg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_338261185.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_338261185.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_338261185.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1170px) 100vw, 1170px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>Put your computer away, turn off your phone, don’t tune into the news, and click out of Netflix.</p>
<p>Sometimes the most effective thing you can do for yourself has little to do with what TO DO and more to do with what you DO NOT DO!</p>
<p>While it is great to be informed and socially connected .. <em><strong>too much time plugged in can add to your stress, anxiety, and life fears.</strong></em></p>
<p>This is especially true for social media. It is one thing if you <em><strong>only</strong></em> follow accounts that motivate you and feed you with positivity. But many of us “follow” the lives of others and end up comparing, leading to feelings of not being good enough.</p>
<p>Social media can also be a rabbit hole of negativity and biased opinions, leaving you confused, negative, anxious, uptight, and even angry. <em><strong>Put yourself on a social media diet and limit your screen-time and scrolling.</strong></em></p>
<p>The same “digital detox” rules should also apply for TV time. The news (especially these days) can only fuel your fears.<em><strong> If you must watch, tune in only to be informed and immediately power off!</strong></em></p>
<p>If binge-watching Netflix is how you like to unwind, go for it! But the next time you have watched enough episodes for it to ask you &#8211; “are you still watching” &#8211; consider doing something else relaxing that could be more beneficial to your long term mental health.</p>
<p>Take up a new hobby you would enjoy, journal, call a friend, read a book, maybe even try those “stress relieving” adult coloring books!</p>
<p><strong>2: GET REGULAR SLEEP</strong></p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-7089" src="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_233195435.jpeg?resize=1170%2C781&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1170" height="781" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_233195435.jpeg?w=7360&amp;ssl=1 7360w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_233195435.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_233195435.jpeg?resize=768%2C513&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_233195435.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_233195435.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_233195435.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1170px) 100vw, 1170px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>In an attempt to do as much as possible with the 24 hours given, most moms sacrifice sleep and end up sleep-deprived.</p>
<p>While it may seem like the only way to get everything done, exhaustion only slows you down, making you less productive while you are awake.</p>
<p>Getting quality shut-eye is crucial to maintaining your physical and mental health. 7-9 hours of sleep is non-negotiable if you want to be able to have the clarity and energy needed to tackle your mile-long list of supermom tasks.</p>
<p>Even more than slowing down to get in bed, sometimes the ability to actually fall asleep is the biggest challenge busy moms face.</p>
<p>It is common to replay all the events of your stress-filled day or go over your endless mom to-do-list in your head.</p>
<p>Here are a few tips to help you get that critical shut-eye!</p>
<ul>
<li>Go back to self-care tip #1 and UNPLUG at least one-hour before bedtime.</li>
<li>Do 5-10 minutes of stretching or yoga.</li>
<li>Take a warm bath just before laying down.</li>
<li>Eat a <a href="https://sculptnation.com/products/protein" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">protein</a>-rich meal that isn’t too heavy.</li>
<li>Write in your journal, specifically a gratitude journal.</li>
<li>Try to be in bed around the same time every night.</li>
<li>Try some breathing techniques.</li>
<li>Use a weighted blanket.</li>
<li>Use Essential Oils &amp; Aromatherapy Machines</li>
<li>Incorporate natural <a href="https://sculptnation.com/products/burn-pm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">sleep-enhancing supplements</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Our favorite supplement for sleep is a product called <a href="https://sculptnation.com/products/burn-pm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BURN PM</a>.</p>

<p><strong>3: Perform A Health Check</strong></p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-7090" src="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_309968852.jpeg?resize=1170%2C780&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1170" height="780" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_309968852.jpeg?w=5472&amp;ssl=1 5472w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_309968852.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_309968852.jpeg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_309968852.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_309968852.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_309968852.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1170px) 100vw, 1170px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>You wouldn&#8217;t let your kids skip their yearly dental cleaning or wellness check, and you are probably constantly on to your significant other to see their primary care provider for an annual check-up. But are you too busy worrying about everyone else&#8217;s preventative health .. that you are forgetting about your own?</p>
<p>Take some time to look at your calendar and see when you can schedule YOUR regular doctor appointments for things like yearly blood work, exams, scans, cleanings, etc.</p>
<p>You should always try to be ahead of any potential health issues. Getting sick could leave you down and out for days or weeks … <em><strong>and we all know moms don’t get sick days!</strong></em></p>
<p>Book those yearly check-ups, then head to your kitchen and take inventory of <em><strong>other ways you could improve your overall health through supplementation and diet.</strong></em></p>
<p>Stock your pantry and fridge with healthy choices that are easy to grab and go. We always keep a container of <a href="https://sculptnation.com/products/protein" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sculpt Nation Protein</a> on hand for shakes, smoothies, and even simple things like <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/pumpkin-spice-protein/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">protein pancakes</a>. This will ensure you are less tempted to reach for your kid’s snacks when you are too busy to cook.</p>
<p>Two of our favorite supplements that assist in optimizing overall health are <a href="https://sculptnation.com/products/greens" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GREENS</a> and <a href="https://sculptnation.com/products/turmeric" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TURMERIC</a>.</p>
<p>It is hard to get in the nutrients your body needs through diet alone. Adding quality <a href="https://sculptnation.com/products/greens" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GREENS</a> helps close that gap.</p>
<p><a href="https://sculptnation.com/products/greens" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sculpt Nation GREENS</a> is a delicious superfood that is packed with herbs, botanicals, antioxidants, and agents that support a healthy inflammatory response. Just one dose gives you an added boost of powerful superfoods.</p>
<p>In addition to assisting in revitalizing your mental and physical energy, our <a href="https://sculptnation.com/products/greens" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GREENS</a> help prime and support your body and brain to be able to better burn fat, build muscle, and increase performance.</p>
<p>Another supplement you may want to consider to stay healthy is <a href="https://sculptnation.com/products/turmeric" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TURMERIC</a>.</p>
<p>This super-nutrient has been used for centuries to optimize health. But in recent years, studies have found that turmeric goes beyond helping with things like temporary pain related to exercise or supporting a healthy inflammatory response. They discovered it can potentially assist in fighting fatigue, burning body fat, enhancing mental clarity, and help ease gastrointestinal issues such as occasional bloating.</p>
<p>Sculpt Nation&#8217;s <a href="https://sculptnation.com/products/turmeric" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TURMERIC</a> not only provides you with the exact dose you need to see and feel benefits, our proprietary blend includes other key nutrients required for this powerful herb to be absorbed.</p>
<p>That 30% off special Mother’s Day discount can also be used on these products!<br />

<p><strong>4: Exercise</strong></p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-7091" src="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_167087638.jpeg?resize=1170%2C695&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1170" height="695" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_167087638.jpeg?w=5759&amp;ssl=1 5759w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_167087638.jpeg?resize=300%2C178&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_167087638.jpeg?resize=768%2C456&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_167087638.jpeg?resize=1024%2C608&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_167087638.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_167087638.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1170px) 100vw, 1170px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>For some moms, a workout is the perfect escape. For others, working out may seem more like a chore than a treat.</p>
<p>Like it or not, exercise is one of the best (if not THE best) ways you can take care of yourself.</p>
<p>Getting in some sort of daily physical activity can enhance mood, reduce stress, and give you a major self-esteem boost!</p>
<p>The number one reason most moms skip the gym is that they can&#8217;t find the time.</p>
<p><em><strong>If inking in a sweat session seems impossible</strong></em>, you can always try INCLUDING your kids in your workout!</p>
<p>It may not be IDEAL .. or the escape you want .. but at least you will be able to get it done! <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/strong-as-a-mother-mommy-me-workouts-for-every-age/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Check out this article for OVER 30 kid-friendly exercise ideas!</a></p>
<p>So, get out of your comfy mom sweats, throw on some workout clothes, put on your favorite playlist, and get moving!</p>
<p>If you need some ideas that don’t involve your kids, we have thousands of FREE home workouts on our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/vshred" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">YouTube Channel</a>. Many can be done with no equipment and in 20 minutes or less!</p>
<p><strong>5: Do Nothing (Zero. Zilch. Nada.)</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-7121" src="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_307475146-1.jpeg?resize=1170%2C780&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1170" height="780" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_307475146-1.jpeg?w=5760&amp;ssl=1 5760w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_307475146-1.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_307475146-1.jpeg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_307475146-1.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_307475146-1.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_307475146-1.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1170px) 100vw, 1170px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Go to your room, sit outside, or even get in your car! Go anywhere you can find some peace and quiet and don’t do ANYTHING … other than closing your eyes and listening to your heart.</p>
<p>This is different from meditating, where you attempt to clear your mind of ANY thoughts.</p>
<p>With this type of mental mindfulness, you are simply slowing down long enough to listen to the desires hidden deep within you.</p>
<p>The purpose of this self-care exercise is not to leave you sad or anxious. The goal is to reconnect with yourself so that you can be more aware of any area of your life that may be lacking.</p>
<p>This is a great way to explore yourself to determine any areas of your life that are fulfilling and possibly lacking.</p>
<p>Think about things you love, ways you have been ignoring your needs and desires, and what you want out of your life … aside from being a good mom.</p>
<p>“Mom life” can get so busy that it’s common to forget who you are and what makes you happy.<br />
Take a moment to self-reflect!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>TAKE SOME TIME TO SELF CARE</strong><br />
<strong>AND</strong><br />
<strong>DO NOT FEEL GUILTY ABOUT IT!</strong></p>

<p>Far too often, moms are flooded with feelings of guilt when they actually do take time to break-free from mom life and take care of themselves.</p>
<p>Whether you decide to wake up 10 minutes early to sit and enjoy your cup of coffee alone before your crazy day begins, or take two hours to train and go to the spa, <em><strong>never feel guilty about time spent ON YOU!</strong></em></p>
<p>Self-care is an essential part of motherhood! The more time you can set aside to take care of your own needs, the happier you will be. Which will only bring more happiness, energy, and love to those around you!</p>
