								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3 style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>Thank You V Shred Family: Celebrating 2-Million YouTube Subscribers With A Special Discount &amp; Brand New Workout!</strong></em></h3>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-7394" src="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/ezgif-5-dffd30744146.gif?resize=600%2C600&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="600" height="600" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>We are kind of at a loss for words.</p>
<p>If you had told us in 2015 when we first started our journey to change millions of lives through a health and fitness channel on YouTube  that we would reach<strong> 2-MILLION SUBSCRIBERS</strong> with over 450 million total views and counting in just 5 short years we probably wouldn’t have believed you.</p>
<p>We knew we had lofty goals and knew we would reach them one day, but honestly we thought the milestone we just reached was going to take much longer.</p>
<p>Yet, because of you here we are.</p>
<p>In only 5 years, we have created one of the world’s most popular fitness YouTube Channels and just recently hit <strong>2-Million Subscribers!</strong></p>
<p><!-- instagram error: invalid instagram resource --></p>
<p>It all started on March 2015… Four guys with a vision to simplify training and put the fun back in fitness.</p>
<p>Four guys that just wanted to show people that they can transform their body without endless hours in the gym and rabbit food diets.</p>
<p>Four guys that wanted to help people better their health and build self-confidence.</p>
<p>Now four people wanting to change lives has grown to a family of 2-MILLION from all over the world, and that is on YouTube alone.</p>
<p>We also have millions of social media followers, hundreds-of-thousands of custom training clients in 120+ countries, and have seen more people than we can count transform their bodies using our free YouTube workouts, free body-type quiz, and digital fitness programs.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://sculptnation.com/products"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-7402" src="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/ezgif-5-7c9e6c85e2b3.gif?resize=600%2C600&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="600" height="600" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>Second .. I know our YouTube subscribers have been waiting on some new workout videos to hit the channel.</p>
<p>We have been working hard behind the scenes putting all that together and have a ton of content we are anxious to post.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>We are kicking that off today with a BRAND NEW free workout for you guys!</strong></em></p>
<p>This is a FULL BODY WORKOUT that only takes 10 minutes of your day and can be done with ZERO EQUIPMENT!</p>
<p>While you are sweating along with us, if you haven’t already make sure and hit the subscribe button on the channel and share this blog with a friend or two so we can continue to grow this amazing community.</p>
<p>We aren’t done yet! 3-Million … we are coming for you!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>HERE IS HOW THIS TEN-MINUTE FAT HOME WORKOUT IS GONNA GO DOWN!</strong></p>
<p>You can adapt this workout to YOUR fitness level!</p>
<p>The faster you go, the more rounds you will be able to complete in the set 10 minutes.</p>
<p>The heavier the DBs you use, or the greater the resistance of the bands, the harder the workout will be!</p>
<p>Or you can skip out on any equipment and only use your body weight!</p>
<p>Set a timer for 10 Minutes and repeat this 10 move circuit as many times as possible without resting! <strong>Let’s Go!</strong></p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='1170' height='659' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/BtO8xt9z6PE?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>10 Min AT HOME Full Body Workout</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Goblet Squat w/shoulder press &#8211; 10 reps</li>
<li>Reverse Lunges w/bicep curl &#8211; 10 reps each side</li>
<li>Lateral Squats w/tricep kickback &#8211; 10 reps each side &#8211; 1 tricep kickback between sides</li>
<li>3-way-raise (lateral-to front-to upright) &#8211; 10 reps (one rep is all three)</li>
<li>Push-Ups &#8211; to shoulder taps &#8211; 10 reps (one rep is after push up, and shoulder tap each arm)</li>
<li>Glute Bridge &#8211; 10 reps followed by ISO hold</li>
<li>Superman Pulses &#8211; 30 seconds &#8211; followed by ISO hold</li>
<li>Glute Kick-Ups to fire hydrant &#8211; 10 reps of each movement &#8211; each side</li>
<li>Mountain Climbers &#8211; 30 seconds</li>
<li>Plank &#8211; 30 seconds</li>
</ul>
<p>You will keep repeating this with NO REST until your TEN MINUTE TIMER IS UP! This 10 min workout will burn even more calories if you use dumbbells or resistance bands. You don’t always need fancy gym equipment or a large wide open space to get in a killer sweat session!</p>
<p>This workout is only 10 minutes so make sure you PUSH YOURSELF!! You can make an excuse, or you can MAKE time!</p>
<p>ONE MORE IMPORTANT THING….<br />
While this workout is great to throw in when you are “in a pinch” and will no doubt make anyone work up a sweat and blast some major calories, when it comes to achieving optimal results, you need a long term plan that you can adhere to more days than not.</p>
<p>It needs to factor in your personal starting point, your end goal, and, most importantly, your body type.</p>
<p>We have a <a href="https://vshred.com/sp/survey/survey-aka1/">FREE BODY TYPE QUIZ</a> that you can take that will take all the guesswork out and show you exactly how you should train and eat to fuel YOUR body!</p>
<p>We know if you are reading this you are probably already strapped for time.<br />
Don’t worry! <a href="https://vshred.com/sp/survey/survey-aka1/">The FREE BODY TYPE QUIZ</a> is only FIVE QUESTIONS.</p>
<p>Once you complete it, you will finally have the mystery taken out of how you should train and eat! So think of this quiz as only a few moments of your day that will give you back hours of time and stress later down the road!</p>
<p>DON’T FORGET ABOUT OUR SPECIAL THANK YOU &#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>We are giving you 30% off your Sculpt Nation order with codE: 2MILL30</strong><br />
<strong>So go stock up on all your favorites before the code expires! <a href="https://sculptnation.com/products">CLICK HERE TO SHOP!</a></strong></p>
