								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the least likely times, amidst the COVID-19 quarantine, Shady found a lifeline she didn’t even realize she needed. Our V Shred community helped her go from over 250 pounds and unable to play with her kids to an energetic 40-year old that is now on a mission to inspire others. We hope Shady’s V Shred transformation gives you some motivation today!</p>

<h2>Looking For Something More &#8211; Getting Started with V Shred</h2>
<p>Shady is a single mom of two young children that hustles hard, working two jobs to provide for her family.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s hard to believe that this now bubbly and confident 40-year old was almost 70 pounds heavier and battling depression.</p>
<p>At the beginning of 2020, Shady was 252 pounds and in denial.</p>
<blockquote><p>“I felt healthy, but then things started going downhill. My joints were sore, I was having a hard time walking. I couldn&#8217;t go bike riding with the kids. I became lazy and depressed.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Those feelings easily became amplified when COVID-19 hit. After all, she lost her side job in retail, her housecleaning business suffered, and she found herself isolated at home alone with her 2 kids.</p>
<p>But instead of spiraling downward, Shady decided to use her free time to self-reflect. She admitted she had let herself go and took the first step in regaining her health.</p>
<blockquote><p>“I started slowly by walking outside. That gave me the jumpstart. I started to feel better, but I was looking for something more hardcore.”</p></blockquote>
<p>It just so happens that a V Shred ad popped up on Shady’s Facebook page.</p>
<p>She began scrolling and reading transformation stories of women just like her. She instantly knew the V Shred community was exactly the push she needed. She was ready for her own V Shred transformation!</p>
<blockquote><p>“Before I even started day one, I was on the community page, reading these women’s posts of inspiration, and love, and encouragement. It was average women that showed before and afters. Just reading how supportive everybody was, that was a huge part of it for me.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Without hesitation, she downloaded the V Shred app and purchased the <a href="https://vshred.com/sp/fat-loss-extreme-f/sku_CKcwR4TEg54IeG?utm_source=blog-shady&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=female-motivation-testimonial&amp;utm_content=FLE-zee.j&amp;utm_term=5">Fat Loss Extreme program</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>“It kicked my butt! I even felt better after just one day.”</p></blockquote>
<h2>Community Helped Shady&#8217;s V Shred Transformation Mean Something More</h2>
<p>Working out wasn’t unfamiliar territory for Shady. At one time, she was a fitness instructor! It was the dieting part that was foreign. But thanks to the free information in the V Shred app and pointers from thousands of new friends, Shady taught herself how to track macros and eat clean.</p>
<blockquote><p>“I didn’t realize that diet was 80% of it. All the information that you get with the app, it&#8217;s just so helpful and really insightful. It&#8217;s easy to follow and such a good program.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Before long, Shady was no longer reading other women&#8217;s success stories. She had the confidence to post her own inspiring before and after pictures.</p>
<blockquote><p>“It is absolute sister love, it truly is. It&#8217;s like you have connections with these people from all over the world. It&#8217;s incredible.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Shady’s new love for health and fitness also led her to set an example for her two young kids.</p>
<blockquote><p>“My son was only eating Kraft dinners, hot dogs, and garbage food. I was like, you know what guys, you&#8217;re 9 and 10, I want you guys to be healthy for life and not do it as late as I did. We literally went through the entire house and donated everything that we could that was not nutritional.”</p></blockquote>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-7650" src="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/shady-healthy-lifestyle-family.png?resize=1024%2C390&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="390" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/shady-healthy-lifestyle-family.png?resize=1024%2C390&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/shady-healthy-lifestyle-family.png?resize=300%2C114&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/shady-healthy-lifestyle-family.png?resize=768%2C292&amp;ssl=1 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Every day wasn’t easy. There were moments when Shady wanted to quit.</p>
<blockquote><p>“You have those days you just want to stay into the covers and close the blinds and shut everyone out. But then the kids would come into my room and say, mom, let&#8217;s go for a walk!”</p></blockquote>
<p>In just over 3 months, with no gym, only her V Shred app and online community, Shady lost almost 70 pounds! Her physical V Shred transformation even gave her the confidence to join a burlesque dance group and wear a sexy new dress to celebrate turning 40 years young!</p>

I would post pictures on Facebook, and people would ask, what are you doing? Of course, I told them about the <a href="https://vshred.com/sp/fat-loss-extreme-f/sku_CKcwR4TEg54IeG?utm_source=blog-shady&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=female-motivation-testimonial&amp;utm_content=FLE-zee.j&amp;utm_term=5">V Shred program</a>. ”</p></blockquote>
<h2>Setting Her Sights Forward With Everyone She Loves</h2>
<p>Shady now weighs a more healthy 185 pounds and is setting her focus on building lean muscle by incorporating Sculpt Nation supplements and starting the V Shred <a href="https://vshred.com/sp/toned-in-90-days/v1/?utm_source=blog-shady&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=female-motivation-testimonial&amp;utm_content=FLE-zee.j&amp;utm_term=5">Toned In 90 Days</a> and <a href="https://vshred.com/sp/the-booty-builder/v1/?utm_source=blog-shady&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=female-motivation-testimonial&amp;utm_content=FLE-zee.j&amp;utm_term=5">BootyBuilder</a> programs.</p>
<p>Shady is excited to see just how far new love for fitness can take her, but more than a better body, she just wants her journey to continue to inspire and motivate others to start or continue their own V Shred transformation.</p>
<blockquote><p>“The fact that I&#8217;ve inspired people and it&#8217;s really crazy. It gives me goosebumps. My friends are just like, what are you doing? I want to feel the way you feel. I want to continue to give that to people and inspire people and make them feel good. That&#8217;s all I want.”</p></blockquote>

<p>When exercise becomes a convenient habit, transformations become possible. In August 2019, Deborah, 40, of Inez, TX came back to work after a week off due to nerve damage in her back. The other waitresses in the restaurant where she worked had started a small weight loss challenge. The winner amongst them would get the prize pool from each person’s $5 buy in plus a gift card for matching that total. It wasn’t much, but Deborah figured what the heck…and now her V Shred transformation is inspiring others!</p>
<p><em>“I put money in and signed up, but I was convinced I wouldn’t lose weight so I just kept doing what I normally did.”</em> she explained.</p>
<p>After a couple weeks, as some of the other waitresses started to lose a few initial pounds Deborah saw a photo of herself and did not like what was looking back at her.</p>
<p><em>“Man was it an eye opener.”</em></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-7636" src="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Deb-before-blog.png?resize=1024%2C1024&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="1024" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Deb-before-blog.png?resize=1024%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Deb-before-blog.png?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 150w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Deb-before-blog.png?resize=300%2C300&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Deb-before-blog.png?resize=768%2C768&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Deb-before-blog.png?resize=60%2C60&amp;ssl=1 60w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Deb-before-blog.png?w=1080&amp;ssl=1 1080w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>The very next day she signed up for a gym membership with a friend. As they both consistently went to the gym after dropping the kids off at school at eating healthier, she started to notice results.</p>
<p><em>“Within a month I lost 9 pounds! With the busy schedules of kids and work I didn’t want to be stressed about work outs and food.”</em></p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Finding Fat Loss Extreme for Women &#8211; Starting A V Shred Transformation</h2>
<p>It was a good start, but as a busy working mother of 3, Deborah knew she needed something more straightforward and structured.</p>
<p><em>“I needed someone to tell me what workouts to do on what days, how many reps, when to rest, and FOR SURE what to eat. Counting macros was not in the cards for me and didn’t have to be. With V Shred its all done for me and works. I love all of it!!”</em> she described, looking back on her V Shred transformation.</p>
<p>Deborah first got started with the <a href="https://vshred.com/sp/fat-loss-extreme-f/sku_CKcwR4TEg54IeG?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=socialmedia&amp;utm_campaign=female-motivation-testimonial&amp;utm_content=Product-Author&amp;utm_term=5">Fat Loss Extreme for Her</a> program. Once she completed the initial 90 days she switched to the <a href="https://vshred.com/sp/ripped-in-90-days/sku_AR6nTj3PTK3uu9?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=socialmedia&amp;utm_campaign=female-motivation-testimonial&amp;utm_content=Product-Author&amp;utm_term=5">Ripped In 90 Days</a> program, and now does a regular combination of the two.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-7629" src="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/before-after-f-sc-225.jpg?resize=1024%2C1024&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="1024" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/before-after-f-sc-225.jpg?resize=1024%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/before-after-f-sc-225.jpg?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 150w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/before-after-f-sc-225.jpg?resize=300%2C300&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/before-after-f-sc-225.jpg?resize=768%2C768&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/before-after-f-sc-225.jpg?resize=60%2C60&amp;ssl=1 60w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/before-after-f-sc-225.jpg?w=1080&amp;ssl=1 1080w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><em>“I was never involved in working out or eating healthy ever.”</em> Deborah explained. <em>“After starting V Shred my body was constantly changing for the better and I now see muscles I didn’t know I had! I keep going then pushing harder.”</em></p>
<p>Throughout 2020 Deborah was able to continue her exercises at the gym, despite COVID closures in other parts of Texas. Her success inspired her to close in a patio at home, and like many, create her own home gym.</p>
<p><em>“It has everything I need except a stair stepper and a couple of leg machines.”</em></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-7630" src="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/ezgif-2-f58715b67360.gif?resize=1080%2C410&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1080" height="410" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><em>“With the home gym and all of V Shred’s programs, I have plenty to do. I also purchased <a href="https://vshred.com/sp/move?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=socialmedia&amp;utm_campaign=female-motivation-testimonial&amp;utm_content=Product-Author&amp;utm_term=5">V Shred&#8217;s MOVE Program</a> during quarantine! As far as nutrition, I kept making my meal plans [with my V Shred Trainer] and sticking with the diet. We have a garden to grow our own vegetables, have 10 chickens for fresh eggs, and a pond stocked with catfish and perch which are just now getting big enough to eat.”</em></p>
<p>Once her weight loss results were noticeable from diet and exercise alone Deborah started implementing SculptNation supplements to gain that extra edge on her already active day to day life.</p>
<p><em>“When Sculpt Nation has their <a href="https://sculptnation.com/products/fat-loss-stack?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=socialmedia&amp;utm_campaign=female-motivation-testimonial&amp;utm_content=Product-Author&amp;utm_term=5">40% off sales</a> I stock up 3-6 months in advance… My closet is kind of like a supplement store.”</em> Deborah mused.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">A True V Shred Transformation &#8211; From Tired &amp; Injured to Proud &amp; Self-Sufficient</h2>
<p>From the support Deborah received from family and friends, she also had a bit of a wakeup call. Well past the initial challenge with coworkers, others were noticing her body composition change, her improved attitude, and her enthusiasm for helping others. As people started asking her questions, she knew helping others transform into happy and proud versions of themselves (like she had) was something she wanted to do.</p>
<p><em>“My mom saw my weight loss and started training with me. She got down 30 pounds in 3 months! My 4 year old wants to eat what I eat so he can have muscles. My 13 year old loves going to the gym with me. My husband constantly tells me how proud of me he is. They’ve all supported me 100%!”</em></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-7633" src="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Deb-progress2.png?resize=1024%2C1024&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="1024" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Deb-progress2.png?resize=1024%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Deb-progress2.png?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 150w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Deb-progress2.png?resize=300%2C300&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Deb-progress2.png?resize=768%2C768&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Deb-progress2.png?resize=60%2C60&amp;ssl=1 60w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>Now Deborah is returning the favor!</p>
<p><em>“Now that I have been on this journey I know that I absolutely want to help people to hit their personal goals and feel happy and proud of themselves inside and out.”</em></p>
<p>Deborah has enrolled in the ACE personal training certification program. At age 40 with new goals and dreams she’s working to become certified as a trainer, nutritionist, and youth fitness coach to help kids get on the right track early, as she now has been able to help her family do.</p>
<p>This fall Deborah competed in an online competition to be featured on <a href="https://mshealthandfitness.com/2020/deborah-mcdaniel?utm_source=vshred-blog&amp;utm_medium=socialmedia&amp;utm_campaign=female-motivation-testimonial&amp;utm_content=Product-Author&amp;utm_term=5">Ms Health And Fitness</a> and finished in the top 10!</p>
<h2>Giving Back Fitness Motivation</h2>
<p>When Deborah was asked about how community plays a part in a fitness journey and her personal V Shred transformation she mentioned her success was all about the support she received. Motivating loved ones, professional guidance, and a community of like minded individuals help make personal transformations possible.</p>
<p><em>“My experience with Vshred has been life changing. When it comes to my fitness journey I am proud that I stuck to it even when I didn’t want to. The Vshred for women Facebook page is amazing, all the support and transformation are awesome!”</em></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-7568" src="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/43707f0c562bc5957a2488cd1a9fd5322a9e2de0.jpg?resize=1024%2C768&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="768" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/43707f0c562bc5957a2488cd1a9fd5322a9e2de0.jpg?resize=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/43707f0c562bc5957a2488cd1a9fd5322a9e2de0.jpg?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/43707f0c562bc5957a2488cd1a9fd5322a9e2de0.jpg?resize=768%2C576&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/43707f0c562bc5957a2488cd1a9fd5322a9e2de0.jpg?w=1440&amp;ssl=1 1440w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><em>“I never even thought of going to the gym and eating healthy, but now want to help others do it. If V Shred wouldn’t have been such an amazing program I probably would have stopped a long time ago!”</em></p>
<p>The V Shred Team is so proud of Deborah’s journey and cannot wait to see her help others build active and healthy lifestyles. Her’s is a unique, and lifelong journey. Shred on!</p>

<p>If you have a lot of weight to lose, or if you are just trying to lose that last layer of fat covering your mid-section, THIS <em><strong><a href="https://sculptnation.com/products/fat-loss-stack" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FAT LOSS STACK</a> could help!</strong></em></p>
<p>Now, of course, you can’t just take some supplements and do this short ab workout we are about to show you, and expect to be shredded.</p>
<p>You have to exercise and follow a nutrition plan that is best for your body type. If you aren’t sure what yours is .. check out this <strong><a href="https://vshred.com/sp/survey/survey-aka1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FREE QUIZ</a></strong>! It will tell you what your body type is and give you 3 most important things you need to do to get in shape based on the way YOU are built!</p>
<p>If you have put off getting in shape for summer, you may be tempted to set unrealistic goals or turn to some silly quick-fix detox diet… <em><strong>don’t do that!</strong></em></p>
<p>First of all, there is no such thing. Second, no matter what your short-term goals are, your focus should always be on long-term success.</p>
<p>Training and eating for <a href="https://vshred.com/sp/survey/survey-aka1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">your body type</a> will always be the best way to achieve that!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>Now that we’ve covered the most important bases to help you reveal that summer six-pack… let’s get to BUILDING your abs … with this killer core workout!</strong></em></p>

<p>Since the sun is finally shining brighter and temperatures are rising a bit, we want to encourage you to<em><strong> take some of your workouts OUTDOORS!</strong></em></p>
<p>Lack of motivation is one of the biggest reasons people skip training. There&#8217;s nothing quite like surrounding yourself with nature and breathing in some fresh air. It is the perfect motivator to get you moving!</p>
<p>Being outdoors helps lower stress, clears your mind, improves happiness, and according to some studies, can even up your calorie burn a little bit!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>Put on some SPF, pound some <a href="https://sculptnation.com/products/pre-workout" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pre-workout</a> to help you push through, </strong></em><br />
<em><strong>head outside to a nice even spot in the grass, and follow along for this</strong></em><br />
<em><strong>5 Exercise Ab Workout .. that will leave your core on fire!</strong></em></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>The Future Of Fat Loss Revealed (It sounds too good to be true)</strong></em></p>
<p><img class="size-large wp-image-7388" src="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_183074918.jpeg?resize=1024%2C567&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="567" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_183074918.jpeg?resize=1024%2C567&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_183074918.jpeg?resize=300%2C166&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_183074918.jpeg?resize=768%2C425&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_183074918.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_183074918.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>If there was a magic pill that allowed you to not exercise, eat what you want, and never gain an ounce of fat… everyone would be walking around with a six-pack and a slice of pizza.</p>
<p>There is no such thing.</p>
<p>But if some of the top researchers in the world are correct .. <em><strong>there may be a BIOLOGICAL “LOOPHOLE”</strong></em> … that helps support the speed of the metabolism (which dictates how much fat you can lose.)</p>
<p>It’s so effective… <em><strong>they are calling it “THE FUTURE OF FAT LOSS”!!</strong></em></p>
<p>This IS going to sound too good to be true.<br />
This IS going to sound like a bunch of hype.</p>
<p>Because this loophole is NOT a diet plan, a workout video, or anything else you may think of when it comes to burning fat.</p>
<p>We had a hard time believing it too.</p>
<p>But the science on this one is pretty clear.<br />
<em><strong>This discovery is all about how your body, and your fat cells, communicate.</strong></em></p>
<p>Once you change this communication process, it seems that it is possible to <em><strong>force your body to support burning it’s deepest fat stores</strong></em>. You know, the ones that seem immune to hardcore workouts and ultra-strict diets.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>It can all happen because of something called … Simultaneous Fat Release.</strong></em></p>

<p>How do you promote the activation of your body’s “simultaneous fat release” capabilities?<br />
We are about to tell you!!</p>
<p>It’s crazy!! But once you know how to change the conversation that’s happening between your fat cells… you can finally help alter the way your body burns fat ..rapidly!</p>
<p><em><strong>For real! This hack only takes about 30 seconds to add to your day!!</strong></em></p>
<p>Before we tell you what scientists say the solution is .. let’s go back to the first discovery researchers made .. so that we can better understand why all this happens to begin with.</p>
<p><strong>FAT CELL SIGNALING</strong><br />
Researchers found that our fat cells talk to each other. It’s called Fat Cell Signaling.</p>
<p>Fat cells are not merely big blobs that sit in silence. They are rather chatty and not only talk to each other, but to other cells in your body.</p>
<p>Right now, as you read this, your fat cells are deciding whether or not they are going to put your body into fat-burning mode or fat-storing mode.</p>
<p>If you <span style="text-decoration: underline;">NEVER</span> struggle with your weight… congrats! That means your fat cells are probably having a nice chat.</p>
<p>However, if you feel like you struggle to lose weight, those same 10 pounds keep coming back, most diets fail, or you can’t seem to get rid of “stubborn” areas of fat .. your fat cells are most likely having a conversation you don’t want them to have.</p>
<p>Most of us fall into that second category because our bodies were designed to store fat.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>Chances are the conversation your cells are having over-and-over again ..</strong></em><br />
<em><strong>is to HOLD ON to fat .. not burn it.</strong></em></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-7130" src="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_209544099.jpeg?resize=1170%2C780&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1170" height="780" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_209544099.jpeg?w=5910&amp;ssl=1 5910w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_209544099.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_209544099.jpeg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_209544099.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_209544099.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_209544099.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1170px) 100vw, 1170px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>This means you can do all the cardio in the world and eat an overly restrictive diet but still be holding on to a stubborn layer of fat!</p>
<p>Of course, how much body fat you have will depend on lots of factors (diet, exercise, stress, sleep, genetics, etc.) But your fat cells ultimately make this decision through that constant communication (fat cell signaling).</p>
<p>This new research also explains why some of the most popular American diets don’t work long term. Sorry “keto” and “low-fat” .. science says your restrictive diets DO NOT have the ability to change the way your fat cells communicate.</p>
<p>However, scientists discovered a receptor in your body that CAN help alter this communication process. Once “activated”, it can help complement any “diet” and exercise program you choose.<br />
It’s called the TRPV1 Receptor.</p>
<p><strong>WHAT IS THE TRPV1 RECEPTOR</strong><br />
A professor of neurosurgery, biological chemistry, and neuroscience at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine was the first to discover this receptor.</p>
<p>You have TRPV1 Receptors throughout your entire body. Their main job is to regulate your body’s temperature and energy usage. It kicks in when your body temperature increases.</p>
<p>For example, when you are doing cardio or working out. TRPV1 senses this temperature spike and tells your fat cells to start burning their contents for energy.</p>
<p><strong>WHAT HAPPENS WHEN TRPV1 RECEPTORS ARE ACTIVATED (“Simultaneous Fat Release”)</strong><br />
Now it’s time to tell you about that “loophole” we mentioned.</p>
<p>Scientists discovered that when these receptors are activated, they help tell your fat cells to start communicating differently. They tell them to burn themselves for energy, instead of holding on and storing in places like your stomach and thighs.</p>
<p>This is important….<br />
It means that TRPV1 can actually alter the conversation that’s happening between your fat cells. In fact, they found <em><strong>when you activate TRPV1 Receptors, you can support fat burning virtually EVERYWHERE .</strong></em></p>
<p>The ability to burn fat EVERYWHERE all at once is called “Simultaneous Fat Release.”</p>
<p>This process can force your body to support burning the fat you already have (even your deepest fat stores)..</p>
<p><em><strong>Simultaneous Fat Release can fundamentally transform your body’s relationship with fat…</strong></em> because once you activate your body’s “simultaneous fat release” capabilities.. you can stay in fat-burning support mode virtually all day …burning unhealthy fat build-up EVERYWHERE in your body.</p>
<p><strong>HOW TO ACTIVATE TRPV1 RECEPTORS (simultaneous fat release)</strong></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-7131" src="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_342916350.jpeg?resize=1170%2C771&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1170" height="771" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_342916350.jpeg?w=4802&amp;ssl=1 4802w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_342916350.jpeg?resize=300%2C198&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_342916350.jpeg?resize=768%2C506&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_342916350.jpeg?resize=1024%2C675&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_342916350.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_342916350.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1170px) 100vw, 1170px" data-recalc-dims="1" /><br />
As mentioned, one way to activate the TRPV1 Receptors is through super-intense workouts.<br />
But scientists have found that we can also activate our TRV1 Receptors another way.</p>
<p>They discovered that these receptors can also be activated by eating a common spice found in red chili peppers. It’s called Capsaicin.</p>
<p>Over the years, NUMEROUS studies have been done on the effectiveness of Capsaicin.</p>
<p><em><strong>Here are the findings of only A FEW ….</strong></em></p>
<ul>
<li>“Capsaicin was found to enhance energy expenditure and fat burning in humans, particularly those with a high Body Mass Index (BMI.)”</li>
<li>“Participants in the Capsaicin group saw a significant decrease in stomach fat when used as part of a weight management program.”</li>
<li>“The Capsaicin group lost nearly double the weight of the placebo group.”</li>
<li>“The Capsaicin group increased their body’s fat-burning potential by up to 46.4% when used daily for 8 weeks, while the placebo group saw no improvement at all.”</li>
<li>“Capsaicin activates TRPV1 Receptors and significantly increases metabolism and fat burning potential.”</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>OF COURSE, it’s not as easy as eating some red chili peppers!!</strong></em></p>
<p>All of the studies mentioned used a Capsaicin supplement. That is because the amount of chili peppers needed to activate your TRPV1 receptors is very high. It would make you physically sick if you attempted to EAT that many chili peppers (don&#8217;t do that.)</p>
<p>With a supplement, you can safely consume Capsaicin at a much higher quantity.</p>
<p>BEFORE YOU EXIT THIS ARTICLE and attempt to “google” Capsaicin ..<em><strong> there is something very important you need to know about this spice.</strong></em></p>
<p>The supplement form of Capsaicin isn’t hard to find. However, it can vary dramatically both in quality and effectiveness.</p>
<p>You have to ensure that the Capsaicin you choose is time-released and has a special coating.</p>
<p>For that reason, there’s only one form of Capsaicin that we stand behind. <em><strong>This specific formula of Capsaicin has already helped over 1.2 Million people (and counting) finally lose fat and help keep it off when combined with diet and exercise!</strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>THIS FORM OF CAPSAICIN is in high demand &#8211; but very limited supply.</strong></em></p>
<p>Only a select group of supplement manufacturers can get access to this specific form of Capsaicin.</p>
<p>Whether you are making progress but can’t seem to blast that last bit of fat, or are just getting started and have a long way to go, you can provide support to help SPEED UP fat loss once you tell your fat cells how to communicate with each other!</p>

<p>What if someone told you the reason you haven’t seen results, no matter what diet or training plan you follow, isn&#8217;t your fault?</p>
<p>What if there was a “biological hack” that could finally allow you to unleash and promote your full fat-blasting potential?</p>
<p>If researchers from places like Cambridge and Harvard are correct … there is!!</p>
<p><em><strong>The struggle is real&#8230;</strong></em><br />
Trying to re-shape your body by building lean muscle and losing body fat takes time and consistency.</p>
<p><em><strong>We all know that there is not a quick way to go about this.</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>But for some…</strong></em><br />
It doesn’t matter how hard they push, how many hours of cardio they log, or how many calories they restrict &#8211; the changes just don’t seem to happen. Or if they do &#8211; they are painfully slow.</p>
<p><em><strong>If this is you or someone you know…</strong></em> the information in this article could be life-changing!</p>
<p>Some of the top researchers from around the world wanted to find out why some people can’t lose weight no matter what or how hard they try.</p>
<p><em><strong>They made A MAJOR FAT BURNING DISCOVERY!!</strong></em></p>
<p>What we are sharing with you is something even those that don’t struggle with weight issues need to know because&#8230; <em><strong>the culprit is something we all have circulating through our bodies… waiting to attack our fat cells.</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>The reason every diet you have ever tried has failed could be something </strong></em><em><strong>in YOUR BLOOD.</strong></em></p>

<p>We are NOT talking about genetics.</p>
<p>The genes your parents gave you and your body type aren’t all that matter.<br />
Anyone can have too much of this circulating through their blood.</p>
<p><em><strong>The blame could be because of excess protein.</strong></em></p>
<p>Not the kind you eat. This is a protein that is flowing throughout your body right now even as you read this article, and<em><strong> its job is to BLOCK YOU FROM LOSING WEIGHT!</strong></em></p>
<p>No matter what type of lifestyle change you make&#8230; if you have too much of this protein in your blood&#8230; you could still struggle to lose fat.</p>
<p><em><strong>WHAT IS THIS FAT BLOCKING PROTEIN?!</strong></em><br />
It has a scientific name, but we are just going to call it <strong>THE FAT PROTEIN</strong> &#8211; because that is exactly what it does.<em><strong> It slows down your metabolism and sabotages your efforts to lose weight.</strong></em></p>
<p>These proteins attach themselves to your fat cells and virtually force your body to hold on to fat for dear life! They stop your metabolism from generating the kind of heat it needs to burn fat.</p>
<p>Scientists discovered that people that are overweight have MORE of this protein in their bloodstream.</p>
<p>But why? And what can you do about it?<br />

<p>Hold up .. we aren’t talking about the kind of body fat you want to get rid of.<br />
We also aren’t referring to “healthy fats” you should eat.</p>
<p>You have TWO types of FAT CELLS in your body, and both play a role in your metabolism.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>White Fat</strong>: This is bad fat. It is responsible for storing excess fat to be later used for energy.</li>
<li><strong>Brown Fat</strong>: This is good fat. It creates heat in your body and revs up your fat-burning metabolism.</li>
</ul>
<p>Researchers found that this fat protein is only made by your WHITE (bad) fat cells.</p>
<p>If this is true, then logic would tell us that you can help tackle this by making LESS white fat and MORE brown fat, right?</p>
<p>How in the world can you do that? Is it even possible? YES!!</p>
<p><em><strong>HOW TO SUPPORT MAKING MORE METABOLISM BOOSTING BROWN FAT&#8230;</strong></em><br />
There are THREE things that researchers have found to help increase the amount of BROWN (good) fat cells that you have.</p>
<p>Unless you like being cold and hungry, you aren’t going to like the first two… they are extreme.</p>
<p>The third method is fast and easy. Researchers found that you can help support and restart your fat-loss engine <em><strong>with a single nutrient.</strong></em></p>
<p>There is an herb that has the potential to promote the conversion of unhealthy white fat cells into fat-burning, thermogenic, brown fat cells.</p>

<p><em><strong>WHAT IS THIS SUPER NUTRIENT THAT INCREASES FAT BLASTING BROWN FAT??</strong></em><br />
It is an ancient herb that very well may be the most effective nutritional supplement in existence. You can purchase it almost anywhere, and it is pretty inexpensive.</p>
<p>Not only is it said to increase the production of brown fat .. this power-house herb has been shown to ….</p>
<ul>
<li>Balance Mood</li>
<li>Support a Healthy Inflammatory Response</li>
<li>Support Carbohydrate Metabolism</li>
<li>Ease Temporary, Activity Related Joint Pain/Stiffness</li>
<li>Support A Healthy Metabolism</li>
<li>Decrease Muscle Soreness</li>
</ul>
<p><em><strong>There is only one problem…</strong></em><br />
