<p>When exercise becomes a convenient habit, transformations become possible. In August 2019, Deborah, 40, of Inez, TX came back to work after a week off due to nerve damage in her back. The other waitresses in the restaurant where she worked had started a small weight loss challenge. The winner amongst them would get the prize pool from each person’s $5 buy in plus a gift card for matching that total. It wasn’t much, but Deborah figured what the heck…and now her V Shred transformation is inspiring others!</p>
<p><em>“I put money in and signed up, but I was convinced I wouldn’t lose weight so I just kept doing what I normally did.”</em> she explained.</p>
<p>After a couple weeks, as some of the other waitresses started to lose a few initial pounds Deborah saw a photo of herself and did not like what was looking back at her.</p>
<p><em>“Man was it an eye opener.”</em></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-7636" src="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Deb-before-blog.png?resize=1024%2C1024&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="1024" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Deb-before-blog.png?resize=1024%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Deb-before-blog.png?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 150w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Deb-before-blog.png?resize=300%2C300&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Deb-before-blog.png?resize=768%2C768&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Deb-before-blog.png?resize=60%2C60&amp;ssl=1 60w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Deb-before-blog.png?w=1080&amp;ssl=1 1080w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>The very next day she signed up for a gym membership with a friend. As they both consistently went to the gym after dropping the kids off at school at eating healthier, she started to notice results.</p>
<p><em>“Within a month I lost 9 pounds! With the busy schedules of kids and work I didn’t want to be stressed about work outs and food.”</em></p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Finding Fat Loss Extreme for Women &#8211; Starting A V Shred Transformation</h2>
<p>It was a good start, but as a busy working mother of 3, Deborah knew she needed something more straightforward and structured.</p>
<p><em>“I needed someone to tell me what workouts to do on what days, how many reps, when to rest, and FOR SURE what to eat. Counting macros was not in the cards for me and didn’t have to be. With V Shred its all done for me and works. I love all of it!!”</em> she described, looking back on her V Shred transformation.</p>
<p>Deborah first got started with the <a href="https://vshred.com/sp/fat-loss-extreme-f/sku_CKcwR4TEg54IeG?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=socialmedia&amp;utm_campaign=female-motivation-testimonial&amp;utm_content=Product-Author&amp;utm_term=5">Fat Loss Extreme for Her</a> program. Once she completed the initial 90 days she switched to the <a href="https://vshred.com/sp/ripped-in-90-days/sku_AR6nTj3PTK3uu9?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=socialmedia&amp;utm_campaign=female-motivation-testimonial&amp;utm_content=Product-Author&amp;utm_term=5">Ripped In 90 Days</a> program, and now does a regular combination of the two.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-7629" src="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/before-after-f-sc-225.jpg?resize=1024%2C1024&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="1024" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/before-after-f-sc-225.jpg?resize=1024%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/before-after-f-sc-225.jpg?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 150w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/before-after-f-sc-225.jpg?resize=300%2C300&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/before-after-f-sc-225.jpg?resize=768%2C768&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/before-after-f-sc-225.jpg?resize=60%2C60&amp;ssl=1 60w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/before-after-f-sc-225.jpg?w=1080&amp;ssl=1 1080w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><em>“I was never involved in working out or eating healthy ever.”</em> Deborah explained. <em>“After starting V Shred my body was constantly changing for the better and I now see muscles I didn’t know I had! I keep going then pushing harder.”</em></p>
<p>Throughout 2020 Deborah was able to continue her exercises at the gym, despite COVID closures in other parts of Texas. Her success inspired her to close in a patio at home, and like many, create her own home gym.</p>
<p><em>“It has everything I need except a stair stepper and a couple of leg machines.”</em></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-7630" src="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/ezgif-2-f58715b67360.gif?resize=1080%2C410&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1080" height="410" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><em>“With the home gym and all of V Shred’s programs, I have plenty to do. I also purchased <a href="https://vshred.com/sp/move?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=socialmedia&amp;utm_campaign=female-motivation-testimonial&amp;utm_content=Product-Author&amp;utm_term=5">V Shred&#8217;s MOVE Program</a> during quarantine! As far as nutrition, I kept making my meal plans [with my V Shred Trainer] and sticking with the diet. We have a garden to grow our own vegetables, have 10 chickens for fresh eggs, and a pond stocked with catfish and perch which are just now getting big enough to eat.”</em></p>
<p>Once her weight loss results were noticeable from diet and exercise alone Deborah started implementing SculptNation supplements to gain that extra edge on her already active day to day life.</p>
<p><em>“When Sculpt Nation has their <a href="https://sculptnation.com/products/fat-loss-stack?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=socialmedia&amp;utm_campaign=female-motivation-testimonial&amp;utm_content=Product-Author&amp;utm_term=5">40% off sales</a> I stock up 3-6 months in advance… My closet is kind of like a supplement store.”</em> Deborah mused.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-7631" src="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/117831867_592673508072569_7785970253332491242_n.jpg?resize=1024%2C768&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="768" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/117831867_592673508072569_7785970253332491242_n.jpg?resize=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/117831867_592673508072569_7785970253332491242_n.jpg?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/117831867_592673508072569_7785970253332491242_n.jpg?resize=768%2C576&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/117831867_592673508072569_7785970253332491242_n.jpg?w=1242&amp;ssl=1 1242w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">A True V Shred Transformation &#8211; From Tired &amp; Injured to Proud &amp; Self-Sufficient</h2>
<p>From the support Deborah received from family and friends, she also had a bit of a wakeup call. Well past the initial challenge with coworkers, others were noticing her body composition change, her improved attitude, and her enthusiasm for helping others. As people started asking her questions, she knew helping others transform into happy and proud versions of themselves (like she had) was something she wanted to do.</p>
<p><em>“My mom saw my weight loss and started training with me. She got down 30 pounds in 3 months! My 4 year old wants to eat what I eat so he can have muscles. My 13 year old loves going to the gym with me. My husband constantly tells me how proud of me he is. They’ve all supported me 100%!”</em></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-7633" src="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Deb-progress2.png?resize=1024%2C1024&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="1024" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Deb-progress2.png?resize=1024%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Deb-progress2.png?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 150w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Deb-progress2.png?resize=300%2C300&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Deb-progress2.png?resize=768%2C768&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Deb-progress2.png?resize=60%2C60&amp;ssl=1 60w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>Now Deborah is returning the favor!</p>
<p><em>“Now that I have been on this journey I know that I absolutely want to help people to hit their personal goals and feel happy and proud of themselves inside and out.”</em></p>
<p>Deborah has enrolled in the ACE personal training certification program. At age 40 with new goals and dreams she’s working to become certified as a trainer, nutritionist, and youth fitness coach to help kids get on the right track early, as she now has been able to help her family do.</p>
<p>This fall Deborah competed in an online competition to be featured on <a href="https://mshealthandfitness.com/2020/deborah-mcdaniel?utm_source=vshred-blog&amp;utm_medium=socialmedia&amp;utm_campaign=female-motivation-testimonial&amp;utm_content=Product-Author&amp;utm_term=5">Ms Health And Fitness</a> and finished in the top 10!</p>
<h2>Giving Back Fitness Motivation</h2>
<p>When Deborah was asked about how community plays a part in a fitness journey and her personal V Shred transformation she mentioned her success was all about the support she received. Motivating loved ones, professional guidance, and a community of like minded individuals help make personal transformations possible.</p>
<p><em>“My experience with Vshred has been life changing. When it comes to my fitness journey I am proud that I stuck to it even when I didn’t want to. The Vshred for women Facebook page is amazing, all the support and transformation are awesome!”</em></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-7568" src="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/43707f0c562bc5957a2488cd1a9fd5322a9e2de0.jpg?resize=1024%2C768&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="768" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/43707f0c562bc5957a2488cd1a9fd5322a9e2de0.jpg?resize=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/43707f0c562bc5957a2488cd1a9fd5322a9e2de0.jpg?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/43707f0c562bc5957a2488cd1a9fd5322a9e2de0.jpg?resize=768%2C576&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/43707f0c562bc5957a2488cd1a9fd5322a9e2de0.jpg?w=1440&amp;ssl=1 1440w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><em>“I never even thought of going to the gym and eating healthy, but now want to help others do it. If V Shred wouldn’t have been such an amazing program I probably would have stopped a long time ago!”</em></p>
<p>The V Shred Team is so proud of Deborah’s journey and cannot wait to see her help others build active and healthy lifestyles. Her’s is a unique, and lifelong journey. Shred on!</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3 style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>Thank You V Shred Family: Celebrating 2-Million YouTube Subscribers With A Special Discount &amp; Brand New Workout!</strong></em></h3>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-7394" src="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/ezgif-5-dffd30744146.gif?resize=600%2C600&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="600" height="600" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>We are kind of at a loss for words.</p>
<p>If you had told us in 2015 when we first started our journey to change millions of lives through a health and fitness channel on YouTube  that we would reach<strong> 2-MILLION SUBSCRIBERS</strong> with over 450 million total views and counting in just 5 short years we probably wouldn’t have believed you.</p>
<p>We knew we had lofty goals and knew we would reach them one day, but honestly we thought the milestone we just reached was going to take much longer.</p>
<p>Yet, because of you here we are.</p>
<p>In only 5 years, we have created one of the world’s most popular fitness YouTube Channels and just recently hit <strong>2-Million Subscribers!</strong></p>
<p><!-- instagram error: invalid instagram resource --></p>
<p>It all started on March 2015… Four guys with a vision to simplify training and put the fun back in fitness.</p>
<p>Four guys that just wanted to show people that they can transform their body without endless hours in the gym and rabbit food diets.</p>
<p>Four guys that wanted to help people better their health and build self-confidence.</p>

<p>Or you can skip out on any equipment and only use your body weight!</p>
<p>Set a timer for 10 Minutes and repeat this 10 move circuit as many times as possible without resting! <strong>Let’s Go!</strong></p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='1170' height='659' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/BtO8xt9z6PE?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>10 Min AT HOME Full Body Workout</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Goblet Squat w/shoulder press &#8211; 10 reps</li>
<li>Reverse Lunges w/bicep curl &#8211; 10 reps each side</li>
<li>Lateral Squats w/tricep kickback &#8211; 10 reps each side &#8211; 1 tricep kickback between sides</li>
<li>3-way-raise (lateral-to front-to upright) &#8211; 10 reps (one rep is all three)</li>

</ul>
<p>You will keep repeating this with NO REST until your TEN MINUTE TIMER IS UP! This 10 min workout will burn even more calories if you use dumbbells or resistance bands. You don’t always need fancy gym equipment or a large wide open space to get in a killer sweat session!</p>
<p>This workout is only 10 minutes so make sure you PUSH YOURSELF!! You can make an excuse, or you can MAKE time!</p>
<p>ONE MORE IMPORTANT THING….<br />
While this workout is great to throw in when you are “in a pinch” and will no doubt make anyone work up a sweat and blast some major calories, when it comes to achieving optimal results, you need a long term plan that you can adhere to more days than not.</p>
<p>It needs to factor in your personal starting point, your end goal, and, most importantly, your body type.</p>
<p>We have a <a href="https://vshred.com/sp/survey/survey-aka1/">FREE BODY TYPE QUIZ</a> that you can take that will take all the guesswork out and show you exactly how you should train and eat to fuel YOUR body!</p>
<p>We know if you are reading this you are probably already strapped for time.<br />
Don’t worry! <a href="https://vshred.com/sp/survey/survey-aka1/">The FREE BODY TYPE QUIZ</a> is only FIVE QUESTIONS.</p>
<p>Once you complete it, you will finally have the mystery taken out of how you should train and eat! So think of this quiz as only a few moments of your day that will give you back hours of time and stress later down the road!</p>
<p>DON’T FORGET ABOUT OUR SPECIAL THANK YOU &#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>We are giving you 30% off your Sculpt Nation order with codE: 2MILL30</strong><br />
<strong>So go stock up on all your favorites before the code expires! <a href="https://sculptnation.com/products">CLICK HERE TO SHOP!</a></strong></p>

<p>It is that time of year!! 4th of July is upon us!!</p>
<p>Burgers on the grill … fireworks in the sky … and for many .. an excuse to skip the gym and eat thousands of calories .. in one sitting!</p>
<p>It can be tempting to throw your diet and training mindset out the window when holidays come around. But you must treat holidays just like you would any other day.</p>
<p>Have fun .. enjoy the time with family … and even enjoy all the food .. but keep your goals in mind. One of the best things you can do .. is still get in a solid workout!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>We’ve got the perfect 4th of July PRE PARTY PUMP!</strong></em></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-7322" src="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_8006.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_8006.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_8006.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_8006.jpeg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_8006.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>The workout we&#8217;re giving you below will not only burn a ton of calories .. the endorphins released from this short HIIT workout will boost your mood .. which will help you keep your healthy food habits in mind when it’s time to fire up the grill!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>We will never tell you that you need to “earn” your calories .. that is not the kind of relationship with food we promote here at V Shred &amp; Sculpt Nation.</strong></em></p>
<p>Food should never be seen as “the enemy” or “a reward” .. and exercise should never be viewed as punishment.</p>
<p>Diet culture makes us feel bad about having a nice dinner with friends, and it makes us fall into the mind trap that holidays will make us gain weight.</p>
<p><em><strong>What happens next?</strong></em></p>
<p><img class="size-large wp-image-7158" src="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_215638387.jpeg?resize=1024%2C684&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="684" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_215638387.jpeg?resize=1024%2C684&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_215638387.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_215638387.jpeg?resize=768%2C513&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_215638387.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_215638387.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>We feel guilt .. and view exercise as “punishment” we “have” to get up and do the next day .. or as justification that if we burn a ton of calories pre-feast .. it’s okay to eat that extra serving of ice cream or calorie-filled cocktail.</p>
<p>Once you get this mentality, you will begin an endless (and very unhealthy) relationship with food. You will start to believe you ALWAYS have to earn food .. and will only feel okay about enjoying yourself .. if you have exercised.</p>
<p>Instead, look at your patriotic pump as a FREEDOM that you are blessed to have! You have an able body that GETS to move!!!</p>
<p>And view all that 4th of July food as FUEL! Getting in a workout before a big meal is a great way to rev up your metabolism and prepare your body to USE (instead of store) any extra calories you may consume!</p>
<p>Don’t fall into this food guilt trap<em>..</em>But also don’t go to the totally opposite end of the spectrum and make the holidays an excuse to be lazy and throw all your food mindfulness out the window! Use the short 15-minute workout  below and then ENJOY your day!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>Alright .. let’s get our PATRIOTIC PUMP ON!!</strong></em></p>
<p>Here is a quick fat blasting FOLLOW-ALONG cardio workout that won’t interfere with your day full of fun with friends and family!</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='1170' height='659' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/HzkBonK4kPQ?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The video above is a FOLLOW ALONG! Just press play and get to work! This fat-blasting workout consists of only 5 exercises. You will do each exercise for 40 seconds and take a quick 20-second break before moving on to the next exercise.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Explosive Squat with Calf Raises &#8211; 40 Seconds</strong><br />
<strong>Speed Skaters &#8211; 40 Seconds</strong><br />
<strong>High Knees &#8211; 40 Seconds</strong><br />
<strong>Alternating Toe Taps &#8211; 40 Seconds</strong><br />
<strong>Bicycles &#8211; 40 Seconds</strong></p>
<p>It only takes 15 minutes and can be done from home with NO EQUIPMENT! You don’t even need a mat or a timer! Since it’s a follow-along .. we’ve got everything taken care of for you!</p>
<p>Fill up your shaker with some <a href="https://sculptnation.com/products/pre-workout">Sculpt Nation PRE Workout</a> , and let’s get our Independence Day sweat on together… more calories burned means more BBQ to enjoy later, right?</p>

<p>Being a father is no doubt a blessing, but not always for your body. The demands of family life often mean a dad’s personal health becomes less of a priority.</p>
<p>Family duties aside, just being a man, in general, has a mound of pressures.</p>
<p>From the need to be successful, to the “act tough and hide weakness” mentality that guys are often taught.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>Society places a lot of responsibilities on men and data shows</strong></em><br />
<em><strong>you agree that it’s not good for you.</strong></em></p>
<p>A recent survey revealed that most men believe the pressures society places on them are unhealthy … with <em><strong>54% citing WEIGHT GAIN as their number one DAILY concern.</strong></em></p>
<p>Once you add “dad” to the list .. these pressures add up even more .. which usually results in putting health and fitness on the back burner.</p>
<p>Going to the gym and eating healthy falls to the bottom of the priority list.</p>
<p>So you shrug it off and embrace the “dad bod” look.</p>
<p>When the words dad bod went viral a few years ago (implying this was a physique women preferred) &#8211; guys worldwide celebrated!</p>
<p>But is this body type what women really prefer? Probably not.</p>
<p>Even more, is it a physique that makes YOU feel good? Also, not likely.</p>
<p>If you are confident with your expanding waistline .. that is great! You should love the skin you&#8217;re in ….</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>But you can’t ignore the health issues that come with having a dad bod physique.</strong></em></p>
<p><a href="https://sculptnation.com/products"><img class="size-full wp-image-7256" src="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_302233816.jpeg?resize=1170%2C781&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1170" height="781" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_302233816.jpeg?w=7360&amp;ssl=1 7360w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_302233816.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_302233816.jpeg?resize=768%2C513&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_302233816.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_302233816.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_302233816.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1170px) 100vw, 1170px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>The primary feature of a “dad bod” is an overall soft physique with very little muscle and a midsection that carries quite a bit of excess fat.</p>
<p>This type of belly fat is called Visceral Fat and can be very dangerous to your health.</p>
<p>Maybe your significant other tells you they like the extra cushion .. and perhaps you are totally fine with rocking a beer belly .. but it is important to keep in mind that storing a bit of extra fat around the midsection isn&#8217;t great for long term health.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>To be a good spouse and father .. you must take care of yourself.</strong></em></p>
<p>After all, you want to have the energy needed to respond to these pressures, right? Even more, I’m sure you want to enjoy life with your family!</p>
<p>Not to mention .. kids often mimic their parent’s behaviors. When a father figure is health-focused, it’s more likely the entire family will follow in his footsteps! By making your health a priority, you can be a fantastic role model in your home!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>There is no better time than Father’s Day ..</strong></em><br />
<em><strong>to remind yourself that YOU (and YOUR health) matters!</strong></em></p>
<p>To get rid of the fat that is a defining feature of dad bod .. you need to build muscle and drop body fat.</p>
<p>The best way to lose overall body fat is to focus on weight-training and throw in some high-intensity interval training cardio. It would help if you also established a lifestyle centered around proper nutrition.</p>
<p>Then you will want to focus on ab training at least a few days a week.</p>
<p>While you can’t “spot reduce” belly fat .. you must tone the muscles underneath so that once you start shedding pounds .. you will have a six-pack to reveal!</p>
<p>One of the best ways to train abs is through circuit training. It’s fast-paced .. which means your heart rate is more elevated. So, in addition to strengthening your core, circuits get you into a fat-burning zone.</p>
<p>I put together an <strong>8 MINUTE KILL YOUR DAD BOD AT HOME AB WORKOUT</strong> for all the busy dads out there. It only requires body weight and can be done from anywhere.</p>
<p>We aren’t suggesting you workout ON Father’s Day .. unless you want to. Relax! It’s your day!<br />
Hit the golf course, get outside and play with your kids, enjoy a big steak dinner, and save this killer 8 Minute Ab Workout for later!</p>

<p>I’m sure you often preach to the mom of your household that she needs to take care of herself.</p>
<p>You probably tell your kids that they need to eat their veggies, and you likely encourage them to participate in sports that keep them active and healthy .. but what about you?</p>
<p>Spend a little time this Father’s Day, reflecting on the ways you can take better care of yourself!</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>The Testosterone Suppression Response: What it is and how it’s holding you back</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>Close your eyes and imagine&#8230;</strong></em><br />
Having enough energy to power through your day with ease … laser focus and clarity to crush everyday tasks &#8230; seeing optimal results from weight training … ridding yourself of stubborn fat … having a robust sex life … being able to lay your head on your pillow and getting a quality, restful night of sleep.</p>
<p><em><strong>Sounds pretty dang good, doesn’t it?</strong> </em><br />
There are hundreds of chemical substances in your body that work in silence to ensure that all of this (plus more) can happen.</p>
<p><em><strong>We are talking about .. your hormones!</strong></em><br />
Hormones are messengers that tell your organs what they need to do and when.</p>
<p>Your hormones regulate everything… from how you think, feel, sleep, build muscle, store fat, breathe, and expend energy… to how hungry you are, your body temperature, sexual reproduction, libido, and much more.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>It doesn’t matter if you are 20 or 70 .. male or female ..</strong></em><br />
<em><strong>hormone levels can become “imbalanced” at any time &#8211; for many reasons.</strong></em></p>

<p>Even young and healthy individuals can experience hormone disruptions. This can come about from poor diet and lifestyle choices, and believe it or not, too much of a GOOD thing can also cause your hormones to go crazy! Excess exercise and diet can even be culprits!</p>
<p>Because your hormones quietly go to work&#8230;<em><strong> it’s not until something seems off that you would notice they aren’t functioning at top capacity.</strong></em></p>
<p>In this article, we want to discuss two hormones in particular and the shocking and potentially hazardous relationship they have with each other.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>NEW HORMONE RESEARCH SHOCKED US</strong><br />
Scientists have discovered a HIDDEN REASON why one of your KEY HORMONES could be low. And why even if you try to replenish it… your attempts could fail!</p>
<p>It’s something we had never heard before and are pretty sure you haven’t either.</p>
<p>Before we tell you about this strange connection and what you can do to help tackle root cause … we want to emphasize why <em><strong>this is something you should address immediately!</strong></em></p>
<p><a href="https://sculptnation.com/testboost"><img class="size-full wp-image-7240" src="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_194041962.jpeg?resize=1170%2C565&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1170" height="565" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_194041962.jpeg?w=3500&amp;ssl=1 3500w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_194041962.jpeg?resize=300%2C145&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_194041962.jpeg?resize=768%2C371&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_194041962.jpeg?resize=1024%2C494&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_194041962.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w" sizes="(max-width: 1170px) 100vw, 1170px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>THE IMPORTANCE OF OPTIMAL HORMONE LEVELS</strong><br />
Knowing that your hormones are messengers for pretty much every bodily function, you can understand how having balanced hormones is important if you want to look and feel your best.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, hormone imbalance is a widespread issue, and, more times than not, it goes unnoticed.</p>
<p>Most people don’t realize something is “off” until hormone levels have been changing for a while. By this time, they are already causing a number of unexplained issues.</p>
<ul>
<li>Difficulty losing weight</li>
<li>Excess storage of fat</li>
<li>Changes in appetite</li>
<li>GI Issues</li>
<li>Trouble with restful sleep</li>
<li>Exhaustion</li>
<li>Muscle weakness/loss</li>
<li>Occasional shifts in mood</li>
<li>Low sex drive</li>
</ul>
<p><em><strong>These effects can creep up slowly…</strong></em> making it difficult to even realize your body is changing. They are also often brushed aside as a “natural” result of a stress, aging, or the outcome of yet another failed diet.</p>
<p>We all require different hormone levels. But each of us&#8230; no matter weight, height, gender, sex, or race .. should ensure our hormone levels are in a normal, healthy range.</p>
<p>It takes only a small fluctuation to cause big changes.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>WHAT ARE THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF HORMONES</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Your body has two main operating systems… the nervous system and the endocrine system.</p>
<p>The endocrine system is responsible for secreting hormones into the bloodstream via numerous glands.</p>
<p>There are said to be more than 200 hormones or hormone-like substances in the body.</p>
<p><em><strong>Here is a breakdown of some of your MAIN hormones&#8230;</strong></em></p>
<ul>
<li>Thyroid Hormones (T3/T4)</li>
<li>Growth hormone</li>
<li>Leptin</li>
<li>Ghrelin</li>
<li>Insulin</li>
<li>Adrenaline</li>
<li>Serotonin</li>
<li>Estrogen</li>
<li>Progesterone</li>
<li>Cortisol</li>
<li>Testosterone</li>
</ul>
<p>As stated above, for this article, we are only focusing on two.</p>
<p>We are looking into testosterone and cortisol. The relationship researchers have discovered they have with each other&#8230; <em><strong>totally changes the way we look at “boosting” testosterone.</strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>WHAT IS TESTOSTERONE</strong></em></p>
<p><a href="https://sculptnation.com/testboost" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-7237 size-full" src="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_220530200.jpeg?resize=1170%2C780&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1170" height="780" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_220530200.jpeg?w=4000&amp;ssl=1 4000w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_220530200.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_220530200.jpeg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_220530200.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_220530200.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_220530200.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1170px) 100vw, 1170px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">If you are reading this, you need optimal testosterone levels. Testosterone is one of the main hormones responsible for your overall health.</p>
<p>Yes, it is primarily KNOWN as a male sex hormone that is made in the testes&#8230; but women produce and need testosterone.</p>
<p>Testosterone is typically associated with sex drive. It also plays a vital role in the development of muscle mass, bone density, the way you store body fat, and mood.</p>
<p><em><strong>Everyone needs testosterone and no one is safe from declining testosterone levels!</strong></em></p>
<p>There are tons of TESTOSTERONE MYTHS… here are a few we want to bust!!</p>
<p><em><strong>Testosterone is NOT only for men&#8230;</strong></em><br />
Men may make and need more, but ladies, you need this sex hormone too!</p>
<p><em><strong>Age does NOT dictate how much testosterone you have….</strong></em><br />
Just because you are YOUNG does not mean you aren’t at risk for having lower test levels!<br />
Yes, your testosterone levels naturally can decline starting in your 30’s, but this is not the only cause of lower testosterone levels.</p>
<p><em><strong>It’s NOT just some “supplement” meatheads take…</strong></em><br />
Do SOME people abuse testosterone and take a “man-made” version (thinking it will lead to greater muscle gains) &#8211; yes!</p>
<p>Man-made testosterone (an anabolic steroid) is NOT what we are referring to. Your body makes testosterone naturally, and you need optimal levels for optimal health.</p>
<p><em><strong>It’s NOT as simple as “boosting” testosterone levels…</strong> </em><br />
If low testosterone is an issue, people believe that all they need to do is BOOST the testosterone they aren’t creating. So they shell out money products that promise to boost testosterone production.</p>
<p>Sounds like the logical solution, right?</p>
<p><em><strong>NOT SO FAST</strong></em> …. these products can help you support the creation of more testosterone, but that is only HALF of the solution.</p>
<p>We stumbled upon some pretty shocking research that could explain why just <em><strong>replenishing your testosterone levels isn’t enough.</strong></em></p>
<p>There is actually a hidden factor as to why your testosterone may be low, and why modulating testosterone alone may NOT be enough.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>Do you want to promote more energy, better libido, less body fat, and more lean muscle?</strong></em><br />
<em><strong>Then you need to know about this new discovery!</strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>THE HIDDEN REASON YOUR TESTOSTERONE IS LOW</strong><a href="https://sculptnation.com/testboost" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-7235 size-full" src="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_221827769.jpeg?resize=1170%2C635&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1170" height="635" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_221827769.jpeg?w=6000&amp;ssl=1 6000w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_221827769.jpeg?resize=300%2C163&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_221827769.jpeg?resize=768%2C417&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_221827769.jpeg?resize=1024%2C556&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_221827769.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_221827769.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1170px) 100vw, 1170px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">One real reason your testosterone levels have tanked could be because you are making TOO MUCH of another hormone!</p>
<p>Harvard University conducted a groundbreaking study and had a major discovery.</p>
<p>When CORTISOL levels are too high, testosterone levels drop, and any testosterone support you try to give your body may become LESS effective.</p>
<p>If their theory is correct, then <em><strong>it may not be a lack of testosterone that is the issue</strong></em>. Instead, it could be an increase in cortisol that is STOPPING your body’s ability to make and use testosterone.</p>
<p>This means that it won’t matter how much you boost new testosterone you through supplements… <em><strong>If your cortisol is high, all the fresh testosterone in the world won’t matter, because too much of the stress hormone (cortisol) can inhibit testosterone production!!</strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>WHAT IS CORTISOL</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://sculptnation.com/testboost"><img class="size-full wp-image-7238" src="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_243475643.jpeg?resize=1170%2C780&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1170" height="780" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_243475643.jpeg?w=4500&amp;ssl=1 4500w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_243475643.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_243475643.jpeg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_243475643.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_243475643.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_243475643.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1170px) 100vw, 1170px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Cortisol is your body&#8217;s main stress hormone, but it does way more than manage stress response.</p>
<p>It is a “multi-tasking” hormone, meaning it controls many bodily functions…</p>
<ul>
<li>Fuels your body’s “fight-or-flight” instinct</li>
<li>Boosts energy levels</li>
<li>Regulates mood</li>
<li>Controls sleep/wake cycles</li>
<li>Helps control blood sugar levels</li>
<li>Manages how your body uses carbs/fats/protein</li>
<li>Regulates metabolism</li>
<li>Helps reduce inflammation</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are mentally stressed out, have an “a-type” personality, do not get enough sleep, are calorie restricted for an extended time, or are training too hard &#8211; <em><strong>there is a good chance your cortisol could be out of range.</strong></em></p>
<p>Your body NEEDS healthy levels of cortisol, but too much can lead to a host of issues.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>THE IMPORTANT RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN CORTISOL AND TESTOSTERONE</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://sculptnation.com/testboost"><img class="size-full wp-image-7236" src="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_319140527.jpeg?resize=1170%2C658&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1170" height="658" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_319140527.jpeg?w=7680&amp;ssl=1 7680w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_319140527.jpeg?resize=300%2C169&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_319140527.jpeg?resize=768%2C432&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_319140527.jpeg?resize=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_319140527.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_319140527.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1170px) 100vw, 1170px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">That study that Harvard researchers did shows us there is an important relationship between cortisol and testosterone.</p>
<p>They work against each other &#8211; and unless you get your stress levels down &#8211; cortisol is the winner.</p>
<p>Too much cortisol can cause something called <em><strong>Testosterone Suppression Response (TSR.)</strong></em></p>
<p>Basically, this means that no matter how much testosterone you’re making, if you have too much cortisol, you will struggle with TSR and continue to have the consequences of low testosterone, even if you have plenty!</p>
<p>Effects like…<br />
Loss of muscle mass .. low sex drive .. inability to lose fat .. poor sleep quality .. etc.</p>
<p>As a result, even if you use testosterone boosters, it may not matter if your cortisol is elevated.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>HOW TO CURB THE TESTOSTERONE SUPPRESSION RESPONSE (TSR)</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Your most important line of defense is lowering your cortisol levels.</p>
<p>We put together a <a href="https://sculptnation.com/testboost">2-minute at home test</a> you can take to help determine if you have too much cortisol. We will tell you where you can go to take that in just a moment.</p>
<p>First, we want to give you a couple of methods to lower cortisol and fight TSR….</p>
<p><strong>Manage Stress Levels (mental and physical)</strong><br />
The most effective way to lower your cortisol levels is to get your stress under control. Stress is not just mental .. it can be any physical stress you are placing on your body as well.</p>
<p><strong>Focus on quality sleep</strong><br />
You need 7-9 hours of quality sleep every single night (minimum) to keep your cortisol levels in check. This can be virtually impossible if your cortisol is high because cortisol regulates your sleep/wake cycle.</p>
<p><strong>These changes are challenging to adhere to!</strong> Avoiding cortisol spiking stressors is pretty much IMPOSSIBLE! We face stress every day. Even dieting and exercising can cause your body to be “stressed out.” And how can you get quality sleep if your sleep/wake cycle is messed up!?</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>Thankfully… THERE IS ONE OTHER WAY TO HELP FIGHT BACK!!!</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>Focus on diet &amp; supplementing with cortisol lowering/test boosting support supplements…</strong></em> There are some nutrients you can take daily that help support a reduction in cortisol levels, as well as a few foods you should try to TOTALLY AVOID.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://sculptnation.com/testboost" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>CLICK HERE to discover&#8230;</strong></em></a><br />
<em><strong>AN EASY and SCIENTIFICALLY backed way to give your body the </strong></em><br />
<em><strong>cortisol crushing nutrients it needs&#8230;</strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>The 4 foods you need to avoid…</strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>A 2-minute quiz to help you determine if your cortisol is high ..</strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>++ More on that groundbreaking testosterone/cortisol study&#8230;</strong></em></p>
<p>Researchers also found that the effects cortisol have on testosterone are reversed when stress levels go down.</p>
<p>This is GOOD NEWS! Now that we know that high cortisol blocking your testosterone IS an issue… we can fight back!!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>In this video, we explain everything you need to know about TSR and </strong></em><br />
<em><strong>an effective approach to knocking it out! </strong></em><br />

<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>THE LONGER YOU WAIT &#8211; THE WORSE THINGS WILL GET</strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Your body will continue to struggle as this testosterone suppression response continues, and it will only get worse if you don&#8217;t take charge and destroy your ability to make and use testosterone.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>Boosting your testosterone is great, but it’s a complete waste of time</strong></em><br />
<em><strong>if you aren’t blocking cortisol too.</strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>We have discovered <a href="https://sculptnation.com/testboost" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">THE ONLY testosterone maximizing method</a> available that is specifically designed to support healthy testosterone while minimizing and balancing the effects of cortisol.</strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://sculptnation.com/testboost" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>CLICK HERE TO FIND OUT FOR YOURSELF</strong></em></a></p>
<p><em><strong>REMEMBER… You need OPTIMAL TESTOSTERONE LEVELS if you want support to…</strong></em></p>

<p>It is officially (unofficial) .. <em><strong>summer is here!!</strong></em></p>
<p>Memorial Day marks the unofficial start of summer, and I don’t know about you, but I’m excited to take some of my workouts outside!</p>
<p>Today we’ve got a full-body workout that you can do from your backyard or wherever your Memorial Day weekend takes you!</p>
<p>It doesn’t require any equipment. We are using bodyweight only, and it can be adjusted to any fitness level!</p>
<p>Of course, you can do this working indoors if you choose, but as long as you are hydrated, try breaking a sweat outside!</p>
<p>Taking your workouts outdoors has a ton of benefits .. here are a few!</p>
<p><strong>3 BENEFITS OF EXERCISING OUTSIDE</strong></p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-7153" src="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_222896530.jpeg?resize=1170%2C780&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1170" height="780" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_222896530.jpeg?w=5040&amp;ssl=1 5040w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_222896530.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_222896530.jpeg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_222896530.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_222896530.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_222896530.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1170px) 100vw, 1170px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><strong>1: You May Burn More Calories</strong><br />
Some small studies found outdoor exercisers burn a few more calories than those who exercise indoors. The theory is that exercising outdoors exerts more energy.</p>
<p>Be careful.. this could have the opposite effect if you are attempting to workout when temperatures are extreme.</p>
<p>Working out when it’s too hot could affect your endurance. You may also be more tempted to shorten the duration of your workout.</p>
<p>Try doing your outdoor workouts early in the morning before temperatures spike, or later in the evening.</p>
<p>Always stay extra hydrated and above all.. listen to your body!</p>
<p><strong>2: It Could Cheer You Up</strong><br />
Hundreds of studies have shown that soaking up the sun and being surrounded by mother nature helps alleviate stress and improve overall mood!</p>
<p>Exercising outdoors has even been shown to enhance your brain! Researchers say this is because being outside stimulates all five senses at once &#8211; something that can’t be achieved inside a gym or your living room.</p>
<p>Head outside .. breathe in some fresh air .. take a moment to appreciate the beauty around you! Maybe even take off your headphones and listen to the sounds of nature!</p>
<p>A little natural Vitamin D is no doubt a great motivator to get moving!</p>
<p><strong>3: It Saves You Money</strong><br />
Gym memberships are not cheap. Not to mention, they often go unused.</p>
<p>How many times have you paid for a year and only showed up once or twice a week, or even worse, gone months without entering a building that you pay to use?</p>
<p>If you can go every day, a gym membership is no doubt worth the money. But despite what most believe, it’s not required to get in a solid training session.</p>
<p>That is why we focus on so many home workouts on our <strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/vshred" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">YouTube Channel</a></strong>, and why we recently created an entire program called <a href="https://vshred.com/sp/move/soc-all" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MOVE</a> that can be done from home.

<p>If you have a lot of weight to lose, or if you are just trying to lose that last layer of fat covering your mid-section, THIS <em><strong><a href="https://sculptnation.com/products/fat-loss-stack" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FAT LOSS STACK</a> could help!</strong></em></p>
<p>Now, of course, you can’t just take some supplements and do this short ab workout we are about to show you, and expect to be shredded.</p>
<p>You have to exercise and follow a nutrition plan that is best for your body type. If you aren’t sure what yours is .. check out this <strong><a href="https://vshred.com/sp/survey/survey-aka1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FREE QUIZ</a></strong>! It will tell you what your body type is and give you 3 most important things you need to do to get in shape based on the way YOU are built!</p>
<p>If you have put off getting in shape for summer, you may be tempted to set unrealistic goals or turn to some silly quick-fix detox diet… <em><strong>don’t do that!</strong></em></p>
<p>First of all, there is no such thing. Second, no matter what your short-term goals are, your focus should always be on long-term success.</p>
<p>Training and eating for <a href="https://vshred.com/sp/survey/survey-aka1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">your body type</a> will always be the best way to achieve that!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>Now that we’ve covered the most important bases to help you reveal that summer six-pack… let’s get to BUILDING your abs … with this killer core workout!</strong></em></p>

<p>Since the sun is finally shining brighter and temperatures are rising a bit, we want to encourage you to<em><strong> take some of your workouts OUTDOORS!</strong></em></p>
<p>Lack of motivation is one of the biggest reasons people skip training. There&#8217;s nothing quite like surrounding yourself with nature and breathing in some fresh air. It is the perfect motivator to get you moving!</p>
<p>Being outdoors helps lower stress, clears your mind, improves happiness, and according to some studies, can even up your calorie burn a little bit!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>Put on some SPF, pound some <a href="https://sculptnation.com/products/pre-workout" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pre-workout</a> to help you push through, </strong></em><br />
<em><strong>head outside to a nice even spot in the grass, and follow along for this</strong></em><br />
<em><strong>5 Exercise Ab Workout .. that will leave your core on fire!</strong></em></p>

<p>If there was a magic pill that allowed you to not exercise, eat what you want, and never gain an ounce of fat… everyone would be walking around with a six-pack and a slice of pizza.</p>
<p>There is no such thing.</p>
<p>But if some of the top researchers in the world are correct .. <em><strong>there may be a BIOLOGICAL “LOOPHOLE”</strong></em> … that helps support the speed of the metabolism (which dictates how much fat you can lose.)</p>
<p>It’s so effective… <em><strong>they are calling it “THE FUTURE OF FAT LOSS”!!</strong></em></p>
<p>This IS going to sound too good to be true.<br />
This IS going to sound like a bunch of hype.</p>
<p>Because this loophole is NOT a diet plan, a workout video, or anything else you may think of when it comes to burning fat.</p>
<p>We had a hard time believing it too.</p>
<p>But the science on this one is pretty clear.<br />
<em><strong>This discovery is all about how your body, and your fat cells, communicate.</strong></em></p>
<p>Once you change this communication process, it seems that it is possible to <em><strong>force your body to support burning it’s deepest fat stores</strong></em>. You know, the ones that seem immune to hardcore workouts and ultra-strict diets.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>It can all happen because of something called … Simultaneous Fat Release.</strong></em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>How do you promote the activation of your body’s “simultaneous fat release” capabilities?<br />
We are about to tell you!!</p>
<p>It’s crazy!! But once you know how to change the conversation that’s happening between your fat cells… you can finally help alter the way your body burns fat ..rapidly!</p>
<p><em><strong>For real! This hack only takes about 30 seconds to add to your day!!</strong></em></p>
<p>Before we tell you what scientists say the solution is .. let’s go back to the first discovery researchers made .. so that we can better understand why all this happens to begin with.</p>
<p><strong>FAT CELL SIGNALING</strong><br />
Researchers found that our fat cells talk to each other. It’s called Fat Cell Signaling.</p>
<p>Fat cells are not merely big blobs that sit in silence. They are rather chatty and not only talk to each other, but to other cells in your body.</p>
<p>Right now, as you read this, your fat cells are deciding whether or not they are going to put your body into fat-burning mode or fat-storing mode.</p>
<p>If you <span style="text-decoration: underline;">NEVER</span> struggle with your weight… congrats! That means your fat cells are probably having a nice chat.</p>
<p>However, if you feel like you struggle to lose weight, those same 10 pounds keep coming back, most diets fail, or you can’t seem to get rid of “stubborn” areas of fat .. your fat cells are most likely having a conversation you don’t want them to have.</p>
<p>Most of us fall into that second category because our bodies were designed to store fat.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>Chances are the conversation your cells are having over-and-over again ..</strong></em><br />
<em><strong>is to HOLD ON to fat .. not burn it.</strong></em></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-7130" src="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_209544099.jpeg?resize=1170%2C780&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1170" height="780" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_209544099.jpeg?w=5910&amp;ssl=1 5910w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_209544099.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_209544099.jpeg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_209544099.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_209544099.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_209544099.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1170px) 100vw, 1170px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>This means you can do all the cardio in the world and eat an overly restrictive diet but still be holding on to a stubborn layer of fat!</p>
<p>Of course, how much body fat you have will depend on lots of factors (diet, exercise, stress, sleep, genetics, etc.) But your fat cells ultimately make this decision through that constant communication (fat cell signaling).</p>
<p>This new research also explains why some of the most popular American diets don’t work long term. Sorry “keto” and “low-fat” .. science says your restrictive diets DO NOT have the ability to change the way your fat cells communicate.</p>
<p>However, scientists discovered a receptor in your body that CAN help alter this communication process. Once “activated”, it can help complement any “diet” and exercise program you choose.<br />
It’s called the TRPV1 Receptor.</p>
<p><strong>WHAT IS THE TRPV1 RECEPTOR</strong><br />
A professor of neurosurgery, biological chemistry, and neuroscience at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine was the first to discover this receptor.</p>
<p>You have TRPV1 Receptors throughout your entire body. Their main job is to regulate your body’s temperature and energy usage. It kicks in when your body temperature increases.</p>
<p>For example, when you are doing cardio or working out. TRPV1 senses this temperature spike and tells your fat cells to start burning their contents for energy.</p>
<p><strong>WHAT HAPPENS WHEN TRPV1 RECEPTORS ARE ACTIVATED (“Simultaneous Fat Release”)</strong><br />
Now it’s time to tell you about that “loophole” we mentioned.</p>
<p>Scientists discovered that when these receptors are activated, they help tell your fat cells to start communicating differently. They tell them to burn themselves for energy, instead of holding on and storing in places like your stomach and thighs.</p>
<p>This is important….<br />
It means that TRPV1 can actually alter the conversation that’s happening between your fat cells. In fact, they found <em><strong>when you activate TRPV1 Receptors, you can support fat burning virtually EVERYWHERE .</strong></em></p>
<p>The ability to burn fat EVERYWHERE all at once is called “Simultaneous Fat Release.”</p>
<p>This process can force your body to support burning the fat you already have (even your deepest fat stores)..</p>
<p><em><strong>Simultaneous Fat Release can fundamentally transform your body’s relationship with fat…</strong></em> because once you activate your body’s “simultaneous fat release” capabilities.. you can stay in fat-burning support mode virtually all day …burning unhealthy fat build-up EVERYWHERE in your body.</p>
<p><strong>HOW TO ACTIVATE TRPV1 RECEPTORS (simultaneous fat release)</strong></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-7131" src="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_342916350.jpeg?resize=1170%2C771&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1170" height="771" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_342916350.jpeg?w=4802&amp;ssl=1 4802w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_342916350.jpeg?resize=300%2C198&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_342916350.jpeg?resize=768%2C506&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_342916350.jpeg?resize=1024%2C675&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_342916350.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_342916350.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1170px) 100vw, 1170px" data-recalc-dims="1" /><br />
As mentioned, one way to activate the TRPV1 Receptors is through super-intense workouts.<br />
But scientists have found that we can also activate our TRV1 Receptors another way.</p>
<p>They discovered that these receptors can also be activated by eating a common spice found in red chili peppers. It’s called Capsaicin.</p>
<p>Over the years, NUMEROUS studies have been done on the effectiveness of Capsaicin.</p>
<p><em><strong>Here are the findings of only A FEW ….</strong></em></p>
<ul>
<li>“Capsaicin was found to enhance energy expenditure and fat burning in humans, particularly those with a high Body Mass Index (BMI.)”</li>
<li>“Participants in the Capsaicin group saw a significant decrease in stomach fat when used as part of a weight management program.”</li>
<li>“The Capsaicin group lost nearly double the weight of the placebo group.”</li>
<li>“The Capsaicin group increased their body’s fat-burning potential by up to 46.4% when used daily for 8 weeks, while the placebo group saw no improvement at all.”</li>
<li>“Capsaicin activates TRPV1 Receptors and significantly increases metabolism and fat burning potential.”</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>OF COURSE, it’s not as easy as eating some red chili peppers!!</strong></em></p>
<p>All of the studies mentioned used a Capsaicin supplement. That is because the amount of chili peppers needed to activate your TRPV1 receptors is very high. It would make you physically sick if you attempted to EAT that many chili peppers (don&#8217;t do that.)</p>
<p>With a supplement, you can safely consume Capsaicin at a much higher quantity.</p>
<p>BEFORE YOU EXIT THIS ARTICLE and attempt to “google” Capsaicin ..<em><strong> there is something very important you need to know about this spice.</strong></em></p>
<p>The supplement form of Capsaicin isn’t hard to find. However, it can vary dramatically both in quality and effectiveness.</p>
<p>You have to ensure that the Capsaicin you choose is time-released and has a special coating.</p>
<p>For that reason, there’s only one form of Capsaicin that we stand behind. <em><strong>This specific formula of Capsaicin has already helped over 1.2 Million people (and counting) finally lose fat and help keep it off when combined with diet and exercise!</strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>THIS FORM OF CAPSAICIN is in high demand &#8211; but very limited supply.</strong></em></p>
<p>Only a select group of supplement manufacturers can get access to this specific form of Capsaicin.</p>
<p>Whether you are making progress but can’t seem to blast that last bit of fat, or are just getting started and have a long way to go, you can provide support to help SPEED UP fat loss once you tell your fat cells how to communicate with each other!</p>

<p>Motherhood is a mix of many things….<br />
It is a blessing, but it can also be frustrating, hectic, and at times, even monotonous.<br />
It is beautiful knowing that you are helping shape a future generation, but that also brings about a lot of pressure and responsibility.</p>
<p>You are always going mentally and physically, which means just like any other job, burnout is bound to happen<em><strong> if you don’t s-l-o-w down!!</strong></em></p>
<p>If you are a mom reading this… we want you to ask yourself a few important questions.</p>
<ul>
<li>When is the last time I put my needs first?</li>
<li>Do I regularly focus on self-care?</li>
<li>Do I have a good mom/life balance?</li>
</ul>
<p>You likely answered…</p>
<ul>
<li>Rarely/Never</li>
<li>No, not regularly.</li>
<li>What is life .. outside of being a mom?</li>
</ul>
<p>Being a mom has required responsibilities, but you have to stop and think about <em><strong>your own needs</strong></em>. Going non-stop can take a toll on both your mental and physical health.</p>
<p>How can you be SUPERMOM if you aren’t taking time to REST and RECHARGE?</p>
<p><strong>Easier said than done, right?</strong><br />
It SOUNDS great to be able to pour a glass of wine, put on a face mask, jump in a bubble bath, and turn on a meditation app.</p>
<p>In REALITY, you haven’t had time to go to the store to get groceries, your kid’s toys are still in the tub that you haven’t had time to clean, and if you do manage to hop in, forget silence. It won’t be long before there is a little knock at the door, interrupting your zen!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>BUT MOMS… LISTEN UP!</strong></p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-7087" src="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_221068765.jpeg?resize=1170%2C780&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1170" height="780" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_221068765.jpeg?w=6500&amp;ssl=1 6500w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_221068765.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_221068765.jpeg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_221068765.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_221068765.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_221068765.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1170px) 100vw, 1170px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>To be able to take care of everyone else, you have to feel your best both physically and mentally.</p>
<p>Self-care is not selfish .. it’s actually the opposite.<em><strong> A happy and fulfilled mom .. is no doubt a better mom!</strong></em></p>
<p>Use Mother’s Day as a reminder that YOU ARE SPECIAL and deserve just as much TLC as everyone else in your family!</p>
<p>Here are FIVE IDEAS that will help give you the mental and physical energy needed to tackle both the chaos and glory that make up motherhood!!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>5 Ways To Focus On Self-Care This Mother’s Day</strong></p>
<p>Self-Care is a personal process. What helps you unwind may be different than what helps somebody else de-stress. However, these 5 self-care tips are things ALL busy moms should consider.</p>
<p>Remember, self-care isn’t just a day at the spa or date night without the kids.<br />
It is ANY activity you do that will improve your mental, spiritual, and physical health.</p>
<p>In fact, the best types of self-care aren’t about only feeling good in the moment. Just like your health and fitness journey… the ultimate goal of self-care should be its long-term effects!</p>
<p><strong>1: DISCONNECT</strong></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-7088" src="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_338261185.jpeg?resize=1170%2C780&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1170" height="780" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_338261185.jpeg?w=7776&amp;ssl=1 7776w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_338261185.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_338261185.jpeg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_338261185.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_338261185.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_338261185.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1170px) 100vw, 1170px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>Put your computer away, turn off your phone, don’t tune into the news, and click out of Netflix.</p>
<p>Sometimes the most effective thing you can do for yourself has little to do with what TO DO and more to do with what you DO NOT DO!</p>
<p>While it is great to be informed and socially connected .. <em><strong>too much time plugged in can add to your stress, anxiety, and life fears.</strong></em></p>
<p>This is especially true for social media. It is one thing if you <em><strong>only</strong></em> follow accounts that motivate you and feed you with positivity. But many of us “follow” the lives of others and end up comparing, leading to feelings of not being good enough.</p>
<p>Social media can also be a rabbit hole of negativity and biased opinions, leaving you confused, negative, anxious, uptight, and even angry. <em><strong>Put yourself on a social media diet and limit your screen-time and scrolling.</strong></em></p>
<p>The same “digital detox” rules should also apply for TV time. The news (especially these days) can only fuel your fears.<em><strong> If you must watch, tune in only to be informed and immediately power off!</strong></em></p>
<p>If binge-watching Netflix is how you like to unwind, go for it! But the next time you have watched enough episodes for it to ask you &#8211; “are you still watching” &#8211; consider doing something else relaxing that could be more beneficial to your long term mental health.</p>

<p><strong>2: GET REGULAR SLEEP</strong></p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-7089" src="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_233195435.jpeg?resize=1170%2C781&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1170" height="781" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_233195435.jpeg?w=7360&amp;ssl=1 7360w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_233195435.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_233195435.jpeg?resize=768%2C513&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_233195435.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_233195435.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_233195435.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1170px) 100vw, 1170px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>In an attempt to do as much as possible with the 24 hours given, most moms sacrifice sleep and end up sleep-deprived.</p>
<p>While it may seem like the only way to get everything done, exhaustion only slows you down, making you less productive while you are awake.</p>
<p>Getting quality shut-eye is crucial to maintaining your physical and mental health. 7-9 hours of sleep is non-negotiable if you want to be able to have the clarity and energy needed to tackle your mile-long list of supermom tasks.</p>
<p>Even more than slowing down to get in bed, sometimes the ability to actually fall asleep is the biggest challenge busy moms face.</p>
<p>It is common to replay all the events of your stress-filled day or go over your endless mom to-do-list in your head.</p>
<p>Here are a few tips to help you get that critical shut-eye!</p>
<ul>
<li>Go back to self-care tip #1 and UNPLUG at least one-hour before bedtime.</li>
<li>Do 5-10 minutes of stretching or yoga.</li>
<li>Take a warm bath just before laying down.</li>
<li>Eat a <a href="https://sculptnation.com/products/protein" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">protein</a>-rich meal that isn’t too heavy.</li>
<li>Write in your journal, specifically a gratitude journal.</li>
<li>Try to be in bed around the same time every night.</li>
<li>Try some breathing techniques.</li>
<li>Use a weighted blanket.</li>
<li>Use Essential Oils &amp; Aromatherapy Machines</li>
<li>Incorporate natural <a href="https://sculptnation.com/products/burn-pm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">sleep-enhancing supplements</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Our favorite supplement for sleep is a product called <a href="https://sculptnation.com/products/burn-pm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BURN PM</a>.</p>
<p>It contains relaxation agents like L-Tryptophan and Melatonin that will help support falling asleep, enter deep sleep faster, and stay there longer. Perfect for occasional sleeplessness. But we took <a href="https://sculptnation.com/products/burn-pm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">our nighttime sleep aid</a> a step further and added nighttime thermogenics that are designed to help support fat burning while you sleep.</p>
<p>As a special Mother’s Day gift to you .. we are giving all moms an extra 30% off <a href="https://sculptnation.com/products/burn-pm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BURN PM</a> (and any other supplement you choose) when you use code: <a href="https://sculptnation.com/products/burn-pm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>MOMSDAY30</strong></a> at checkout! <a href="https://sculptnation.com/products/burn-pm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Click Here to shop.</a></p>

<p><strong>3: Perform A Health Check</strong></p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-7090" src="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_309968852.jpeg?resize=1170%2C780&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1170" height="780" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_309968852.jpeg?w=5472&amp;ssl=1 5472w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_309968852.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_309968852.jpeg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_309968852.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_309968852.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_309968852.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1170px) 100vw, 1170px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>You wouldn&#8217;t let your kids skip their yearly dental cleaning or wellness check, and you are probably constantly on to your significant other to see their primary care provider for an annual check-up. But are you too busy worrying about everyone else&#8217;s preventative health .. that you are forgetting about your own?</p>
<p>Take some time to look at your calendar and see when you can schedule YOUR regular doctor appointments for things like yearly blood work, exams, scans, cleanings, etc.</p>
<p>You should always try to be ahead of any potential health issues. Getting sick could leave you down and out for days or weeks … <em><strong>and we all know moms don’t get sick days!</strong></em></p>
<p>Book those yearly check-ups, then head to your kitchen and take inventory of <em><strong>other ways you could improve your overall health through supplementation and diet.</strong></em></p>
<p>Stock your pantry and fridge with healthy choices that are easy to grab and go. We always keep a container of <a href="https://sculptnation.com/products/protein" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sculpt Nation Protein</a> on hand for shakes, smoothies, and even simple things like <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/pumpkin-spice-protein/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">protein pancakes</a>. This will ensure you are less tempted to reach for your kid’s snacks when you are too busy to cook.</p>
<p>Two of our favorite supplements that assist in optimizing overall health are <a href="https://sculptnation.com/products/greens" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GREENS</a> and <a href="https://sculptnation.com/products/turmeric" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TURMERIC</a>.</p>
<p>It is hard to get in the nutrients your body needs through diet alone. Adding quality <a href="https://sculptnation.com/products/greens" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GREENS</a> helps close that gap.</p>
<p><a href="https://sculptnation.com/products/greens" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sculpt Nation GREENS</a> is a delicious superfood that is packed with herbs, botanicals, antioxidants, and agents that support a healthy inflammatory response. Just one dose gives you an added boost of powerful superfoods.</p>
<p>In addition to assisting in revitalizing your mental and physical energy, our <a href="https://sculptnation.com/products/greens" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GREENS</a> help prime and support your body and brain to be able to better burn fat, build muscle, and increase performance.</p>
<p>Another supplement you may want to consider to stay healthy is <a href="https://sculptnation.com/products/turmeric" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TURMERIC</a>.</p>
<p>This super-nutrient has been used for centuries to optimize health. But in recent years, studies have found that turmeric goes beyond helping with things like temporary pain related to exercise or supporting a healthy inflammatory response. They discovered it can potentially assist in fighting fatigue, burning body fat, enhancing mental clarity, and help ease gastrointestinal issues such as occasional bloating.</p>
<p>Sculpt Nation&#8217;s <a href="https://sculptnation.com/products/turmeric" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TURMERIC</a> not only provides you with the exact dose you need to see and feel benefits, our proprietary blend includes other key nutrients required for this powerful herb to be absorbed.</p>
<p>That 30% off special Mother’s Day discount can also be used on these products!<br />

<p><strong>4: Exercise</strong></p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-7091" src="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_167087638.jpeg?resize=1170%2C695&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1170" height="695" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_167087638.jpeg?w=5759&amp;ssl=1 5759w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_167087638.jpeg?resize=300%2C178&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_167087638.jpeg?resize=768%2C456&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_167087638.jpeg?resize=1024%2C608&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_167087638.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_167087638.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1170px) 100vw, 1170px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>For some moms, a workout is the perfect escape. For others, working out may seem more like a chore than a treat.</p>
<p>Like it or not, exercise is one of the best (if not THE best) ways you can take care of yourself.</p>
<p>Getting in some sort of daily physical activity can enhance mood, reduce stress, and give you a major self-esteem boost!</p>
<p>The number one reason most moms skip the gym is that they can&#8217;t find the time.</p>
<p><em><strong>If inking in a sweat session seems impossible</strong></em>, you can always try INCLUDING your kids in your workout!</p>
<p>It may not be IDEAL .. or the escape you want .. but at least you will be able to get it done! <a href="https://vshred.com/blog/strong-as-a-mother-mommy-me-workouts-for-every-age/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Check out this article for OVER 30 kid-friendly exercise ideas!</a></p>
<p>So, get out of your comfy mom sweats, throw on some workout clothes, put on your favorite playlist, and get moving!</p>
<p>If you need some ideas that don’t involve your kids, we have thousands of FREE home workouts on our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/vshred" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">YouTube Channel</a>. Many can be done with no equipment and in 20 minutes or less!</p>
<p><strong>5: Do Nothing (Zero. Zilch. Nada.)</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-7121" src="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_307475146-1.jpeg?resize=1170%2C780&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1170" height="780" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_307475146-1.jpeg?w=5760&amp;ssl=1 5760w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_307475146-1.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_307475146-1.jpeg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_307475146-1.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_307475146-1.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_307475146-1.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1170px) 100vw, 1170px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Go to your room, sit outside, or even get in your car! Go anywhere you can find some peace and quiet and don’t do ANYTHING … other than closing your eyes and listening to your heart.</p>
<p>This is different from meditating, where you attempt to clear your mind of ANY thoughts.</p>
<p>With this type of mental mindfulness, you are simply slowing down long enough to listen to the desires hidden deep within you.</p>
<p>The purpose of this self-care exercise is not to leave you sad or anxious. The goal is to reconnect with yourself so that you can be more aware of any area of your life that may be lacking.</p>
<p>This is a great way to explore yourself to determine any areas of your life that are fulfilling and possibly lacking.</p>
<p>Think about things you love, ways you have been ignoring your needs and desires, and what you want out of your life … aside from being a good mom.</p>
<p>“Mom life” can get so busy that it’s common to forget who you are and what makes you happy.<br />
Take a moment to self-reflect!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>TAKE SOME TIME TO SELF CARE</strong><br />
<strong>AND</strong><br />
<strong>DO NOT FEEL GUILTY ABOUT IT!</strong></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-7093" src="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_332558922.jpeg?resize=1170%2C641&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1170" height="641" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_332558922.jpeg?w=5760&amp;ssl=1 5760w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_332558922.jpeg?resize=300%2C164&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_332558922.jpeg?resize=768%2C421&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_332558922.jpeg?resize=1024%2C561&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_332558922.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_332558922.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1170px) 100vw, 1170px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>Far too often, moms are flooded with feelings of guilt when they actually do take time to break-free from mom life and take care of themselves.</p>
<p>Whether you decide to wake up 10 minutes early to sit and enjoy your cup of coffee alone before your crazy day begins, or take two hours to train and go to the spa, <em><strong>never feel guilty about time spent ON YOU!</strong></em></p>
<p>Self-care is an essential part of motherhood! The more time you can set aside to take care of your own needs, the happier you will be. Which will only bring more happiness, energy, and love to those around you!</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Newborn/Infant Workout Ideas Ideas</strong></p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-7097" src="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_249502416.jpeg?resize=1170%2C698&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1170" height="698" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_249502416.jpeg?w=5468&amp;ssl=1 5468w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_249502416.jpeg?resize=300%2C179&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_249502416.jpeg?resize=768%2C458&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_249502416.jpeg?resize=1024%2C611&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_249502416.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_249502416.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1170px) 100vw, 1170px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Congrats! You have the perfect human dumbbell! They may cry, kick, and scream at times .. but on the bright side, that just provides a little more resistance, right?</p>
<p>Another perk of using your infant for resistance is that you will naturally use progressive overload because infants grow….fast! This means that almost weekly your “weight” will become heavier and more of a challenge!</p>
<p>When it comes to a newborn/infant, you will need to be selective with exercise choice and modify how you hold your baby if they are unable to hold their head up on their own. And for all you new mamas .. you always want to have approval from your doctor before resuming physical activity post-pregnancy!</p>
<p><em><strong>Using your baby instead of a traditional weight is an easy modification to make!</strong></em><br />
Take a look at any weight lifting workout you currently do or find one of our home workouts on the V Shred <a href="https://www.youtube.com/vshred" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">YouTube Channel</a> that uses simple weights like dumbbells.</p>
<p>Instead of holding the weight .. carefully hold your baby! Or if you have a body baby carrier, strap them in and get to work!</p>
<p><em><strong>Here is an idea!</strong></em><br />
Do an EMOM workout! This training style isn’t technically named after you mamas, but EMOM workouts are a great way to get in a good workout if you have limited time (which we know is an issue for many moms.)</p>
<p>EMOM stands for every minute on the minute. You perform a different exercise every minute. You begin the prescribed number of reps at the top of the minute and then get to rest for whatever time is left until the next top of the minute!</p>
<ul>
<li>Pick any movements from the list below or use your own.</li>
<li>Set a timer for the length you choose. We like using a duration of 10 minutes. That means you will be doing 10 different</li>
<li>exercises, in only 10 minutes!</li>
<li>When all exercises are complete, rest &amp; repeat as many times as you want!</li>
<li>You can use the same movements for your next round(s) &#8211; or pick different ones.</li>
<li>We like doing 30 total minutes, if possible. The first round upper body, second round lower body, and the third round abs &amp; cardio.</li>
</ul>
<p>Remember, your goal is to get in the prescribed number of reps in less than a minute.<br />
The faster you finish .. the more rest time you get! You may need to adjust reps based on your fitness level.</p>

<p><strong>Baby Squat Shoulder Press (15 reps)</strong><br />
Stand with feet slightly wider than shoulder-width apart and your toes pointed slightly out. Hold your baby with hands positioned under armpits. While holding the baby, perform your squat, and as you come up, lift the baby into the air above your head into a shoulder press.</p>
<p><strong>Baby Squat Front Delt Raise (15 reps)</strong><br />
Perform these the same way as the baby squat above, except raise your baby up into a front raise (to about chest height) as you lower into your squat.</p>
<p><strong>Baby Squat Press (15 reps)</strong><br />
Perform these the same way as the baby squat above, except hold your baby close to your chest and push out into a chest press as you squat down.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>**Change your with foot position if you are incorporating more than one squat press into your EMOM workout! Go super wide into a sumo stance more glute/hamstring focused squats, or super wide with toes pointed further out in a plie position to work inner thighs**</em></p>
<p><strong>Forward Lunge With Baby Twist (5 reps each leg, for 10 total twisting lunges)</strong><br />
Hold your baby in whatever position you find most comfortable. Lunge forward with your right leg. Before you bring your left foot forward, twist/rotate your upper body to the right while leaving your lower body stationary in the lunge position. Rotate back to center and bring your back foot forward to complete the lunge. Do the same thing on the opposite side, always twisting in the direction of your front foot. Continue walking forward until you have completed 10 total steps.</p>
<p><strong>Loving Walking Lunges (10 each leg for 20 total steps)</strong><br />
Do these in the same way you perform the walking lunge with a twist; however, you do not do the twist; you simply keep walking and lunging!</p>
<p><strong>Baby Weight Glute Bridge (15 slow and controlled reps)</strong><br />
Lie on your back with your knees bent and your feet hip-distance apart. Place your baby on your lap. Raise your hips into a glute bridge (try to keep most of the weight in your heels) and squeeze big at the top before slowly lowering back to the floor.</p>
<p><strong>Baby Ab Crunch (15 crunches)</strong><br />
Lie face-up on the floor with your knees bent in the air at a 90-degree angle.<br />
Stabilize your baby, so it is resting on your shins, and hold onto his/her hands.<br />
To perform the crunch, slowly extend your legs away from you as you lift your shoulder blades off the ground. Slowly curl your upper body forward into a crunch, and at the same time, bring your knees in toward your chest. Stretch your legs out while leaning back &#8211; as far as you can reach. Repeat.</p>
<p><strong>Baby Chest Press (15 presses)</strong><br />
Lie on your back with your knees bent and your feet hip-distance apart. Place your baby on your chest and press them toward the ceiling. Squeeze your pecs together before lowering them back to the starting position.</p>
<p><img class="size-large wp-image-7114" src="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_228555310-1.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_228555310-1.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_228555310-1.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_228555310-1.jpeg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_228555310-1.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><strong>Standard Push-Up Kisses (15 pushups)</strong><br />
On a mat, lay your baby underneath you. Start in a high plank position with your wrists under your elbows and your abs engaged. Lower down until your elbows are bent to 90 degrees, and give your baby a kiss! Come to your knees to make the push-up easier.</p>
<p><strong>Tricep Push-Up Kisses (15 pushups)</strong><br />
Perform these push-ups the same way you do the standard push up above, except you will keep your arms parallel to your sides and your elbows pointing back. Come to your knees to make the push-up easier.</p>
<p><strong>Burpee Kisses (10 burpees)</strong><br />
Perform in the same way you did the push-ups. You may need to scoot your baby slightly forward since you will need enough room to jump or step your feet forward to perform your burpee. You can skip the pushup portion if you want to make these less advanced.</p>
<p><strong>Baby Lat Pullover (15 pullovers)</strong><br />
Lie on your back with your knees bent and your feet flat. Sit your baby on your chest, holding them under their arms. Lift them straight up, keeping your arms mostly straight, with only a slight bend in your elbows to prevent locking, throughout the entire movement. Extend your arms backward over your head as far back as you can. Return to the starting position by slowly pulling and squeezing with your lats and chest. Watch for those kicking little feet &#8211; otherwise, you might end up with a foot to the face 🙂</p>
<p><strong>Baby Bicep Hammer Curls (15 curls)</strong><br />
Hold your baby in front of you. Keeping elbows glued to your sides, and raise him or her to your chest in a curl. Don’t let your elbows swing outward and squeeze your biceps hard at the top of the movement. Return to start to complete one rep.</p>
<p><strong>Tummy Time Human Supermoms (10 supermans, with a hold at top)</strong><br />
On a mat, lay your baby on its tummy. Lay on your stomach face to face with your baby.<br />
Keep your neck in a neutral position and extend your arms and legs out straight out and wide.<br />
Keep your arms and legs straight and tummy glued to the mat as you simultaneously lift your arms and legs up toward the ceiling. Squeeze your lower back and glutes and hold for two to five seconds before you lower back down to the starting position.</p>
<p><strong>Tummy Time Human Lat Pulldowns (15 pullbacks with a big squeeze)</strong><br />
In the same position as the supermoms, do the exact same movement. Instead of holding at the top of the movement, pull your elbows down to your sides and squeeze. Reverse the movement. That is one rep. You can use a loop band or even a rolled up towel to make these even more difficult!</p>

<p><strong>Baby Reverse Ab Crunches (15 crunches)</strong><br />
Lie face up on the floor, and bring your knees toward your chest. Place your baby on your shins. Contract your abs to gently tilt your hips up off the floor as you lift your head and shoulders at the same time. Lower and repeat.</p>
<p><strong>Pop Jump Peek-A-Boo (15 jumps)</strong><br />
Lay your baby on a mat in front of you. Start with your feet together and then jump your legs out as far as you can into a low squat. Immediately jump back to your starting position. Play a game of peek-a-boo with your hands as you “pop” for each rep! Go fast! This is a cardio plyometric move to get your heart rate up!</p>
<p><strong>Tickle Squat Jumps (15 jumps)</strong><br />
This is another plyometric cardio movement. Lay your baby on a mat in front of you. Perform squat jumps, and at the bottom of every jump, give your baby a little toe tickle! Get creative! You can do this for any jumping “plyo” type movement (jumping lunges, starfish jumps, skaters, etc.)</p>
<p><strong>Baby Swings (15 swings)</strong><br />
Hold your baby under its arms facing you. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart.<br />
With a slight bend in your knees, your back flat and neck straight, hinge your hips back as you swing your baby between the inside the quads and then forcefully drive your hips forward as you swing your baby in front of you, traveling no higher than your shoulders. Control the descent as you immediately go into the next rep.</p>
<p><strong>Baby Russian Twists (10 each side for 20 total twists)</strong><br />
While sitting, hold your baby under its bottom and upper back, or under its arms. Lean back onto your tailbone with legs bent. Engage your core and twist from left to right while holding your baby. Try not to let your feet touch the floor!</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-7101" src="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_205815699.jpeg?resize=1170%2C781&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1170" height="781" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_205815699.jpeg?w=7360&amp;ssl=1 7360w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_205815699.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_205815699.jpeg?resize=768%2C513&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_205815699.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_205815699.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_205815699.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1170px) 100vw, 1170px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Tummy Time Planks (30 seconds without dropping)</strong><br />
On a mat, lay your baby underneath you and come to a forearm plank position. Keep your core tight, quads engaged and back flat &#8211; don’t let your hips sag or rise up. Hold your plank for 30 seconds (or longer if you want) and have a little chit-chat with your infant, or sing a song to help pass the time!</p>
<p><strong>Baby Ab Bicycles (15 cycles. One rep is once you have done each leg)</strong><br />
While sitting, hold your baby under its bottom and upper back, or under its arms. Lean back onto your tailbone with legs bent. Engage your core and cycle those legs while holding your baby straight up in the air.</p>
<p><strong>Tummy Time Plank Ups (10 plank ups. One rep is after you have done each side.)</strong><br />
On a mat, lay your baby underneath you and come to a high plank (push-up) position.<br />
Make sure your hands are directly under your shoulders.<br />
Keep your core tight, quads engaged and back flat &#8211; don’t let your hips sag or rise up.<br />
Lower down to your elbows one at a time. Then one at a time come back up to that high plank position. That is one rep.</p>
<p><strong>Tummy Time Plank Jacks (15 jacks)</strong><br />
On a mat, lay your baby underneath you and come to a high plank position.<br />
Jump your legs wide and then back together, just like a jumping jack motion. If this is too difficult, you can alternate legs, taping each foot out to the side. You can also try performing this in a low plank. Do whatever feels best for you!</p>
<p><strong>Tummy Time Mountain Climbers (15 reps. One rep is after you have done each side)</strong><br />
On a mat, lay your baby underneath you and come to a high plank (push-up) position.<br />
Make sure your hands are directly under your shoulders and weight on just your toes. Engage your core and start “running” &#8211; bringing your knees forward to your chest one at a time.</p>
<p><strong>Baby Tricep Press (15 reps)</strong><br />
Lay flat on your mat. Holding your baby around their waist, put the baby&#8217;s face over your face with your elbows pinned in close to your side. Only flexing your elbows, press your baby toward your thighs, lengthening arms as far as you can comfortably while squeezing your triceps. Reverse the movement back to the starting position.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Toddler Workout Ideas</strong><br />
You will still be able to use a growing toddler for resistance &#8211; your weight will obviously just be a bit heavier.</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-7102" src="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_300141388.jpeg?resize=1170%2C780&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1170" height="780" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_300141388.jpeg?w=5612&amp;ssl=1 5612w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_300141388.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_300141388.jpeg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_300141388.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_300141388.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_300141388.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1170px) 100vw, 1170px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>You can do any of the exercises above; however, you may want to adjust the rep range to be a tad lower since your “weight” will be more substantial.</p>
<p>Once your child is crawling and walking .. getting in a lift WITH them may become more challenging. Their attention span is shorter, so you will want to keep that in mind when selecting your mommy-and-me workout style.</p>
<p>EMOM or timer-based workouts can still work, but since there aren’t any real “breaks” with this style of training, it may be best to stick to standard set and rep style training… in case you need to chase them down between exercises!</p>
<p>As your toddler gets older, you can even make your timer-based sweat sessions a game, where they help you watch the timer or countdown with/for you!</p>
<p><strong>Toddler Backpack Lift</strong><br />
Just as you can with an infant, for any of the EMOM movements above, you can also strap your toddler into a forward or rear-facing backpack carrier and get to work!</p>
<p>If you don’t have that type of carrier for movements like squats, lunges, planks, and pushups, you can ask your toddler to crawl on your back and hold on tight!</p>
<p>Some of the above movements may even be more suitable with a toddler compared to an infant since they can hold their head up on their own.</p>
<p>Here are a few other exercises you can add to the list above that work well with a toddler.</p>
<ul>
<li>Bear Crawls (have them climb on your back or follow along)</li>
<li>Crab Walks (have them mimic you)</li>
<li>Lateral Side Shuffles (have them shadow you and make it a race)</li>
<li>High Knees (an easy one to have them mimic)</li>
<li>Jumping Jacks (another one your kids will love to try)</li>
<li>Box Jumps (give them a small step or just ask them to jump up and down)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Have A Dance Party</strong><br />
Dancing is a fun way to burn a ton of calories! You may have to compromise and turn on Baby Shark instead of Beyonce, but make a playlist full of songs that will keep your kiddos attention for however long you want to break a sweat and JUST DANCE! You don’t have to have any dancing skills. Do anything that keeps you moving and gets your heart rate up!</p>

<p><strong>Stroller Workout</strong><br />
Buy a jogging stroller and get moving! You can keep things simple and just go for a brisk walk or jog. To make things more challenging, you can find hills and push your stroller up them to simulate a treadmill incline walk or hill-sprints. You can also stop every couple of minutes and do some “strolling” lunges, plyometric jumps, strength moves like push-ups, etc.</p>
<p>If you are short on time or just want to make the most out of your walk around the block, try incorporating HIIT intervals into your stroller time.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>Here is an example of a short lower body focused HIIT cardio stroller workout!</strong></em><br />
Start with a brisk 5-minute stroller walk warm-up. Then do every exercise for 45 seconds and rest for 15 seconds before moving on to the next exercise. Once you are finished with the entire circuit, stop for some kisses for about a minute and repeat the circuit one more time!</p>
<ul>
<li>Stroller Push Walking Lunges</li>
<li>Lock &amp; Squat Jump (Stop where you are, lock your stroller and do jump squats)</li>
<li>Stroller Push Run/Sprint</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Water Workout</strong><br />
You obviously won’t be able to swim laps unless you have someone else in the pool supervising with you, but if you have a toddler that loves water, there are numerous exercises you can do with your kiddo that will help you get in a killer workout!</p>
<p>Doing a workout in water adds resistance on it’s own, but you can also add wrist or ankle weights to make your water workout even more challenging!</p>
<p>Hold your toddler for some of these movements, for others, put them in an appropriate floating device and have them next to you while you perform these aquatic style exercises!</p>
<ul>
<li>Water Walk (Hold your baby above your head as you walk for a challenge)</li>
<li>Jumping Jacks</li>
<li>High Knees</li>
<li>Pool Wall Push-Ups</li>
<li>Fast Leg Kick/Flutters</li>
</ul>

<p style="text-align: center;">Once your kids get a little bit older, they will naturally be curious about your workouts.<br />
Use their “monkey-see-monkey-do” stage of life to your advantage!</p>
<p>Pending their age and personality, you can do any of the baby or toddler workouts above.<br />
If they are too heavy, instead of using your kids for weight, use dumbbells or bands and have them exercise with you! You can purchase “kid weights” online, or give them a light canned good, bag of rice, etc.</p>
<p>For things like the sit-ups, and glute-ham raise, you can even ask them to “help mommy” by sitting on your feet!</p>
<p>Just like toddlers, attention spans may be short, so you may want to try Tabata or HIIT style workouts. Anything that gets the job done .. fast!</p>
<p>Other exercises you can do with your 5+ kids:</p>
<ul>
<li>Jump Rope</li>
<li>Mini trampoline/trampoline jumping.</li>
<li>Racing down the length of your yard.</li>
<li>Any “sport” that requires activity &#8211; a game of football, basketball, baseball, or how about some dodgeball!</li>
<li>Yoga</li>
</ul>
<p>When you are finished, have them join you in the kitchen for a kid-friendly <a href="https://sculptnation.com/products/protein" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sculpt Nation Protein</a> smoothie!</p>
<p>You must give your body a fast-acting and easily digestible protein after a workout. You want to avoid going into a catabolic (muscle breakdown) state. If you let your muscles starve after training, that is exactly what you risk!</p>
<p>The quicker you rush quality, highly bioavailable <a href="https://sculptnation.com/products/protein" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PROTEIN</a> into your system post-workout, the faster you’ll increase your lean muscle, burn body fat, improve performance, and build strength.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Dog Mom Workout</strong><br />
Some moms only have kids with four legs and fur. Having a dog is a great way to ensure you get in those daily steps! Take them on several long walks, or if they aren’t too lazy of a breed, get them to jog with you! Just be careful if you live somewhere that it gets hot&#8230; the pavement could burn their little paws!</p>
<p>Pending the size (and personality) of your dog, you can do any of the exercises in our EMOM workout example and use your furry friends for a little resistance!</p>
<p>The biggest challenge you may face (other than an attention span that is likely even shorter than a human toddler) &#8211; is anything on the floor, like yoga!</p>
<p>When you are on “their level” … they will probably confuse YOUR mat time .. to be THEIR play time!</p>
<p>In case you need a smile or want to see some of the exercises above in action .. check out this video of one of our V Shred employees attempting to get in a workout with her 10-pound “fur child” Stella!</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>WHAT IS YOUR DEFINITION OF A MOM?</strong></p>
<p>If you ask Webster, the definition of MOM is: A female parent.</p>
<p>If you ask us, we think the definition of MOM is: One person who does the work of 50. Someone that sacrifices everything without asking for anything in return. The one who you can always count on above everyone else. A cheerleader, counselor, role model, a shoulder to cry on. The one that loves and accepts you no matter what.</p>
