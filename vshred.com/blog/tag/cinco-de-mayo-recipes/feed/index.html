<p><img class="size-full wp-image-7080 aligncenter" src="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/CDM-blog-01-fb-vs.gif?resize=600%2C600&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="600" height="600" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>It is time for the ultimate #TacoTuesday … Cinco de Mayo 2020 is upon us!</p>
<p>If you are on a diet (or just trying not to gain the “Quarantine 15”) … you may think that a fiesta of tacos, tortillas, and tequila is off-limits.</p>
<p>No doubt, many standard Mexican dishes are full of calories, which could easily result in a dieting disaster!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>But you don&#8217;t have to skip the Cinco de Mayo festivities.</strong></em></p>
<p>Without all of the oils, sauces, and cheese, most of the ingredients that make up your favorite Mexican dishes are very waistline-friendly.</p>
<ul>
<li>Lean Meat</li>
<li>Fiber-Rich Beans</li>
<li>Rice</li>
<li>Vegetables</li>
<li>Salsa</li>
<li>Avocado</li>
<li>Herbs and Spices (like cilantro, chile peppers, etc.)</li>
</ul>
<p>The base for most Mexican cuisine is very diet-friendly! Which makes modifying your Cinco de Mayo spread super easy!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>Grab your sombrero…</strong></em><br />
<em><strong>We’ve got a Cinco de Mayo menu that will allow you to</strong></em><br />
<em><strong>enjoy the festivities and stay on track!</strong></em></p>
<p>Before we give you TEN different macro-friendly recipes, here is a Cinco de Mayo FUN FACT for ya … in case you want to impress your fiesta crew!</p>
<p><em><strong>Did you know</strong></em>… Cinco de Mayo (Spanish for “5th of May”) is not a Mexican holiday?<br />
Many people confuse it with Mexican Independence Day (that isn’t until September.)</p>
<p>Cinco de Mayo is actually a day that commemorates the Battle of Puebla when the Mexican army had victory over France during the Franco-Mexican War.</p>
<p>Except for the city of Puebla, where they celebrate with a military parade and mock battle, Cinco celebrations are pretty low-key in Mexico.</p>
<p>Americans, however, use the day as an excuse to eat tacos, bottomless bowls of chips and salsa and pound pitchers of margaritas!</p>
<p>I mean, we aren’t complaining… any excuse for some tacos and tequila, right?</p>
<p>Enough history&#8230; let the fiesta begin!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>HEALTHY CINCO MAIN DISHES</strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>LOW CARB FISH TACO BOWL</strong></span><br />
This bowl reminds us of a sunny day at the beach! It is so flavorful that you won’t even miss the carb-filled tortilla! We are using white fish, but you can substitute grilled chicken, salmon, or shrimp!</p>

<p>There really isn’t a special recipe here (however we are gonna give you one for some inspo.)</p>
<p>All you do is think of what you love in and on a burrito .. and throw it in a bowl instead of wrapping it in a carb-heavy flour tortilla!</p>
<p>With all the flavors and volume, you won’t miss the carbs! Plus, skipping out on rice or a tortilla means you save calories for an extra Skinny Margarita instead (recipe for that is below.)</p>
<p>Get creative and use your favorite lean protein, veggies, and garnishes!<br />
Here is how we like to make our bowl ….</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Bowl Ingredients:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Lean meat of choice (grilled chicken, lean shredded pork, lean steak, fish, shrimp, etc.)</li>
<li>Lots of shredded lettuce</li>
<li>Steamed cilantro lime rice, cauliflower rice, or quinoa.</li>
<li>Sauteed Fajita Veggies</li>
<li>Fajita Seasoning</li>
<li>Black Beans</li>
<li>Corn</li>
<li>Salsa</li>
<li>Pico</li>
<li>Guac</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Bowl Instructions:</span></p>
<p>Make your meat however you choose using seasonings that compliment Mexican fare!<br />
We are using a lean sirloin steak rubbed with a cilantro lime seasoning.</p>
<p>Make your steamed rice, cauli rice, or quinoa (add lime, cilantro, and salt for extra flavor.)</p>
<p>Sautee Veggies (we are using olive oil cooking spray, peppers, onions, and mushrooms)</p>
<p>Crack open a can of corn and black beans and heat them up on the stove or microwave.</p>
<p>Put a ton of shredded lettuce in a big bowl. Mix in some salsa, lime juice, and seasoning to give your lettuce a little extra flavor. Pile in all your ingredients. Mix up. Top with garnishes of choice…. dig in!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>SOUTHWEST CHICKEN QUESADILLAS</strong></span><br />
Typically we would tell you that a quesadilla should be a hard pass. At a restaurant, this carb-heavy menu staple is fried in oil and filled with hundreds of calories of cheese, with very little (and sometimes no) protein and veggies. But it is easy to give this typically high-calorie Mexican staple a healthy upgrade at home!</p>

<p>*Recipe makes 4 quesadillas*</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Ingredients:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>10 oz Raw Chicken Breast</li>
<li>4 small multi-grain tortillas, corn tortillas, or low carb wraps</li>
<li>¼ cup hummus of choice (we like red pepper, jalapeno, etc.)</li>
<li>½ cup chopped red onion</li>
<li>½ cup black beans</li>
<li>2 tbsp minced garlic</li>
<li>4 tbsp goat cheese</li>
<li>1 small sliced avocado</li>
<li>Fresh cilantro</li>
<li>Salsa or Pico</li>
<li>Coconut oil spray</li>
</ul>
<p>*optional for added protein and dipping*<br />
FF Greek Yogurt (great substitute for sour cream)</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Instructions:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>Spray a non-stick skillet with spray and heat on medium-high</li>
<li>Saute 1 tbsp minced garlic and onions. Add chicken (thinly sliced) and cook about 12-15 minutes or until fully cooked.</li>
<li>Spread hummus onto each of your tortillas.</li>
<li>On one side of your tortillas &#8211; evenly distribute your cooked chicken mixture, black beans, goat cheese, sliced avocado, and some fresh chopped cilantro.</li>
<li>Fold tortillas in half.</li>
<li>Spray skillet with oil and allow skillet to heat to medium heat.</li>
<li>Add quesadillas and cook (one at a time or however much space you have in the pan) for about 2 minutes per side.</li>
<li>Press down w/spatula, so they flatten out.</li>
</ol>
<p>Top with salsa and dip in greek yogurt!</p>
<p><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">** TIP **</span></em><br />
If you don’t like plain greek yogurt, try mixing in some lime juice, taco seasonings, smashed avocado, or even some low sugar ketchup (yes ketchup, don’t knock it till you try it.)</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>HEALTHY CINCO SIDE DISHES</strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>HEALTH(IER) CHIPS AND GUAC</strong></span></p>
<p><a href="https://vshred.com/sp/survey/survey-aka1/"><img class="alignnone wp-image-7067 size-full" src="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_265811963.jpeg?resize=1170%2C781&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1170" height="781" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_265811963.jpeg?w=4800&amp;ssl=1 4800w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_265811963.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_265811963.jpeg?resize=768%2C513&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_265811963.jpeg?resize=1024%2C684&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_265811963.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_265811963.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1170px) 100vw, 1170px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>One of the quickest ways to eat a TON of calories in no time&#8230; is with chips and dips!</p>
<p>For “chips” … there are lots of baked versions you can purchase. But if you want to make your own tortilla chips, it is super simple!</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Tortilla Chip Ingredients:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Corn tortillas</li>
<li>Olive or Avocado Oil Spray (or a tiny bit of the actual oil)</li>
<li>Salt</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Tortilla Chip Instructions:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Heat oven to 350 degrees.</li>
<li>Cut corn tortillas into triangles.</li>
<li>Spray or lightly brush with oil.</li>
<li>Sprinkle on some salt.</li>
<li>Place on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper and bake about 10 minutes, or until crispy!</li>
</ul>
<p><em><strong>If you want to save some carbs, a great alternative to chips would be fresh veggies, like peppers, celery, and zucchini!</strong></em></p>
<p>For “dips”… salsa is always a safe choice, especially if you make your own at home.</p>
<p>Guacamole is another popular choice. While guac is made with healthy avocados, it is easy to overeat this delicious chip dipper!</p>
<p>But with a simple recipe trick, you can easily add “bulk” to your guacamole so you can<br />
enjoy more&#8230; for less!</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Skinny Guacamole Ingredients:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>1 large ripe avocado</li>
<li>1/4 cup coarsely chopped fresh cilantro</li>
<li>1/4 cup finely chopped onion</li>
<li>2 cloves garlic</li>
<li>2 tablespoons lime juice</li>
<li>1/2 teaspoon hot sauce</li>
<li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
<li>1 large zucchini cut into chunks OR 1 cup steamed peas</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Skinny Guacamole Instructions:</span></p>
<p>(zucchini version)</p>
<ul>
<li>Place the chopped zucchini in a microwave-safe bowl and cover with a damp paper towel. Microwave on high until tender (3-5 minutes.)</li>
<li>Drain any liquid by pressing lightly on the zucchini.</li>
<li>Let cool for about 5 minutes.</li>
<li>Add avocado, cilantro, onion, garlic, lime juice, hot sauce, and salt. Mash with a fork until combined.</li>
</ul>
<p>(pea version) *using peas will make the guac slightly sweeter*</p>
<ul>
<li>Lightly steam peas. Allow to cool and then mash by hand or place in a food processor and pulse until the peas are smooth.</li>
<li>Transfer peas into a large bowl and add the rest of the guacamole ingredients above, minus the zucchini (Adding both could work too. More veggies is never a bad thing.)</li>
<li>Mix well, mashing the avocado as you stir.</li>
</ul>

<p>Also known as Elote, this delicious corn dish was given the nickname “Mexican Street Corn” because it is a staple for street vendors in Mexico.</p>
<p>You can get fancy and make/serve it on a stick like they do .. or skip the stick .. and place it straight on the grill. If you don’t have a grill, you can also make the corn in the oven.<br />
Can’t find corn on the cob? Use canned or frozen corn, mix in the other ingredients, and serve it off the cob!</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Ingredients:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>4 medium corn on the cob (husked and silk removed)</li>
<li>¼ cup light or fat free mayonnaise</li>
<li>¼ cup fresh chopped cilantro</li>
<li>2 tbsp plain fat free greek yogurt</li>
<li>1 tsp fresh lime juice</li>
<li>1 tsp</li>
<li>½ tsp ancho chile powder</li>
<li>¼ tsp minced garlic</li>
<li>4 Tbsp cotija cheese (Can sub crumbled fat free feta for an even healthier version, see notes)</li>
<li>Olive oil cooking spray</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Instructions</span></p>
<ol>
<li>Preheat grill to medium.</li>
<li>Lightly spray corn with cooking spray.</li>
<li>Place corn on the grill, turning occasionally.</li>
<li>Cook until tender and slightly charred (10-15 minutes.)</li>
<li>While the corn is on the grill, combine all ingredients except the cheese in a small bowl.</li>
<li>When corn is ready, brush with the mixture and then sprinkle each ear with 1 Tbsp cheese. Add a few more shakes of chili powder for an extra kick!</li>
</ol>
<p>*While they both have a similar texture and mild salty flavor, feta cheese will not taste the same as cotija. Because feta is easy to find and comes in a fat free variety, it is a decent substitute that could serve as a lower-calorie option. Grated parmesan cheese could also be a substitute.</p>

<p>Mexican sangria is a traditional Spanish beverage that combines wine, fruit, sugar, and some spices. It is known to have a slightly higher alcohol content than Spanish sangria and pairs well with spicy foods!</p>
<p>We are gonna go a MUCH healthier route with a sangria “mocktail” that contains <a href="https://sculptnation.com/products/bcaas" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BCAAs</a>, making it a perfect post-workout treat! Because we know you are gonna get in a sweat session before your fiesta, right?</p>
<p>Ingredients:<br />
1 scoop <a href="https://sculptnation.com/products/bcaas" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sculpt Nation Fruit Punch BCAAs</a><br />
1 cup fruit of choice (examples: sliced blood oranges, sliced peaches, raspberries, strawberries, blueberries, etc. We love the combo of oranges, peaches, and strawberries.)<br />
4 oz diet ginger ale<br />
8 oz water</p>
<p>Instructions:<br />
Add water, a scoop of <a href="https://sculptnation.com/products/bcaas" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sculpt Nation BCAAs</a>, fruit, and ginger ale (in this order) to a shaker cup. Shake up and serve chilled!</p>
<p><em><strong>Why BCAAs?</strong></em><br />
For starters, they are delicious and add flavor to your drink for no added calories (you can’t say the same with typical fruit juices or sangria mixes.)</p>
<p>But they can also provide tons of recovery benefits! So if you take us up on our Cinco Tips (below) and get in a good training session before your fiesta… <em><strong>this Sangria recipe would be a great post-workout drink!</strong></em></p>
<p><a href="https://sculptnation.com/products/bcaas" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BCAAs</a> (or branched-chain amino acids) assist in helping you recover from your training sessions much faster. They provide exactly what your body needs to support getting into an anabolic state (muscle building and fat burning) &#8211; and help repair the damage training causes to your muscle fibers. <em><strong>Quicker recovery means&#8230; less muscle soreness!</strong></em></p>
<p>Faster recovery is only one perk of supplementing with <a href="https://sculptnation.com/products/bcaas" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">quality BCAAs</a>. The essential amino acids in our <a href="https://sculptnation.com/products/bcaas" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sculpt Nation blend</a> have been shown to assist with and support&#8230;</p>
<ul>
<li>Adding Lean Muscle</li>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>If none of these recipes entice your taste buds… there are plenty of healthy swaps you can make that will allow you to stick to your diet…</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>Here are some tips!</strong></em></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>ENJOY</strong></span><br />
<strong>Fresh Veggies</strong>: No limit here! Veggies are a great way to add “bulk” to your Cinco dishes. Just don’t cook them in a ton of oil. Steam or saute with cooking spray!</p>
<p><strong>Lean Meats</strong>: grilled chicken, white fish, shrimp, and even lean shredded pork loin! Load up on lean protein.</p>
<p><strong>Salsa</strong>: This condiment adds tons of flavor to your food and is very low in calories and carbs.<br />
If you are watching sodium, many store-bought salsas are super high in sodium! You can always make you own!</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">LIMIT</span></strong><br />
<strong>Tortillas</strong>: Opt for “thin” or mini street size tortillas. Another option is to mix things up. Have 1-2 tortillas, and for the rest of your tacos, use a lettuce wrap instead!</p>
<p><strong>Rice</strong>: Nothing wrong with rice! Just be mindful. This small grain can add up to some significant carbs! Also, pass on rice cooked in oil and use steamed rice flavored with things like lime juice and cilantro! If you want to add bulk to your rice, do a 50/50 mix of rice and cauli rice!</p>
<p><strong>Guacamole</strong>: Avocados are very healthy! But it can be easy to eat a full day’s worth of fat in one sitting of chips &amp; guac if you aren&#8217;t careful! Remember that even “healthy” foods have calories! If you want more “bulk,” try our lower fat guac recipe above.</p>
<p><strong>Fruit Based Salsa</strong>: This is another example of how healthy foods still have calories. There is nothing wrong with fruit, but keep in mind fruit based salsas do have more carbs.</p>
<p><strong>Low-Fat Cheese</strong>: The same rule applies here! Just be mindful! A sprinkle can go a long way in adding flavor to your dishes!</p>
<p><strong>Beans</strong>: This is another super healthy food that we encourage you to add to your dishes! Just keep in mind that beans do have a decent amount of both protein and fat and not ALL beans are healthy (skip the refried.)</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>PASS</strong></span><br />
<strong>Full Fat Cheese</strong>: Things like queso dip, etc.</p>
<p><strong>Anything Fried</strong>: Eat black beans instead of refried beans. Baked chips instead of fried chips. Soft flour or corn tortillas instead of crispy taco shells.</p>
<p><strong>Fattier Cuts Of Meat</strong>: Many Mexican restaurants use fatty cuts of beef, chicken thighs instead of breast, and pork shoulder instead of a leaner loin. Make sure you are using lean cuts of meat for your dishes.</p>
<p><strong>Sugary Pre-Mixed Drinks</strong>: Of course, alcohol has calories, but so do the sugary mixes you use to make your favorite margarita! Skip the pre-made mixes, or things like triple sec, and make your own using our recipe above. You should use caution with alcohol in general. It’s not just the “empty” calories in the drinks themselves, it’s also the temptation to make bad decisions after a few drinks kick in!</p>
<p><strong>OTHER TIPS</strong><br />
If you are going to support your local Mexican restaurant, when you order, you can make a few special requests to make your meal healthier!</p>
<p>Ask them to steam your vegetables, use light or no oil when cooking, pass on the cheese and refried beans, get ALL sauces on the side and use them in moderation, ask for lettuce wraps instead of tortillas, skip their rice (unless it’s steamed) and add your own at home, and instead of having them include their fried tortilla chips .. make your own using our recipe above.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Healthy or Modified…</em></strong><br />
<em>Make sure you put those calories to good use and get in a pre-Cinco lift!!</em><br />
<em>If you need some ideas, we have hundreds (for free) on our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/vshred" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">YouTube channel</a>!</em></p>
<p>If you decide to indulge and eat some non-modified fiesta foods, here are a few more ways you can lessen the “damage” from all the extra calories you consume!</p>
<ul>
<li>Plan your fiesta to be a “High Carb Day” &#8211; “Free Meal” &#8211; “ReFeed Day” &#8211; etc.</li>
<li>Plan your training split so that you work one of your lagging/larger body parts and get in a solid lift and cardio session before you indulge!</li>
<li>Go on a pre and post-meal walk to increase your daily <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12468415" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NEAT</a>.</li>
<li>Include a fat-burning thermogenic support supplement like <a href="https://sculptnation.com/products/burn">Sculpt Nation BURN</a> that helps naturally suppress appetite!</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://sculptnation.com/products/burn" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BURN</a> is different from many “fat burners” on the market. It’s so unique, we don’t even like to call it that. Most fat burners may help you burn a few extra calories, but it ends there. Any fat that is mobilized may still be in your blood waiting for a new place to live (like your stomach or thighs.)</p>
<p><a href="https://sculptnation.com/products/burn" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BURN</a> goes further .. it attacks your body fat from three essential pathways.. blasting fat cells from the inside out.</p>
<p>Even if you are choosing to lighten up your fiesta, <a href="https://sculptnation.com/products/burn" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BURN</a> is a great addition to your supplement stack because it goes beyond helping you burn calories. It helps support and raise your metabolic rate! Increasing your metabolic rate helps boost your body’s ability to burn fat for fuel!</p>
