<p>It is that time of year!! 4th of July is upon us!!</p>
<p>Burgers on the grill … fireworks in the sky … and for many .. an excuse to skip the gym and eat thousands of calories .. in one sitting!</p>
<p>It can be tempting to throw your diet and training mindset out the window when holidays come around. But you must treat holidays just like you would any other day.</p>
<p>Have fun .. enjoy the time with family … and even enjoy all the food .. but keep your goals in mind. One of the best things you can do .. is still get in a solid workout!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>We’ve got the perfect 4th of July PRE PARTY PUMP!</strong></em></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-7322" src="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_8006.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_8006.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_8006.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_8006.jpeg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_8006.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>The workout we&#8217;re giving you below will not only burn a ton of calories .. the endorphins released from this short HIIT workout will boost your mood .. which will help you keep your healthy food habits in mind when it’s time to fire up the grill!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>We will never tell you that you need to “earn” your calories .. that is not the kind of relationship with food we promote here at V Shred &amp; Sculpt Nation.</strong></em></p>
<p>Food should never be seen as “the enemy” or “a reward” .. and exercise should never be viewed as punishment.</p>
<p>Diet culture makes us feel bad about having a nice dinner with friends, and it makes us fall into the mind trap that holidays will make us gain weight.</p>
<p><em><strong>What happens next?</strong></em></p>
<p><img class="size-large wp-image-7158" src="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_215638387.jpeg?resize=1024%2C684&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="684" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_215638387.jpeg?resize=1024%2C684&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_215638387.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_215638387.jpeg?resize=768%2C513&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_215638387.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_215638387.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>We feel guilt .. and view exercise as “punishment” we “have” to get up and do the next day .. or as justification that if we burn a ton of calories pre-feast .. it’s okay to eat that extra serving of ice cream or calorie-filled cocktail.</p>
<p>Once you get this mentality, you will begin an endless (and very unhealthy) relationship with food. You will start to believe you ALWAYS have to earn food .. and will only feel okay about enjoying yourself .. if you have exercised.</p>
<p>Instead, look at your patriotic pump as a FREEDOM that you are blessed to have! You have an able body that GETS to move!!!</p>
<p>And view all that 4th of July food as FUEL! Getting in a workout before a big meal is a great way to rev up your metabolism and prepare your body to USE (instead of store) any extra calories you may consume!</p>
<p>Don’t fall into this food guilt trap<em>..</em>But also don’t go to the totally opposite end of the spectrum and make the holidays an excuse to be lazy and throw all your food mindfulness out the window! Use the short 15-minute workout  below and then ENJOY your day!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>Alright .. let’s get our PATRIOTIC PUMP ON!!</strong></em></p>
<p>Here is a quick fat blasting FOLLOW-ALONG cardio workout that won’t interfere with your day full of fun with friends and family!</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='1170' height='659' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/HzkBonK4kPQ?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The video above is a FOLLOW ALONG! Just press play and get to work! This fat-blasting workout consists of only 5 exercises. You will do each exercise for 40 seconds and take a quick 20-second break before moving on to the next exercise.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Explosive Squat with Calf Raises &#8211; 40 Seconds</strong><br />
<strong>Speed Skaters &#8211; 40 Seconds</strong><br />
<strong>High Knees &#8211; 40 Seconds</strong><br />
<strong>Alternating Toe Taps &#8211; 40 Seconds</strong><br />

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>New Research: The Most Promising Fat Loss Support Discovery We’ve Ever Seen</strong></em></p>
<p><a href="http://www.sculptnation.com/turmeric-lp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-7029 size-full" src="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_216416516.jpeg?resize=1170%2C741&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1170" height="741" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_216416516.jpeg?w=5760&amp;ssl=1 5760w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_216416516.jpeg?resize=300%2C190&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_216416516.jpeg?resize=768%2C486&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_216416516.jpeg?resize=1024%2C649&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_216416516.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_216416516.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1170px) 100vw, 1170px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>What if someone told you the reason you haven’t seen results, no matter what diet or training plan you follow, isn&#8217;t your fault?</p>
<p>What if there was a “biological hack” that could finally allow you to unleash and promote your full fat-blasting potential?</p>
<p>If researchers from places like Cambridge and Harvard are correct … there is!!</p>
<p><em><strong>The struggle is real&#8230;</strong></em><br />
Trying to re-shape your body by building lean muscle and losing body fat takes time and consistency.</p>
<p><em><strong>We all know that there is not a quick way to go about this.</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>But for some…</strong></em><br />
It doesn’t matter how hard they push, how many hours of cardio they log, or how many calories they restrict &#8211; the changes just don’t seem to happen. Or if they do &#8211; they are painfully slow.</p>
<p><em><strong>If this is you or someone you know…</strong></em> the information in this article could be life-changing!</p>
<p>Some of the top researchers from around the world wanted to find out why some people can’t lose weight no matter what or how hard they try.</p>
<p><em><strong>They made A MAJOR FAT BURNING DISCOVERY!!</strong></em></p>
<p>What we are sharing with you is something even those that don’t struggle with weight issues need to know because&#8230; <em><strong>the culprit is something we all have circulating through our bodies… waiting to attack our fat cells.</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>The reason every diet you have ever tried has failed could be something </strong></em><em><strong>in YOUR BLOOD.</strong></em></p>

<p>We are NOT talking about genetics.</p>
<p>The genes your parents gave you and your body type aren’t all that matter.<br />
Anyone can have too much of this circulating through their blood.</p>
<p><em><strong>The blame could be because of excess protein.</strong></em></p>
<p>Not the kind you eat. This is a protein that is flowing throughout your body right now even as you read this article, and<em><strong> its job is to BLOCK YOU FROM LOSING WEIGHT!</strong></em></p>
<p>No matter what type of lifestyle change you make&#8230; if you have too much of this protein in your blood&#8230; you could still struggle to lose fat.</p>
<p><em><strong>WHAT IS THIS FAT BLOCKING PROTEIN?!</strong></em><br />
It has a scientific name, but we are just going to call it <strong>THE FAT PROTEIN</strong> &#8211; because that is exactly what it does.<em><strong> It slows down your metabolism and sabotages your efforts to lose weight.</strong></em></p>
<p>These proteins attach themselves to your fat cells and virtually force your body to hold on to fat for dear life! They stop your metabolism from generating the kind of heat it needs to burn fat.</p>
<p>Scientists discovered that people that are overweight have MORE of this protein in their bloodstream.</p>
<p>But why? And what can you do about it?<br />
Keep reading!!</p>
<p><em><strong>HOW TO STOP YOUR BODY FROM MAKING “THE FAT PROTEIN”&#8230;</strong></em><br />
You need MORE FAT!</p>

<p>Hold up .. we aren’t talking about the kind of body fat you want to get rid of.<br />
We also aren’t referring to “healthy fats” you should eat.</p>
<p>You have TWO types of FAT CELLS in your body, and both play a role in your metabolism.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>White Fat</strong>: This is bad fat. It is responsible for storing excess fat to be later used for energy.</li>
<li><strong>Brown Fat</strong>: This is good fat. It creates heat in your body and revs up your fat-burning metabolism.</li>
</ul>
<p>Researchers found that this fat protein is only made by your WHITE (bad) fat cells.</p>
<p>If this is true, then logic would tell us that you can help tackle this by making LESS white fat and MORE brown fat, right?</p>
<p>How in the world can you do that? Is it even possible? YES!!</p>
<p><em><strong>HOW TO SUPPORT MAKING MORE METABOLISM BOOSTING BROWN FAT&#8230;</strong></em><br />
There are THREE things that researchers have found to help increase the amount of BROWN (good) fat cells that you have.</p>
<p>Unless you like being cold and hungry, you aren’t going to like the first two… they are extreme.</p>
<p>The third method is fast and easy. Researchers found that you can help support and restart your fat-loss engine <em><strong>with a single nutrient.</strong></em></p>
<p>There is an herb that has the potential to promote the conversion of unhealthy white fat cells into fat-burning, thermogenic, brown fat cells.</p>
