<p>It is officially (unofficial) .. <em><strong>summer is here!!</strong></em></p>
<p>Memorial Day marks the unofficial start of summer, and I don’t know about you, but I’m excited to take some of my workouts outside!</p>
<p>Today we’ve got a full-body workout that you can do from your backyard or wherever your Memorial Day weekend takes you!</p>
<p>It doesn’t require any equipment. We are using bodyweight only, and it can be adjusted to any fitness level!</p>
<p>Of course, you can do this working indoors if you choose, but as long as you are hydrated, try breaking a sweat outside!</p>
<p>Taking your workouts outdoors has a ton of benefits .. here are a few!</p>
<p><strong>3 BENEFITS OF EXERCISING OUTSIDE</strong></p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-7153" src="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_222896530.jpeg?resize=1170%2C780&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1170" height="780" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_222896530.jpeg?w=5040&amp;ssl=1 5040w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_222896530.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_222896530.jpeg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_222896530.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_222896530.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_222896530.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1170px) 100vw, 1170px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><strong>1: You May Burn More Calories</strong><br />
Some small studies found outdoor exercisers burn a few more calories than those who exercise indoors. The theory is that exercising outdoors exerts more energy.</p>
<p>Be careful.. this could have the opposite effect if you are attempting to workout when temperatures are extreme.</p>
<p>Working out when it’s too hot could affect your endurance. You may also be more tempted to shorten the duration of your workout.</p>
<p>Try doing your outdoor workouts early in the morning before temperatures spike, or later in the evening.</p>
<p>Always stay extra hydrated and above all.. listen to your body!</p>
<p><strong>2: It Could Cheer You Up</strong><br />
Hundreds of studies have shown that soaking up the sun and being surrounded by mother nature helps alleviate stress and improve overall mood!</p>
<p>Exercising outdoors has even been shown to enhance your brain! Researchers say this is because being outside stimulates all five senses at once &#8211; something that can’t be achieved inside a gym or your living room.</p>
<p>Head outside .. breathe in some fresh air .. take a moment to appreciate the beauty around you! Maybe even take off your headphones and listen to the sounds of nature!</p>
<p>A little natural Vitamin D is no doubt a great motivator to get moving!</p>
<p><strong>3: It Saves You Money</strong><br />
Gym memberships are not cheap. Not to mention, they often go unused.</p>
<p>How many times have you paid for a year and only showed up once or twice a week, or even worse, gone months without entering a building that you pay to use?</p>
<p>If you can go every day, a gym membership is no doubt worth the money. But despite what most believe, it’s not required to get in a solid training session.</p>
<p>That is why we focus on so many home workouts on our <strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/vshred" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">YouTube Channel</a></strong>, and why we recently created an entire program called <a href="https://vshred.com/sp/move/soc-all" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MOVE</a> that can be done from home. You can check that out <a href="https://vshred.com/sp/move/soc-all" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>HERE</strong></a> if you are interested!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>ALRIGHT… let’s break a sweat!</strong></em></p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-7154" src="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_212104629.jpeg?resize=1170%2C780&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1170" height="780" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_212104629.jpeg?w=5760&amp;ssl=1 5760w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_212104629.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_212104629.jpeg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_212104629.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_212104629.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_212104629.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1170px) 100vw, 1170px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
