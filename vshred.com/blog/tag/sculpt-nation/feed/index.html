<p>When exercise becomes a convenient habit, transformations become possible. In August 2019, Deborah, 40, of Inez, TX came back to work after a week off due to nerve damage in her back. The other waitresses in the restaurant where she worked had started a small weight loss challenge. The winner amongst them would get the prize pool from each person’s $5 buy in plus a gift card for matching that total. It wasn’t much, but Deborah figured what the heck…and now her V Shred transformation is inspiring others!</p>
<p><em>“I put money in and signed up, but I was convinced I wouldn’t lose weight so I just kept doing what I normally did.”</em> she explained.</p>
<p>After a couple weeks, as some of the other waitresses started to lose a few initial pounds Deborah saw a photo of herself and did not like what was looking back at her.</p>
<p><em>“Man was it an eye opener.”</em></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-7636" src="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Deb-before-blog.png?resize=1024%2C1024&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="1024" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Deb-before-blog.png?resize=1024%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Deb-before-blog.png?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 150w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Deb-before-blog.png?resize=300%2C300&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Deb-before-blog.png?resize=768%2C768&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Deb-before-blog.png?resize=60%2C60&amp;ssl=1 60w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Deb-before-blog.png?w=1080&amp;ssl=1 1080w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>The very next day she signed up for a gym membership with a friend. As they both consistently went to the gym after dropping the kids off at school at eating healthier, she started to notice results.</p>
<p><em>“Within a month I lost 9 pounds! With the busy schedules of kids and work I didn’t want to be stressed about work outs and food.”</em></p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Finding Fat Loss Extreme for Women &#8211; Starting A V Shred Transformation</h2>
<p>It was a good start, but as a busy working mother of 3, Deborah knew she needed something more straightforward and structured.</p>
<p><em>“I needed someone to tell me what workouts to do on what days, how many reps, when to rest, and FOR SURE what to eat. Counting macros was not in the cards for me and didn’t have to be. With V Shred its all done for me and works. I love all of it!!”</em> she described, looking back on her V Shred transformation.</p>
<p>Deborah first got started with the <a href="https://vshred.com/sp/fat-loss-extreme-f/sku_CKcwR4TEg54IeG?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=socialmedia&amp;utm_campaign=female-motivation-testimonial&amp;utm_content=Product-Author&amp;utm_term=5">Fat Loss Extreme for Her</a> program. Once she completed the initial 90 days she switched to the <a href="https://vshred.com/sp/ripped-in-90-days/sku_AR6nTj3PTK3uu9?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=socialmedia&amp;utm_campaign=female-motivation-testimonial&amp;utm_content=Product-Author&amp;utm_term=5">Ripped In 90 Days</a> program, and now does a regular combination of the two.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-7629" src="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/before-after-f-sc-225.jpg?resize=1024%2C1024&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="1024" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/before-after-f-sc-225.jpg?resize=1024%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/before-after-f-sc-225.jpg?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 150w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/before-after-f-sc-225.jpg?resize=300%2C300&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/before-after-f-sc-225.jpg?resize=768%2C768&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/before-after-f-sc-225.jpg?resize=60%2C60&amp;ssl=1 60w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/before-after-f-sc-225.jpg?w=1080&amp;ssl=1 1080w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><em>“I was never involved in working out or eating healthy ever.”</em> Deborah explained. <em>“After starting V Shred my body was constantly changing for the better and I now see muscles I didn’t know I had! I keep going then pushing harder.”</em></p>
<p>Throughout 2020 Deborah was able to continue her exercises at the gym, despite COVID closures in other parts of Texas. Her success inspired her to close in a patio at home, and like many, create her own home gym.</p>
<p><em>“It has everything I need except a stair stepper and a couple of leg machines.”</em></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-7630" src="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/ezgif-2-f58715b67360.gif?resize=1080%2C410&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1080" height="410" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><em>“With the home gym and all of V Shred’s programs, I have plenty to do. I also purchased <a href="https://vshred.com/sp/move?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=socialmedia&amp;utm_campaign=female-motivation-testimonial&amp;utm_content=Product-Author&amp;utm_term=5">V Shred&#8217;s MOVE Program</a> during quarantine! As far as nutrition, I kept making my meal plans [with my V Shred Trainer] and sticking with the diet. We have a garden to grow our own vegetables, have 10 chickens for fresh eggs, and a pond stocked with catfish and perch which are just now getting big enough to eat.”</em></p>
<p>Once her weight loss results were noticeable from diet and exercise alone Deborah started implementing SculptNation supplements to gain that extra edge on her already active day to day life.</p>
<p><em>“When Sculpt Nation has their <a href="https://sculptnation.com/products/fat-loss-stack?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=socialmedia&amp;utm_campaign=female-motivation-testimonial&amp;utm_content=Product-Author&amp;utm_term=5">40% off sales</a> I stock up 3-6 months in advance… My closet is kind of like a supplement store.”</em> Deborah mused.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-7631" src="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/117831867_592673508072569_7785970253332491242_n.jpg?resize=1024%2C768&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="768" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/117831867_592673508072569_7785970253332491242_n.jpg?resize=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/117831867_592673508072569_7785970253332491242_n.jpg?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/117831867_592673508072569_7785970253332491242_n.jpg?resize=768%2C576&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/117831867_592673508072569_7785970253332491242_n.jpg?w=1242&amp;ssl=1 1242w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">A True V Shred Transformation &#8211; From Tired &amp; Injured to Proud &amp; Self-Sufficient</h2>
<p>From the support Deborah received from family and friends, she also had a bit of a wakeup call. Well past the initial challenge with coworkers, others were noticing her body composition change, her improved attitude, and her enthusiasm for helping others. As people started asking her questions, she knew helping others transform into happy and proud versions of themselves (like she had) was something she wanted to do.</p>
<p><em>“My mom saw my weight loss and started training with me. She got down 30 pounds in 3 months! My 4 year old wants to eat what I eat so he can have muscles. My 13 year old loves going to the gym with me. My husband constantly tells me how proud of me he is. They’ve all supported me 100%!”</em></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-7633" src="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Deb-progress2.png?resize=1024%2C1024&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="1024" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Deb-progress2.png?resize=1024%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Deb-progress2.png?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 150w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Deb-progress2.png?resize=300%2C300&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Deb-progress2.png?resize=768%2C768&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Deb-progress2.png?resize=60%2C60&amp;ssl=1 60w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>Now Deborah is returning the favor!</p>
<p><em>“Now that I have been on this journey I know that I absolutely want to help people to hit their personal goals and feel happy and proud of themselves inside and out.”</em></p>
<p>Deborah has enrolled in the ACE personal training certification program. At age 40 with new goals and dreams she’s working to become certified as a trainer, nutritionist, and youth fitness coach to help kids get on the right track early, as she now has been able to help her family do.</p>
<p>This fall Deborah competed in an online competition to be featured on <a href="https://mshealthandfitness.com/2020/deborah-mcdaniel?utm_source=vshred-blog&amp;utm_medium=socialmedia&amp;utm_campaign=female-motivation-testimonial&amp;utm_content=Product-Author&amp;utm_term=5">Ms Health And Fitness</a> and finished in the top 10!</p>
<h2>Giving Back Fitness Motivation</h2>
<p>When Deborah was asked about how community plays a part in a fitness journey and her personal V Shred transformation she mentioned her success was all about the support she received. Motivating loved ones, professional guidance, and a community of like minded individuals help make personal transformations possible.</p>
<p><em>“My experience with Vshred has been life changing. When it comes to my fitness journey I am proud that I stuck to it even when I didn’t want to. The Vshred for women Facebook page is amazing, all the support and transformation are awesome!”</em></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-7568" src="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/43707f0c562bc5957a2488cd1a9fd5322a9e2de0.jpg?resize=1024%2C768&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="768" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/43707f0c562bc5957a2488cd1a9fd5322a9e2de0.jpg?resize=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/43707f0c562bc5957a2488cd1a9fd5322a9e2de0.jpg?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/43707f0c562bc5957a2488cd1a9fd5322a9e2de0.jpg?resize=768%2C576&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/43707f0c562bc5957a2488cd1a9fd5322a9e2de0.jpg?w=1440&amp;ssl=1 1440w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><em>“I never even thought of going to the gym and eating healthy, but now want to help others do it. If V Shred wouldn’t have been such an amazing program I probably would have stopped a long time ago!”</em></p>
<p>The V Shred Team is so proud of Deborah’s journey and cannot wait to see her help others build active and healthy lifestyles. Her’s is a unique, and lifelong journey. Shred on!</p>

<p><strong>RECIPE 1: CAULIFLOWER BUNS</strong><br />
*Servings will vary pending the size you want to make your buns*</p>
<p>Using cauliflower instead of bread may sound unappealing, but with the right recipe, you won’t notice the cauliflower taste. You will only be left with hundreds of calories that you can use somewhere else (like on our healthy protein apple pie or sugar free jello shots.)</p>
<p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>1 (12 oz) bag cauliflower rice</li>
<li>1 egg white</li>
<li>1 tbsp coconut flour</li>
<li>1/4 tsp salt</li>
<li>1-1/2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
<li>1 tsp each of any other seasonings you want your bun to taste like!</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Directions:</strong><br />
Steam the cauliflower according to the package; drain until ALL WATER IS REMOVED (this is key) and let cool. You may want to use a cheesecloth or dry paper towels to make sure ALL water is removed.</p>
<p>Whisk together the coconut flour, baking powder, seasonings, add the cauliflower mixture, and egg white. Stirring until blended. If the batter is too dry, try adding teaspoons of unsweetened nut milk, or even water, to reach desired consistency.</p>
<p>There are several methods you can use to make your buns! Here are a few!</p>
<p><em><strong>Muffin Tins</strong></em><br />
Distribute evenly into muffin tins. Bake in the preheated oven for 40 to 45 minutes until golden brown at edges and centers feel set when lightly touched. Transfer to a cooling rack and let cool completely before removing. Slice them in half and serve up!</p>
<p><em><strong>QUICK TIP</strong></em> … You can also use this batter and pour it directly into a small sprayed skillet .. in a mini-waffle or pancake maker .. or even in the microwave!!</p>
<p><em><strong>For the microwave version&#8230;</strong> </em><br />
Pour a couple of inches of batter into a deep coffee mug. The larger it is, the better, unless you are eating a tiny patty of meat. Microwave time will vary, but zap it about 45 seconds and see if it’s ready. If not, keep adding 10 seconds at a time until done!</p>
<p>Don’t overcook, or it will be too dry. Dump out of the mug .. let cool .. cut in half …. Enjoy!</p>
<p><em><strong>TIP</strong></em> .. if they still don’t seem “toasted” enough. You can always throw them on the grill, put them in a toaster oven, or even an air-fryer!</p>

<p><strong>RECIPE 2: FIRECRACKER GRILLED SALMON</strong><br />
You may not think of salmon as being a 4th of July staple, but eating this super healthy fish on Independence Day .. is a tradition in New England!</p>
<p>According to history buffs, it started by coincidence. During the mid-summer months, salmon was plentiful in that region. Because it was “in season” &#8211; it always ended up on the dinner table for Independence Day! Even though salmon is available year-round now, the holiday tradition of eating salmon on the 4th remains to be a big deal there!</p>
<p>If you want to celebrate like the New Englanders .. this grilled salmon recipe is tasty, tangy, and packs just enough heat. The only calories it packs on, are from heart-healthy Omega 3’s!</p>
<p>The calorie content in salmon can be well over 300 calories, or as low as well under 200 calories.<br />
You want to always buy salmon labeled wild” and not farmed.</p>
<p>Wild salmon has fewer calories and half the fat content of the same amount of farmed salmon, and it is better for you.</p>
<p>While farmed salmon is sometimes praised for having slightly more omega-3 fatty acids, it is also very high in saturated fat &#8211; which is a type of fat you do not want.</p>
<p>Farmed salmon is also known for having more unsafe contaminants, chemicals from polluted waters, and other pollutants. Farmed salmon comes with the potential of antibiotic use.<br />
Wild salmon does not.</p>
<p>Some good choices would be WILD sockeye (red), king, keta, coho, or atlantic.</p>
<p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>4 (4-6 ounce) wild salmon fillets</li>
<li>⅛ -¼ cup peanut oil</li>
<li>2 tablespoons soy sauce (or coconut aminos)</li>
<li>2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar</li>
<li>2 tablespoons green onions, chopped</li>
<li>1 teaspoon brown sugar</li>
<li>1 cloves garlic, minced</li>
<li>½-1 teaspoon ground ginger</li>
<li>1 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes</li>
<li>½ teaspoon sesame oil</li>
<li>Pinch of salt</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Directions:</strong><br />
Place salmon fillets in a glass dish.</p>
<p>In a separate bowl, combine the peanut oil, soy sauce, vinegar, green onions, brown sugar, garlic, ginger, red pepper flakes, sesame oil, and salt. Whisk well and pour over the fish.</p>
<p>Cover and let marinate in the refrigerator for at least 4 to 6 hours.</p>
<p>Transfer filets to aluminum foil and place them on the grill.</p>
<p>Grill 10 minutes per inch of thickness. Turn over halfway through cooking.</p>
<p>*With any meat, it is best to use a food thermometer to ensure you do not under-cook or overcook for your liking. For salmon, it is re</p>
<p>commended the internal temp reach 145. Keep in mind that meat will continue to cook just a tad after it leaves the grill*</p>
<p>If you want to really keep with New England tradition, pair your salmon with some peas! They ate salmon with this nutritious veggie .. because it too .. was in season at the time!</p>

<p><strong>RECIPE 3: GRILLED VEGGIES</strong><br />
Pair your salmon with some grilled sugar snap peas! Peas are one of several vegetables that are great cooked up on the grill!</p>
<p>Grilling your veggies is one of the healthiest side-dishes you can enjoy at your cookout. Put them on a kabob, throw them in some aluminum foil, or put them straight on the grill… no oil needed!</p>
<p>Many veggies do well on the grill, but a few really shine!</p>
<p>Asparagus, eggplant, mushrooms, onions, zucchini, eggplant, and bell peppers are excellent options!</p>
<p>Of course, you can’t go wrong with some corn on the cob. Just keep in in mind that corn is a vegetable that is higher in carbs!</p>

<p><strong>RECIPE 5: HEALTHY POTATO SALAD</strong><br />
<strong>(Approx 8 Servings)</strong><br />
Traditional potato salad is drowning in high fat mayonnaise! This recipe lightens things up by using non-fat greek yogurt! We promise that making this smart swap will not compromise any of the flavor in this popular BBQ side dish. Go with one type of potato, or use a colorful medley, if you want to go with a “red-white-blue” theme!</p>
<p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>2 pounds russet, yukon gold, or red potatoes.</li>
<li>1 tablespoon salt (for cooking potatoes)</li>
<li>½ cup plain, non-fat, greek yogurt</li>
<li>2 tablespoons fat-free or light mayonnaise</li>
<li>1 teaspoon dijon mustard</li>
<li>¾ teaspoons salt</li>
<li>½ teaspoon black pepper</li>
<li>½ teaspoon onion powder</li>
<li>½ cup chopped celery</li>
<li>3 tablespoons pickle relish (or pickles)</li>
<li>2 tablespoons minced red onions</li>
<li>2 tablespoons minced parsley or dill</li>
<li>2 hard-boiled eggs</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Instructions:</strong><br />
Peeled and cut the potatoes into approx ¾-inch cubes.<br />
Place in a saucepan covered with one-inch of water, over medium-high heat.<br />
Bring to boil and add 1-tablespoon salt.<br />
Reduce heat to medium and let simmer.</p>
<p>Stir several times during cooking. Cook for approximately 8-10 minutes, or until potatoes are tender.<br />
Drain and set aside.</p>
<p>While potatoes are cooking, whisk together yogurt, mayo, mustard, salt, pepper, and onion powder. Peel and cut hard-boiled eggs into small cubes.</p>
<p>Add the yogurt/mayo mixture to potatoes and stir slowly to combine.</p>
<p>Add the celery, pickles, red onions, parsley, and chopped eggs to the potato mixture, stir to combine.</p>
<p>Cover and refrigerate until chilled (at least 1 hour before serving)</p>

<p><strong>RECIPE 6: Low(er) Calorie Baked Beans</strong><br />
<strong>(Approx 10-12 servings)</strong></p>
<p>Baked beans are a cookout staple, but they are often soaked in ketchup and/or BBQ (remember what we said about condiments containing all kinds of hidden calories.) They also usually have fatty bacon and lots of brown sugar and/or molasses.</p>
<p>This recipe dials down the calories by subbing turkey bacon .. reduces sodium and sugar by using tomato sauce .. and further lightens the sugar-load by using stevia brown sugar!</p>
<p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>2 slices turkey bacon (chopped)</li>
<li>1 diced onion</li>
<li>15 ounce can navy beans , rinsed and drained</li>
<li>15 ounce can pinto beans , rinsed and drained</li>
<li>15 ounce can northern beans , rinsed and drained</li>
<li>1/2 cup tomato sauce</li>
<li>1 1/2 cups water</li>
<li>1 tsp Worcestershire sauce</li>
<li>1/4 tsp smoked​ paprika</li>
<li>1/2 cup stevia brown sugar</li>
<li>1 tablespoon yellow mustard</li>
<li>1 teaspoon chili powder</li>
<li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
<li>1/4 teaspoon black pepper</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Instructions:</strong><br />
In a large cooking pot &#8211; add bacon (with a little oil or spray oil) and cook on medium heat.<br />
Remove bacon once cooked.</p>
<p>Add onions to the pot and cook until translucent.</p>
<p>Add in beans, tomato sauce, water, dark brown sugar, yellow mustard, chili powder, salt and pepper, and stir.</p>
<p>Bring to a boil then reduce to a simmer. Cook for 45-60 minutes (until thick)</p>

<p><strong>RECIPE 7: PROTEIN APPLE PIE</strong><br />
Apple Pie is a longstanding American favorite .. I’m sure you’ve even heard the phrase .. as American as Apple Pie. I’m not sure why we say that, because neither apples nor apple pie originally came from America.</p>

<p><strong>NON-ALCOHOLIC PATRIOTIC PUNCH</strong><br />
(Perfect following your patriotic pump workout.)</p>
<p>Ingredients:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://sculptnation.com/products/bcaas" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sculpt Nation Fruit Punch BCAAs</a> (prepared with water)</li>

Fill up your cup all the way with ice cubes.<br />
Pour in your pre-made <a href="https://sculptnation.com/products/bcaas" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sculpt Nation BCAAs</a> (about ⅓ of the way)<br />
Add a few more ice cubes.<br />

<p>It is that time of year!! 4th of July is upon us!!</p>
<p>Burgers on the grill … fireworks in the sky … and for many .. an excuse to skip the gym and eat thousands of calories .. in one sitting!</p>
<p>It can be tempting to throw your diet and training mindset out the window when holidays come around. But you must treat holidays just like you would any other day.</p>
<p>Have fun .. enjoy the time with family … and even enjoy all the food .. but keep your goals in mind. One of the best things you can do .. is still get in a solid workout!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>We’ve got the perfect 4th of July PRE PARTY PUMP!</strong></em></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-7322" src="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_8006.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_8006.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_8006.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_8006.jpeg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_8006.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>The workout we&#8217;re giving you below will not only burn a ton of calories .. the endorphins released from this short HIIT workout will boost your mood .. which will help you keep your healthy food habits in mind when it’s time to fire up the grill!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>We will never tell you that you need to “earn” your calories .. that is not the kind of relationship with food we promote here at V Shred &amp; Sculpt Nation.</strong></em></p>
<p>Food should never be seen as “the enemy” or “a reward” .. and exercise should never be viewed as punishment.</p>
<p>Diet culture makes us feel bad about having a nice dinner with friends, and it makes us fall into the mind trap that holidays will make us gain weight.</p>
<p><em><strong>What happens next?</strong></em></p>
<p><img class="size-large wp-image-7158" src="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_215638387.jpeg?resize=1024%2C684&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="684" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_215638387.jpeg?resize=1024%2C684&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_215638387.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_215638387.jpeg?resize=768%2C513&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_215638387.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_215638387.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>We feel guilt .. and view exercise as “punishment” we “have” to get up and do the next day .. or as justification that if we burn a ton of calories pre-feast .. it’s okay to eat that extra serving of ice cream or calorie-filled cocktail.</p>
<p>Once you get this mentality, you will begin an endless (and very unhealthy) relationship with food. You will start to believe you ALWAYS have to earn food .. and will only feel okay about enjoying yourself .. if you have exercised.</p>
<p>Instead, look at your patriotic pump as a FREEDOM that you are blessed to have! You have an able body that GETS to move!!!</p>
<p>And view all that 4th of July food as FUEL! Getting in a workout before a big meal is a great way to rev up your metabolism and prepare your body to USE (instead of store) any extra calories you may consume!</p>
<p>Don’t fall into this food guilt trap<em>..</em>But also don’t go to the totally opposite end of the spectrum and make the holidays an excuse to be lazy and throw all your food mindfulness out the window! Use the short 15-minute workout  below and then ENJOY your day!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>Alright .. let’s get our PATRIOTIC PUMP ON!!</strong></em></p>
<p>Here is a quick fat blasting FOLLOW-ALONG cardio workout that won’t interfere with your day full of fun with friends and family!</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='1170' height='659' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/HzkBonK4kPQ?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The video above is a FOLLOW ALONG! Just press play and get to work! This fat-blasting workout consists of only 5 exercises. You will do each exercise for 40 seconds and take a quick 20-second break before moving on to the next exercise.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Explosive Squat with Calf Raises &#8211; 40 Seconds</strong><br />
<strong>Speed Skaters &#8211; 40 Seconds</strong><br />
<strong>High Knees &#8211; 40 Seconds</strong><br />
<strong>Alternating Toe Taps &#8211; 40 Seconds</strong><br />
<strong>Bicycles &#8211; 40 Seconds</strong></p>
<p>It only takes 15 minutes and can be done from home with NO EQUIPMENT! You don’t even need a mat or a timer! Since it’s a follow-along .. we’ve got everything taken care of for you!</p>

<p>If you have a lot of weight to lose, or if you are just trying to lose that last layer of fat covering your mid-section, THIS <em><strong><a href="https://sculptnation.com/products/fat-loss-stack" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FAT LOSS STACK</a> could help!</strong></em></p>
<p>Now, of course, you can’t just take some supplements and do this short ab workout we are about to show you, and expect to be shredded.</p>
<p>You have to exercise and follow a nutrition plan that is best for your body type. If you aren’t sure what yours is .. check out this <strong><a href="https://vshred.com/sp/survey/survey-aka1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FREE QUIZ</a></strong>! It will tell you what your body type is and give you 3 most important things you need to do to get in shape based on the way YOU are built!</p>
<p>If you have put off getting in shape for summer, you may be tempted to set unrealistic goals or turn to some silly quick-fix detox diet… <em><strong>don’t do that!</strong></em></p>
<p>First of all, there is no such thing. Second, no matter what your short-term goals are, your focus should always be on long-term success.</p>
<p>Training and eating for <a href="https://vshred.com/sp/survey/survey-aka1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">your body type</a> will always be the best way to achieve that!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>Now that we’ve covered the most important bases to help you reveal that summer six-pack… let’s get to BUILDING your abs … with this killer core workout!</strong></em></p>

<p>Since the sun is finally shining brighter and temperatures are rising a bit, we want to encourage you to<em><strong> take some of your workouts OUTDOORS!</strong></em></p>
<p>Lack of motivation is one of the biggest reasons people skip training. There&#8217;s nothing quite like surrounding yourself with nature and breathing in some fresh air. It is the perfect motivator to get you moving!</p>
<p>Being outdoors helps lower stress, clears your mind, improves happiness, and according to some studies, can even up your calorie burn a little bit!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>Put on some SPF, pound some <a href="https://sculptnation.com/products/pre-workout" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pre-workout</a> to help you push through, </strong></em><br />
<em><strong>head outside to a nice even spot in the grass, and follow along for this</strong></em><br />
<em><strong>5 Exercise Ab Workout .. that will leave your core on fire!</strong></em></p>

<p><img class="size-large wp-image-7388" src="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_183074918.jpeg?resize=1024%2C567&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="567" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_183074918.jpeg?resize=1024%2C567&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_183074918.jpeg?resize=300%2C166&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_183074918.jpeg?resize=768%2C425&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_183074918.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_183074918.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>If there was a magic pill that allowed you to not exercise, eat what you want, and never gain an ounce of fat… everyone would be walking around with a six-pack and a slice of pizza.</p>
<p>There is no such thing.</p>
<p>But if some of the top researchers in the world are correct .. <em><strong>there may be a BIOLOGICAL “LOOPHOLE”</strong></em> … that helps support the speed of the metabolism (which dictates how much fat you can lose.)</p>
<p>It’s so effective… <em><strong>they are calling it “THE FUTURE OF FAT LOSS”!!</strong></em></p>
<p>This IS going to sound too good to be true.<br />
This IS going to sound like a bunch of hype.</p>
<p>Because this loophole is NOT a diet plan, a workout video, or anything else you may think of when it comes to burning fat.</p>
<p>We had a hard time believing it too.</p>
<p>But the science on this one is pretty clear.<br />
<em><strong>This discovery is all about how your body, and your fat cells, communicate.</strong></em></p>
<p>Once you change this communication process, it seems that it is possible to <em><strong>force your body to support burning it’s deepest fat stores</strong></em>. You know, the ones that seem immune to hardcore workouts and ultra-strict diets.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>It can all happen because of something called … Simultaneous Fat Release.</strong></em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-7129" src="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_331033280.jpeg?resize=1170%2C658&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1170" height="658" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_331033280.jpeg?w=6000&amp;ssl=1 6000w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_331033280.jpeg?resize=300%2C169&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_331033280.jpeg?resize=768%2C432&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_331033280.jpeg?resize=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_331033280.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_331033280.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1170px) 100vw, 1170px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>How do you promote the activation of your body’s “simultaneous fat release” capabilities?<br />
We are about to tell you!!</p>
<p>It’s crazy!! But once you know how to change the conversation that’s happening between your fat cells… you can finally help alter the way your body burns fat ..rapidly!</p>
<p><em><strong>For real! This hack only takes about 30 seconds to add to your day!!</strong></em></p>
<p>Before we tell you what scientists say the solution is .. let’s go back to the first discovery researchers made .. so that we can better understand why all this happens to begin with.</p>
<p><strong>FAT CELL SIGNALING</strong><br />
Researchers found that our fat cells talk to each other. It’s called Fat Cell Signaling.</p>
<p>Fat cells are not merely big blobs that sit in silence. They are rather chatty and not only talk to each other, but to other cells in your body.</p>
<p>Right now, as you read this, your fat cells are deciding whether or not they are going to put your body into fat-burning mode or fat-storing mode.</p>
<p>If you <span style="text-decoration: underline;">NEVER</span> struggle with your weight… congrats! That means your fat cells are probably having a nice chat.</p>
<p>However, if you feel like you struggle to lose weight, those same 10 pounds keep coming back, most diets fail, or you can’t seem to get rid of “stubborn” areas of fat .. your fat cells are most likely having a conversation you don’t want them to have.</p>
<p>Most of us fall into that second category because our bodies were designed to store fat.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>Chances are the conversation your cells are having over-and-over again ..</strong></em><br />
<em><strong>is to HOLD ON to fat .. not burn it.</strong></em></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-7130" src="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_209544099.jpeg?resize=1170%2C780&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1170" height="780" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_209544099.jpeg?w=5910&amp;ssl=1 5910w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_209544099.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_209544099.jpeg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_209544099.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_209544099.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_209544099.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1170px) 100vw, 1170px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>This means you can do all the cardio in the world and eat an overly restrictive diet but still be holding on to a stubborn layer of fat!</p>
<p>Of course, how much body fat you have will depend on lots of factors (diet, exercise, stress, sleep, genetics, etc.) But your fat cells ultimately make this decision through that constant communication (fat cell signaling).</p>
<p>This new research also explains why some of the most popular American diets don’t work long term. Sorry “keto” and “low-fat” .. science says your restrictive diets DO NOT have the ability to change the way your fat cells communicate.</p>
<p>However, scientists discovered a receptor in your body that CAN help alter this communication process. Once “activated”, it can help complement any “diet” and exercise program you choose.<br />
It’s called the TRPV1 Receptor.</p>
<p><strong>WHAT IS THE TRPV1 RECEPTOR</strong><br />
A professor of neurosurgery, biological chemistry, and neuroscience at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine was the first to discover this receptor.</p>
<p>You have TRPV1 Receptors throughout your entire body. Their main job is to regulate your body’s temperature and energy usage. It kicks in when your body temperature increases.</p>
<p>For example, when you are doing cardio or working out. TRPV1 senses this temperature spike and tells your fat cells to start burning their contents for energy.</p>
<p><strong>WHAT HAPPENS WHEN TRPV1 RECEPTORS ARE ACTIVATED (“Simultaneous Fat Release”)</strong><br />
Now it’s time to tell you about that “loophole” we mentioned.</p>
<p>Scientists discovered that when these receptors are activated, they help tell your fat cells to start communicating differently. They tell them to burn themselves for energy, instead of holding on and storing in places like your stomach and thighs.</p>
<p>This is important….<br />
It means that TRPV1 can actually alter the conversation that’s happening between your fat cells. In fact, they found <em><strong>when you activate TRPV1 Receptors, you can support fat burning virtually EVERYWHERE .</strong></em></p>
<p>The ability to burn fat EVERYWHERE all at once is called “Simultaneous Fat Release.”</p>
<p>This process can force your body to support burning the fat you already have (even your deepest fat stores)..</p>
<p><em><strong>Simultaneous Fat Release can fundamentally transform your body’s relationship with fat…</strong></em> because once you activate your body’s “simultaneous fat release” capabilities.. you can stay in fat-burning support mode virtually all day …burning unhealthy fat build-up EVERYWHERE in your body.</p>
<p><strong>HOW TO ACTIVATE TRPV1 RECEPTORS (simultaneous fat release)</strong></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-7131" src="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_342916350.jpeg?resize=1170%2C771&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1170" height="771" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_342916350.jpeg?w=4802&amp;ssl=1 4802w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_342916350.jpeg?resize=300%2C198&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_342916350.jpeg?resize=768%2C506&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_342916350.jpeg?resize=1024%2C675&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_342916350.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_342916350.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1170px) 100vw, 1170px" data-recalc-dims="1" /><br />
As mentioned, one way to activate the TRPV1 Receptors is through super-intense workouts.<br />
But scientists have found that we can also activate our TRV1 Receptors another way.</p>
<p>They discovered that these receptors can also be activated by eating a common spice found in red chili peppers. It’s called Capsaicin.</p>
<p>Over the years, NUMEROUS studies have been done on the effectiveness of Capsaicin.</p>
<p><em><strong>Here are the findings of only A FEW ….</strong></em></p>
<ul>
<li>“Capsaicin was found to enhance energy expenditure and fat burning in humans, particularly those with a high Body Mass Index (BMI.)”</li>
<li>“Participants in the Capsaicin group saw a significant decrease in stomach fat when used as part of a weight management program.”</li>
<li>“The Capsaicin group lost nearly double the weight of the placebo group.”</li>
<li>“The Capsaicin group increased their body’s fat-burning potential by up to 46.4% when used daily for 8 weeks, while the placebo group saw no improvement at all.”</li>
<li>“Capsaicin activates TRPV1 Receptors and significantly increases metabolism and fat burning potential.”</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>OF COURSE, it’s not as easy as eating some red chili peppers!!</strong></em></p>
<p>All of the studies mentioned used a Capsaicin supplement. That is because the amount of chili peppers needed to activate your TRPV1 receptors is very high. It would make you physically sick if you attempted to EAT that many chili peppers (don&#8217;t do that.)</p>
<p>With a supplement, you can safely consume Capsaicin at a much higher quantity.</p>
<p>BEFORE YOU EXIT THIS ARTICLE and attempt to “google” Capsaicin ..<em><strong> there is something very important you need to know about this spice.</strong></em></p>
<p>The supplement form of Capsaicin isn’t hard to find. However, it can vary dramatically both in quality and effectiveness.</p>
<p>You have to ensure that the Capsaicin you choose is time-released and has a special coating.</p>
<p>For that reason, there’s only one form of Capsaicin that we stand behind. <em><strong>This specific formula of Capsaicin has already helped over 1.2 Million people (and counting) finally lose fat and help keep it off when combined with diet and exercise!</strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>THIS FORM OF CAPSAICIN is in high demand &#8211; but very limited supply.</strong></em></p>
<p>Only a select group of supplement manufacturers can get access to this specific form of Capsaicin.</p>
<p>Whether you are making progress but can’t seem to blast that last bit of fat, or are just getting started and have a long way to go, you can provide support to help SPEED UP fat loss once you tell your fat cells how to communicate with each other!</p>
