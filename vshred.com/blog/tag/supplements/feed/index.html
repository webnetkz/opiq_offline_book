<p><strong>RECIPE 1: CAULIFLOWER BUNS</strong><br />
*Servings will vary pending the size you want to make your buns*</p>
<p>Using cauliflower instead of bread may sound unappealing, but with the right recipe, you won’t notice the cauliflower taste. You will only be left with hundreds of calories that you can use somewhere else (like on our healthy protein apple pie or sugar free jello shots.)</p>
<p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>1 (12 oz) bag cauliflower rice</li>
<li>1 egg white</li>
<li>1 tbsp coconut flour</li>
<li>1/4 tsp salt</li>
<li>1-1/2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
<li>1 tsp each of any other seasonings you want your bun to taste like!</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Directions:</strong><br />
Steam the cauliflower according to the package; drain until ALL WATER IS REMOVED (this is key) and let cool. You may want to use a cheesecloth or dry paper towels to make sure ALL water is removed.</p>
<p>Whisk together the coconut flour, baking powder, seasonings, add the cauliflower mixture, and egg white. Stirring until blended. If the batter is too dry, try adding teaspoons of unsweetened nut milk, or even water, to reach desired consistency.</p>
<p>There are several methods you can use to make your buns! Here are a few!</p>
<p><em><strong>Muffin Tins</strong></em><br />
Distribute evenly into muffin tins. Bake in the preheated oven for 40 to 45 minutes until golden brown at edges and centers feel set when lightly touched. Transfer to a cooling rack and let cool completely before removing. Slice them in half and serve up!</p>
<p><em><strong>QUICK TIP</strong></em> … You can also use this batter and pour it directly into a small sprayed skillet .. in a mini-waffle or pancake maker .. or even in the microwave!!</p>
<p><em><strong>For the microwave version&#8230;</strong> </em><br />
Pour a couple of inches of batter into a deep coffee mug. The larger it is, the better, unless you are eating a tiny patty of meat. Microwave time will vary, but zap it about 45 seconds and see if it’s ready. If not, keep adding 10 seconds at a time until done!</p>
<p>Don’t overcook, or it will be too dry. Dump out of the mug .. let cool .. cut in half …. Enjoy!</p>
<p><em><strong>TIP</strong></em> .. if they still don’t seem “toasted” enough. You can always throw them on the grill, put them in a toaster oven, or even an air-fryer!</p>

<p><strong>RECIPE 2: FIRECRACKER GRILLED SALMON</strong><br />
You may not think of salmon as being a 4th of July staple, but eating this super healthy fish on Independence Day .. is a tradition in New England!</p>
<p>According to history buffs, it started by coincidence. During the mid-summer months, salmon was plentiful in that region. Because it was “in season” &#8211; it always ended up on the dinner table for Independence Day! Even though salmon is available year-round now, the holiday tradition of eating salmon on the 4th remains to be a big deal there!</p>
<p>If you want to celebrate like the New Englanders .. this grilled salmon recipe is tasty, tangy, and packs just enough heat. The only calories it packs on, are from heart-healthy Omega 3’s!</p>
<p>The calorie content in salmon can be well over 300 calories, or as low as well under 200 calories.<br />
You want to always buy salmon labeled wild” and not farmed.</p>
<p>Wild salmon has fewer calories and half the fat content of the same amount of farmed salmon, and it is better for you.</p>
<p>While farmed salmon is sometimes praised for having slightly more omega-3 fatty acids, it is also very high in saturated fat &#8211; which is a type of fat you do not want.</p>
<p>Farmed salmon is also known for having more unsafe contaminants, chemicals from polluted waters, and other pollutants. Farmed salmon comes with the potential of antibiotic use.<br />
Wild salmon does not.</p>
<p>Some good choices would be WILD sockeye (red), king, keta, coho, or atlantic.</p>
<p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>4 (4-6 ounce) wild salmon fillets</li>
<li>⅛ -¼ cup peanut oil</li>
<li>2 tablespoons soy sauce (or coconut aminos)</li>
<li>2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar</li>
<li>2 tablespoons green onions, chopped</li>
<li>1 teaspoon brown sugar</li>
<li>1 cloves garlic, minced</li>
<li>½-1 teaspoon ground ginger</li>
<li>1 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes</li>
<li>½ teaspoon sesame oil</li>
<li>Pinch of salt</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Directions:</strong><br />
Place salmon fillets in a glass dish.</p>
<p>In a separate bowl, combine the peanut oil, soy sauce, vinegar, green onions, brown sugar, garlic, ginger, red pepper flakes, sesame oil, and salt. Whisk well and pour over the fish.</p>
<p>Cover and let marinate in the refrigerator for at least 4 to 6 hours.</p>
<p>Transfer filets to aluminum foil and place them on the grill.</p>
<p>Grill 10 minutes per inch of thickness. Turn over halfway through cooking.</p>
<p>*With any meat, it is best to use a food thermometer to ensure you do not under-cook or overcook for your liking. For salmon, it is re</p>
<p>commended the internal temp reach 145. Keep in mind that meat will continue to cook just a tad after it leaves the grill*</p>
<p>If you want to really keep with New England tradition, pair your salmon with some peas! They ate salmon with this nutritious veggie .. because it too .. was in season at the time!</p>
<p>Not sure how to enjoy this green veggie … check out our next recipe idea!</p>

<p><strong>RECIPE 3: GRILLED VEGGIES</strong><br />
Pair your salmon with some grilled sugar snap peas! Peas are one of several vegetables that are great cooked up on the grill!</p>
<p>Grilling your veggies is one of the healthiest side-dishes you can enjoy at your cookout. Put them on a kabob, throw them in some aluminum foil, or put them straight on the grill… no oil needed!</p>
<p>Many veggies do well on the grill, but a few really shine!</p>
<p>Asparagus, eggplant, mushrooms, onions, zucchini, eggplant, and bell peppers are excellent options!</p>
<p>Of course, you can’t go wrong with some corn on the cob. Just keep in in mind that corn is a vegetable that is higher in carbs!</p>

<p><strong>RECIPE 4: SUMMER SALAD </strong><br />
<strong>(Serving size &#8211; 1 large salad</strong>)</p>
<p>There is just something satisfying about a nice summer salad! This one follows a “red, white, and blue” theme .. with fresh blueberries, strawberries, and a virtually <em><strong>calorie free</strong></em> <em><strong>homemade vinaigrette dressing!</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>2 cups mixed salad greens of choice</li>
<li>1/4 c fresh blueberries</li>
<li>1/4 c fresh sliced strawberries</li>
<li>4 oz grilled lean protein from the grill</li>
<li>1/2 c cooked quinoa, rice, or cauliflower rice.</li>
<li>2 tbsp. Crumbled fat-free feta cheese</li>
<li>2 tbsp. Fat Free Vinaigrette (DIY recipe below)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Instructions:</strong><br />
Toss all ingredients except dressing together… mix up .. enjoy!</p>
<p><strong>**Healthy Homemade Vinaigrette Dressing**</strong><br />
This comes with a warning. You may never want to buy salad dressing again! It will be hard to believe that something this good .. is virtually calorie-free (minus the few calories in the mustard and stevia.)</p>
<p>The base of this recipe can be altered to go with any salad! Think greek seasonings and lemon juice for a greek salad! Get creative!</p>
<p>The amounts below should be enough to cover 1-2 salads.</p>
<p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>6 tablespoons vinegar: balsamic, white wine, champagne, apple cider, rice, or red wine vinegar.</li>
<li>4 teaspoons mustard: Dijon is the best, but you can also use yellow, brown, or spicy.</li>
<li>2 teaspoons Stevia (or a few squirts/drops of liquid stevia if that is what you typically use)</li>
<li>1 clove garlic, crush or minced (or some garlic salt)</li>
<li>2-4 tablespoons water</li>
<li>Salt &amp; pepper to taste</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Instructions:</strong><br />
Simply whisk together and pour over salad!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>RECIPE 5: HEALTHY POTATO SALAD</strong><br />
<strong>(Approx 8 Servings)</strong><br />
Traditional potato salad is drowning in high fat mayonnaise! This recipe lightens things up by using non-fat greek yogurt! We promise that making this smart swap will not compromise any of the flavor in this popular BBQ side dish. Go with one type of potato, or use a colorful medley, if you want to go with a “red-white-blue” theme!</p>
<p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>2 pounds russet, yukon gold, or red potatoes.</li>
<li>1 tablespoon salt (for cooking potatoes)</li>
<li>½ cup plain, non-fat, greek yogurt</li>

<p><strong>RECIPE 6: Low(er) Calorie Baked Beans</strong><br />
<strong>(Approx 10-12 servings)</strong></p>
<p>Baked beans are a cookout staple, but they are often soaked in ketchup and/or BBQ (remember what we said about condiments containing all kinds of hidden calories.) They also usually have fatty bacon and lots of brown sugar and/or molasses.</p>
<p>This recipe dials down the calories by subbing turkey bacon .. reduces sodium and sugar by using tomato sauce .. and further lightens the sugar-load by using stevia brown sugar!</p>
<p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>2 slices turkey bacon (chopped)</li>
<li>1 diced onion</li>
<li>15 ounce can navy beans , rinsed and drained</li>
<li>15 ounce can pinto beans , rinsed and drained</li>
<li>15 ounce can northern beans , rinsed and drained</li>
<li>1/2 cup tomato sauce</li>
<li>1 1/2 cups water</li>
<li>1 tsp Worcestershire sauce</li>
<li>1/4 tsp smoked​ paprika</li>
<li>1/2 cup stevia brown sugar</li>
<li>1 tablespoon yellow mustard</li>
<li>1 teaspoon chili powder</li>
<li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
<li>1/4 teaspoon black pepper</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Instructions:</strong><br />
In a large cooking pot &#8211; add bacon (with a little oil or spray oil) and cook on medium heat.<br />
Remove bacon once cooked.</p>
<p>Add onions to the pot and cook until translucent.</p>
<p>Add in beans, tomato sauce, water, dark brown sugar, yellow mustard, chili powder, salt and pepper, and stir.</p>
<p>Bring to a boil then reduce to a simmer. Cook for 45-60 minutes (until thick)</p>

<p><strong>NON-ALCOHOLIC PATRIOTIC PUNCH</strong><br />
(Perfect following your patriotic pump workout.)</p>
<p>Ingredients:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://sculptnation.com/products/bcaas" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sculpt Nation Fruit Punch BCAAs</a> (prepared with water)</li>
<li>Blue Sports Drink (Zero calorie version)</li>
<li>Diet Sprite or 7-Up</li>
<li>Crushed ice</li>
<li>Regular ice cubes</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Instructions:</strong><br />
Fill up your cup all the way with ice cubes.<br />
Pour in your pre-made <a href="https://sculptnation.com/products/bcaas" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sculpt Nation BCAAs</a> (about ⅓ of the way)<br />
Add a few more ice cubes.<br />
Slowly pour a layer of blue Gatorade (about another ⅓ of the way up) directly over the ice cubes.<br />
Add crushed ice and slowly pour on the diet soda.</p>
<p>Using crushed ice should help keep the “colors” from mixing as much. It also gives the “white” to your red-white-blue drink theme!</p>

<p><strong>WATERMELON &amp; CUCUMBER TONIC</strong><br />
<strong>(Approx 8 servings)</strong></p>
<p>Pass up on the sugary pre-made mixers and go with the natural sweetness from fruit!<br />
This cocktail includes fresh watermelon and cucumber juices as it’s base!</p>
<p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>1/4 cup mint leaves.</li>
<li>1/4 cup fresh lemon juice</li>
<li>1 English cucumber, peeled and sliced</li>
<li>2 1/2 cups cold tonic water</li>
<li>1 1/4 cups gin</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Instructions:</strong><br />
Combine half each of the watermelon, mint, juice, and cucumber in a blender and blend until smooth.</p>
<p>Using a sieve and some cheesecloth, strain the watermelon mixture over a bowl, reserving the juice mixture.</p>
<p>Make sure and squeeze the contents in the cloth, so you get all of the juice mixture.</p>
<p>Repeat using the rest of the watermelon, mint, juice, and cucumber.</p>
<p>Combine 2 1/2 cups of the juice mixture you just made, tonic water, and gin.</p>
<p>Stir well and serve over ice.</p>

<p>It is that time of year!! 4th of July is upon us!!</p>
<p>Burgers on the grill … fireworks in the sky … and for many .. an excuse to skip the gym and eat thousands of calories .. in one sitting!</p>
<p>It can be tempting to throw your diet and training mindset out the window when holidays come around. But you must treat holidays just like you would any other day.</p>
<p>Have fun .. enjoy the time with family … and even enjoy all the food .. but keep your goals in mind. One of the best things you can do .. is still get in a solid workout!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>We’ve got the perfect 4th of July PRE PARTY PUMP!</strong></em></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-7322" src="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_8006.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_8006.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_8006.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_8006.jpeg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_8006.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>The workout we&#8217;re giving you below will not only burn a ton of calories .. the endorphins released from this short HIIT workout will boost your mood .. which will help you keep your healthy food habits in mind when it’s time to fire up the grill!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>We will never tell you that you need to “earn” your calories .. that is not the kind of relationship with food we promote here at V Shred &amp; Sculpt Nation.</strong></em></p>
<p>Food should never be seen as “the enemy” or “a reward” .. and exercise should never be viewed as punishment.</p>
<p>Diet culture makes us feel bad about having a nice dinner with friends, and it makes us fall into the mind trap that holidays will make us gain weight.</p>
<p><em><strong>What happens next?</strong></em></p>
<p><img class="size-large wp-image-7158" src="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_215638387.jpeg?resize=1024%2C684&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="684" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_215638387.jpeg?resize=1024%2C684&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_215638387.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_215638387.jpeg?resize=768%2C513&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_215638387.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_215638387.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>We feel guilt .. and view exercise as “punishment” we “have” to get up and do the next day .. or as justification that if we burn a ton of calories pre-feast .. it’s okay to eat that extra serving of ice cream or calorie-filled cocktail.</p>
<p>Once you get this mentality, you will begin an endless (and very unhealthy) relationship with food. You will start to believe you ALWAYS have to earn food .. and will only feel okay about enjoying yourself .. if you have exercised.</p>
<p>Instead, look at your patriotic pump as a FREEDOM that you are blessed to have! You have an able body that GETS to move!!!</p>
<p>And view all that 4th of July food as FUEL! Getting in a workout before a big meal is a great way to rev up your metabolism and prepare your body to USE (instead of store) any extra calories you may consume!</p>
<p>Don’t fall into this food guilt trap<em>..</em>But also don’t go to the totally opposite end of the spectrum and make the holidays an excuse to be lazy and throw all your food mindfulness out the window! Use the short 15-minute workout  below and then ENJOY your day!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>Alright .. let’s get our PATRIOTIC PUMP ON!!</strong></em></p>
<p>Here is a quick fat blasting FOLLOW-ALONG cardio workout that won’t interfere with your day full of fun with friends and family!</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='1170' height='659' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/HzkBonK4kPQ?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The video above is a FOLLOW ALONG! Just press play and get to work! This fat-blasting workout consists of only 5 exercises. You will do each exercise for 40 seconds and take a quick 20-second break before moving on to the next exercise.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Explosive Squat with Calf Raises &#8211; 40 Seconds</strong><br />
<strong>Speed Skaters &#8211; 40 Seconds</strong><br />
<strong>High Knees &#8211; 40 Seconds</strong><br />
<strong>Alternating Toe Taps &#8211; 40 Seconds</strong><br />

<p>It doesn’t require any equipment. We are using bodyweight only, and it can be adjusted to any fitness level!</p>
<p>Of course, you can do this working indoors if you choose, but as long as you are hydrated, try breaking a sweat outside!</p>
<p>Taking your workouts outdoors has a ton of benefits .. here are a few!</p>
<p><strong>3 BENEFITS OF EXERCISING OUTSIDE</strong></p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-7153" src="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_222896530.jpeg?resize=1170%2C780&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1170" height="780" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_222896530.jpeg?w=5040&amp;ssl=1 5040w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_222896530.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_222896530.jpeg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_222896530.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_222896530.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_222896530.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1170px) 100vw, 1170px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><strong>1: You May Burn More Calories</strong><br />
Some small studies found outdoor exercisers burn a few more calories than those who exercise indoors. The theory is that exercising outdoors exerts more energy.</p>
<p>Be careful.. this could have the opposite effect if you are attempting to workout when temperatures are extreme.</p>
<p>Working out when it’s too hot could affect your endurance. You may also be more tempted to shorten the duration of your workout.</p>
<p>Try doing your outdoor workouts early in the morning before temperatures spike, or later in the evening.</p>
<p>Always stay extra hydrated and above all.. listen to your body!</p>
<p><strong>2: It Could Cheer You Up</strong><br />
Hundreds of studies have shown that soaking up the sun and being surrounded by mother nature helps alleviate stress and improve overall mood!</p>
<p>Exercising outdoors has even been shown to enhance your brain! Researchers say this is because being outside stimulates all five senses at once &#8211; something that can’t be achieved inside a gym or your living room.</p>
<p>Head outside .. breathe in some fresh air .. take a moment to appreciate the beauty around you! Maybe even take off your headphones and listen to the sounds of nature!</p>
<p>A little natural Vitamin D is no doubt a great motivator to get moving!</p>
<p><strong>3: It Saves You Money</strong><br />
Gym memberships are not cheap. Not to mention, they often go unused.</p>
<p>How many times have you paid for a year and only showed up once or twice a week, or even worse, gone months without entering a building that you pay to use?</p>
<p>If you can go every day, a gym membership is no doubt worth the money. But despite what most believe, it’s not required to get in a solid training session.</p>
<p>That is why we focus on so many home workouts on our <strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/vshred" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">YouTube Channel</a></strong>, and why we recently created an entire program called <a href="https://vshred.com/sp/move/soc-all" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MOVE</a> that can be done from home. You can check that out <a href="https://vshred.com/sp/move/soc-all" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>HERE</strong></a> if you are interested!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>ALRIGHT… let’s break a sweat!</strong></em></p>

<p>Since the sun is finally shining brighter and temperatures are rising a bit, we want to encourage you to<em><strong> take some of your workouts OUTDOORS!</strong></em></p>
<p>Lack of motivation is one of the biggest reasons people skip training. There&#8217;s nothing quite like surrounding yourself with nature and breathing in some fresh air. It is the perfect motivator to get you moving!</p>
<p>Being outdoors helps lower stress, clears your mind, improves happiness, and according to some studies, can even up your calorie burn a little bit!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>Put on some SPF, pound some <a href="https://sculptnation.com/products/pre-workout" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pre-workout</a> to help you push through, </strong></em><br />
<em><strong>head outside to a nice even spot in the grass, and follow along for this</strong></em><br />
