<p>It is that time of year!! 4th of July is upon us!!</p>
<p>Burgers on the grill … fireworks in the sky … and for many .. an excuse to skip the gym and eat thousands of calories .. in one sitting!</p>
<p>It can be tempting to throw your diet and training mindset out the window when holidays come around. But you must treat holidays just like you would any other day.</p>
<p>Have fun .. enjoy the time with family … and even enjoy all the food .. but keep your goals in mind. One of the best things you can do .. is still get in a solid workout!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>We’ve got the perfect 4th of July PRE PARTY PUMP!</strong></em></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-7322" src="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_8006.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_8006.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_8006.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_8006.jpeg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_8006.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>The workout we&#8217;re giving you below will not only burn a ton of calories .. the endorphins released from this short HIIT workout will boost your mood .. which will help you keep your healthy food habits in mind when it’s time to fire up the grill!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>We will never tell you that you need to “earn” your calories .. that is not the kind of relationship with food we promote here at V Shred &amp; Sculpt Nation.</strong></em></p>
<p>Food should never be seen as “the enemy” or “a reward” .. and exercise should never be viewed as punishment.</p>
<p>Diet culture makes us feel bad about having a nice dinner with friends, and it makes us fall into the mind trap that holidays will make us gain weight.</p>
<p><em><strong>What happens next?</strong></em></p>
<p><img class="size-large wp-image-7158" src="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_215638387.jpeg?resize=1024%2C684&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="684" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_215638387.jpeg?resize=1024%2C684&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_215638387.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_215638387.jpeg?resize=768%2C513&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_215638387.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_215638387.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>We feel guilt .. and view exercise as “punishment” we “have” to get up and do the next day .. or as justification that if we burn a ton of calories pre-feast .. it’s okay to eat that extra serving of ice cream or calorie-filled cocktail.</p>
<p>Once you get this mentality, you will begin an endless (and very unhealthy) relationship with food. You will start to believe you ALWAYS have to earn food .. and will only feel okay about enjoying yourself .. if you have exercised.</p>
<p>Instead, look at your patriotic pump as a FREEDOM that you are blessed to have! You have an able body that GETS to move!!!</p>
<p>And view all that 4th of July food as FUEL! Getting in a workout before a big meal is a great way to rev up your metabolism and prepare your body to USE (instead of store) any extra calories you may consume!</p>
<p>Don’t fall into this food guilt trap<em>..</em>But also don’t go to the totally opposite end of the spectrum and make the holidays an excuse to be lazy and throw all your food mindfulness out the window! Use the short 15-minute workout  below and then ENJOY your day!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>Alright .. let’s get our PATRIOTIC PUMP ON!!</strong></em></p>
<p>Here is a quick fat blasting FOLLOW-ALONG cardio workout that won’t interfere with your day full of fun with friends and family!</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='1170' height='659' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/HzkBonK4kPQ?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The video above is a FOLLOW ALONG! Just press play and get to work! This fat-blasting workout consists of only 5 exercises. You will do each exercise for 40 seconds and take a quick 20-second break before moving on to the next exercise.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Explosive Squat with Calf Raises &#8211; 40 Seconds</strong><br />
<strong>Speed Skaters &#8211; 40 Seconds</strong><br />
<strong>High Knees &#8211; 40 Seconds</strong><br />
<strong>Alternating Toe Taps &#8211; 40 Seconds</strong><br />

<p>Being a father is no doubt a blessing, but not always for your body. The demands of family life often mean a dad’s personal health becomes less of a priority.</p>
<p>Family duties aside, just being a man, in general, has a mound of pressures.</p>
<p>From the need to be successful, to the “act tough and hide weakness” mentality that guys are often taught.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>Society places a lot of responsibilities on men and data shows</strong></em><br />
<em><strong>you agree that it’s not good for you.</strong></em></p>
<p>A recent survey revealed that most men believe the pressures society places on them are unhealthy … with <em><strong>54% citing WEIGHT GAIN as their number one DAILY concern.</strong></em></p>
<p>Once you add “dad” to the list .. these pressures add up even more .. which usually results in putting health and fitness on the back burner.</p>
<p>Going to the gym and eating healthy falls to the bottom of the priority list.</p>
<p>So you shrug it off and embrace the “dad bod” look.</p>
<p>When the words dad bod went viral a few years ago (implying this was a physique women preferred) &#8211; guys worldwide celebrated!</p>
<p>But is this body type what women really prefer? Probably not.</p>
<p>Even more, is it a physique that makes YOU feel good? Also, not likely.</p>
<p>If you are confident with your expanding waistline .. that is great! You should love the skin you&#8217;re in ….</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>But you can’t ignore the health issues that come with having a dad bod physique.</strong></em></p>
<p><a href="https://sculptnation.com/products"><img class="size-full wp-image-7256" src="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_302233816.jpeg?resize=1170%2C781&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1170" height="781" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_302233816.jpeg?w=7360&amp;ssl=1 7360w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_302233816.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_302233816.jpeg?resize=768%2C513&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_302233816.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_302233816.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_302233816.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1170px) 100vw, 1170px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>The primary feature of a “dad bod” is an overall soft physique with very little muscle and a midsection that carries quite a bit of excess fat.</p>
<p>This type of belly fat is called Visceral Fat and can be very dangerous to your health.</p>
<p>Maybe your significant other tells you they like the extra cushion .. and perhaps you are totally fine with rocking a beer belly .. but it is important to keep in mind that storing a bit of extra fat around the midsection isn&#8217;t great for long term health.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>To be a good spouse and father .. you must take care of yourself.</strong></em></p>
<p>After all, you want to have the energy needed to respond to these pressures, right? Even more, I’m sure you want to enjoy life with your family!</p>
<p>Not to mention .. kids often mimic their parent’s behaviors. When a father figure is health-focused, it’s more likely the entire family will follow in his footsteps! By making your health a priority, you can be a fantastic role model in your home!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>There is no better time than Father’s Day ..</strong></em><br />
<em><strong>to remind yourself that YOU (and YOUR health) matters!</strong></em></p>
<p>To get rid of the fat that is a defining feature of dad bod .. you need to build muscle and drop body fat.</p>
<p>The best way to lose overall body fat is to focus on weight-training and throw in some high-intensity interval training cardio. It would help if you also established a lifestyle centered around proper nutrition.</p>
<p>Then you will want to focus on ab training at least a few days a week.</p>
<p>While you can’t “spot reduce” belly fat .. you must tone the muscles underneath so that once you start shedding pounds .. you will have a six-pack to reveal!</p>
<p>One of the best ways to train abs is through circuit training. It’s fast-paced .. which means your heart rate is more elevated. So, in addition to strengthening your core, circuits get you into a fat-burning zone.</p>
<p>I put together an <strong>8 MINUTE KILL YOUR DAD BOD AT HOME AB WORKOUT</strong> for all the busy dads out there. It only requires body weight and can be done from anywhere.</p>
<p>We aren’t suggesting you workout ON Father’s Day .. unless you want to. Relax! It’s your day!<br />
Hit the golf course, get outside and play with your kids, enjoy a big steak dinner, and save this killer 8 Minute Ab Workout for later!</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>40 Seconds On / 20 Seconds Off / 2 rounds</strong><br />
Straight Arm Russian Twists<br />
Heel Taps<br />
Opposite Toe Touches<br />
Bicycle Crunches</p>
<p>I’m sure you often preach to the mom of your household that she needs to take care of herself.</p>
<p>You probably tell your kids that they need to eat their veggies, and you likely encourage them to participate in sports that keep them active and healthy .. but what about you?</p>
<p>Spend a little time this Father’s Day, reflecting on the ways you can take better care of yourself!</p>

<p>Summer is here and the sun is out! With the summer sun comes swimsuits, and swimsuits mean your body is going to be on full display.</p>
<p>Unlike the fellas, who can cover up their REAR VIEW in a pair of swim trunks, ladies have to expose it all.</p>
<p><em><strong>Not fair .. we know.</strong></em></p>
<p>BUT we’ve got you covered (so you can confidently be uncovered) &#8211; with a <em><strong>12-minute home glute workout</strong></em> &#8211; that will help you blast fat and build curves in all the right places!</p>
<p><em><strong>Speaking of the summer sun….</strong></em><br />
While the weather is pleasant, try leaving your living room and take your training outside!<br />
The fresh air and bright sunshine can be a great motivator to get moving!</p>
<p><em><strong>Studies say being outdoors….</strong></em></p>
<ul>
<li>Lowers stress hormones (which can impact things like appetite and weight)</li>
<li>Re-sets your ability to focus &amp; boosts creativity</li>
<li>Supports immune health</li>
<li>May help you burn a few more calories (because of the extra energy required.)</li>
<li>++ More</li>
</ul>
<p>Outdoor training may not be ideal for every workout, but the one we are showing you today is really short &#8211; only 12-minutes!</p>
<p>Don’t forget your sunscreen and plenty of water! Let’s get that summer booty poppin!</p>
<p>You don’t need any equipment for this workout, but if you have some weights or bands, feel free to add them.</p>
<p>We will perform all exercises as “super-sets” .. this means you will do “Exercise A &amp; B” without any rest in-between. Then you will get a quick break before moving on to the next superset, and so on.</p>
<p>The reason we are doing supersets is to keep things moving. This keeps your heart-rate up and will ensure you are getting the most out of your time.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>12-Minute Follow Along Booty Movements </strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Each exercise will be performed for 20 Seconds. Your rest periods between supersets will also be a quick 20-seconds.</p>

<p>If you have a lot of weight to lose, or if you are just trying to lose that last layer of fat covering your mid-section, THIS <em><strong><a href="https://sculptnation.com/products/fat-loss-stack" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FAT LOSS STACK</a> could help!</strong></em></p>
<p>Now, of course, you can’t just take some supplements and do this short ab workout we are about to show you, and expect to be shredded.</p>
<p>You have to exercise and follow a nutrition plan that is best for your body type. If you aren’t sure what yours is .. check out this <strong><a href="https://vshred.com/sp/survey/survey-aka1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FREE QUIZ</a></strong>! It will tell you what your body type is and give you 3 most important things you need to do to get in shape based on the way YOU are built!</p>
<p>If you have put off getting in shape for summer, you may be tempted to set unrealistic goals or turn to some silly quick-fix detox diet… <em><strong>don’t do that!</strong></em></p>
<p>First of all, there is no such thing. Second, no matter what your short-term goals are, your focus should always be on long-term success.</p>
<p>Training and eating for <a href="https://vshred.com/sp/survey/survey-aka1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">your body type</a> will always be the best way to achieve that!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>Now that we’ve covered the most important bases to help you reveal that summer six-pack… let’s get to BUILDING your abs … with this killer core workout!</strong></em></p>
<p><img class="size-large wp-image-7377" src="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_190365467.jpeg?resize=1024%2C684&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="684" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_190365467.jpeg?resize=1024%2C684&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_190365467.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_190365467.jpeg?resize=768%2C513&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_190365467.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_190365467.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>Since the sun is finally shining brighter and temperatures are rising a bit, we want to encourage you to<em><strong> take some of your workouts OUTDOORS!</strong></em></p>
<p>Lack of motivation is one of the biggest reasons people skip training. There&#8217;s nothing quite like surrounding yourself with nature and breathing in some fresh air. It is the perfect motivator to get you moving!</p>
<p>Being outdoors helps lower stress, clears your mind, improves happiness, and according to some studies, can even up your calorie burn a little bit!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>Put on some SPF, pound some <a href="https://sculptnation.com/products/pre-workout" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pre-workout</a> to help you push through, </strong></em><br />
<em><strong>head outside to a nice even spot in the grass, and follow along for this</strong></em><br />

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Newborn/Infant Workout Ideas Ideas</strong></p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-7097" src="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_249502416.jpeg?resize=1170%2C698&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1170" height="698" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_249502416.jpeg?w=5468&amp;ssl=1 5468w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_249502416.jpeg?resize=300%2C179&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_249502416.jpeg?resize=768%2C458&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_249502416.jpeg?resize=1024%2C611&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_249502416.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_249502416.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1170px) 100vw, 1170px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Congrats! You have the perfect human dumbbell! They may cry, kick, and scream at times .. but on the bright side, that just provides a little more resistance, right?</p>
<p>Another perk of using your infant for resistance is that you will naturally use progressive overload because infants grow….fast! This means that almost weekly your “weight” will become heavier and more of a challenge!</p>
<p>When it comes to a newborn/infant, you will need to be selective with exercise choice and modify how you hold your baby if they are unable to hold their head up on their own. And for all you new mamas .. you always want to have approval from your doctor before resuming physical activity post-pregnancy!</p>
<p><em><strong>Using your baby instead of a traditional weight is an easy modification to make!</strong></em><br />
Take a look at any weight lifting workout you currently do or find one of our home workouts on the V Shred <a href="https://www.youtube.com/vshred" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">YouTube Channel</a> that uses simple weights like dumbbells.</p>
<p>Instead of holding the weight .. carefully hold your baby! Or if you have a body baby carrier, strap them in and get to work!</p>
<p><em><strong>Here is an idea!</strong></em><br />
Do an EMOM workout! This training style isn’t technically named after you mamas, but EMOM workouts are a great way to get in a good workout if you have limited time (which we know is an issue for many moms.)</p>
<p>EMOM stands for every minute on the minute. You perform a different exercise every minute. You begin the prescribed number of reps at the top of the minute and then get to rest for whatever time is left until the next top of the minute!</p>
<ul>
<li>Pick any movements from the list below or use your own.</li>
<li>Set a timer for the length you choose. We like using a duration of 10 minutes. That means you will be doing 10 different</li>
<li>exercises, in only 10 minutes!</li>
<li>When all exercises are complete, rest &amp; repeat as many times as you want!</li>
<li>You can use the same movements for your next round(s) &#8211; or pick different ones.</li>
<li>We like doing 30 total minutes, if possible. The first round upper body, second round lower body, and the third round abs &amp; cardio.</li>
</ul>
<p>Remember, your goal is to get in the prescribed number of reps in less than a minute.<br />
The faster you finish .. the more rest time you get! You may need to adjust reps based on your fitness level.</p>

<p><strong>Baby Squat Shoulder Press (15 reps)</strong><br />
Stand with feet slightly wider than shoulder-width apart and your toes pointed slightly out. Hold your baby with hands positioned under armpits. While holding the baby, perform your squat, and as you come up, lift the baby into the air above your head into a shoulder press.</p>
<p><strong>Baby Squat Front Delt Raise (15 reps)</strong><br />
Perform these the same way as the baby squat above, except raise your baby up into a front raise (to about chest height) as you lower into your squat.</p>
<p><strong>Baby Squat Press (15 reps)</strong><br />
Perform these the same way as the baby squat above, except hold your baby close to your chest and push out into a chest press as you squat down.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>**Change your with foot position if you are incorporating more than one squat press into your EMOM workout! Go super wide into a sumo stance more glute/hamstring focused squats, or super wide with toes pointed further out in a plie position to work inner thighs**</em></p>
<p><strong>Forward Lunge With Baby Twist (5 reps each leg, for 10 total twisting lunges)</strong><br />
Hold your baby in whatever position you find most comfortable. Lunge forward with your right leg. Before you bring your left foot forward, twist/rotate your upper body to the right while leaving your lower body stationary in the lunge position. Rotate back to center and bring your back foot forward to complete the lunge. Do the same thing on the opposite side, always twisting in the direction of your front foot. Continue walking forward until you have completed 10 total steps.</p>
<p><strong>Loving Walking Lunges (10 each leg for 20 total steps)</strong><br />
Do these in the same way you perform the walking lunge with a twist; however, you do not do the twist; you simply keep walking and lunging!</p>
<p><strong>Baby Weight Glute Bridge (15 slow and controlled reps)</strong><br />
Lie on your back with your knees bent and your feet hip-distance apart. Place your baby on your lap. Raise your hips into a glute bridge (try to keep most of the weight in your heels) and squeeze big at the top before slowly lowering back to the floor.</p>
<p><strong>Baby Ab Crunch (15 crunches)</strong><br />
Lie face-up on the floor with your knees bent in the air at a 90-degree angle.<br />
Stabilize your baby, so it is resting on your shins, and hold onto his/her hands.<br />
To perform the crunch, slowly extend your legs away from you as you lift your shoulder blades off the ground. Slowly curl your upper body forward into a crunch, and at the same time, bring your knees in toward your chest. Stretch your legs out while leaning back &#8211; as far as you can reach. Repeat.</p>
<p><strong>Baby Chest Press (15 presses)</strong><br />
Lie on your back with your knees bent and your feet hip-distance apart. Place your baby on your chest and press them toward the ceiling. Squeeze your pecs together before lowering them back to the starting position.</p>
<p><img class="size-large wp-image-7114" src="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_228555310-1.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_228555310-1.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_228555310-1.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_228555310-1.jpeg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_228555310-1.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><strong>Standard Push-Up Kisses (15 pushups)</strong><br />
On a mat, lay your baby underneath you. Start in a high plank position with your wrists under your elbows and your abs engaged. Lower down until your elbows are bent to 90 degrees, and give your baby a kiss! Come to your knees to make the push-up easier.</p>
<p><strong>Tricep Push-Up Kisses (15 pushups)</strong><br />
Perform these push-ups the same way you do the standard push up above, except you will keep your arms parallel to your sides and your elbows pointing back. Come to your knees to make the push-up easier.</p>
<p><strong>Burpee Kisses (10 burpees)</strong><br />
Perform in the same way you did the push-ups. You may need to scoot your baby slightly forward since you will need enough room to jump or step your feet forward to perform your burpee. You can skip the pushup portion if you want to make these less advanced.</p>
<p><strong>Baby Lat Pullover (15 pullovers)</strong><br />
Lie on your back with your knees bent and your feet flat. Sit your baby on your chest, holding them under their arms. Lift them straight up, keeping your arms mostly straight, with only a slight bend in your elbows to prevent locking, throughout the entire movement. Extend your arms backward over your head as far back as you can. Return to the starting position by slowly pulling and squeezing with your lats and chest. Watch for those kicking little feet &#8211; otherwise, you might end up with a foot to the face 🙂</p>
<p><strong>Baby Bicep Hammer Curls (15 curls)</strong><br />
Hold your baby in front of you. Keeping elbows glued to your sides, and raise him or her to your chest in a curl. Don’t let your elbows swing outward and squeeze your biceps hard at the top of the movement. Return to start to complete one rep.</p>
<p><strong>Tummy Time Human Supermoms (10 supermans, with a hold at top)</strong><br />
On a mat, lay your baby on its tummy. Lay on your stomach face to face with your baby.<br />
Keep your neck in a neutral position and extend your arms and legs out straight out and wide.<br />
Keep your arms and legs straight and tummy glued to the mat as you simultaneously lift your arms and legs up toward the ceiling. Squeeze your lower back and glutes and hold for two to five seconds before you lower back down to the starting position.</p>
<p><strong>Tummy Time Human Lat Pulldowns (15 pullbacks with a big squeeze)</strong><br />
In the same position as the supermoms, do the exact same movement. Instead of holding at the top of the movement, pull your elbows down to your sides and squeeze. Reverse the movement. That is one rep. You can use a loop band or even a rolled up towel to make these even more difficult!</p>

<p><strong>Baby Reverse Ab Crunches (15 crunches)</strong><br />
Lie face up on the floor, and bring your knees toward your chest. Place your baby on your shins. Contract your abs to gently tilt your hips up off the floor as you lift your head and shoulders at the same time. Lower and repeat.</p>
<p><strong>Pop Jump Peek-A-Boo (15 jumps)</strong><br />
Lay your baby on a mat in front of you. Start with your feet together and then jump your legs out as far as you can into a low squat. Immediately jump back to your starting position. Play a game of peek-a-boo with your hands as you “pop” for each rep! Go fast! This is a cardio plyometric move to get your heart rate up!</p>
<p><strong>Tickle Squat Jumps (15 jumps)</strong><br />
This is another plyometric cardio movement. Lay your baby on a mat in front of you. Perform squat jumps, and at the bottom of every jump, give your baby a little toe tickle! Get creative! You can do this for any jumping “plyo” type movement (jumping lunges, starfish jumps, skaters, etc.)</p>
<p><strong>Baby Swings (15 swings)</strong><br />
Hold your baby under its arms facing you. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart.<br />
With a slight bend in your knees, your back flat and neck straight, hinge your hips back as you swing your baby between the inside the quads and then forcefully drive your hips forward as you swing your baby in front of you, traveling no higher than your shoulders. Control the descent as you immediately go into the next rep.</p>
<p><strong>Baby Russian Twists (10 each side for 20 total twists)</strong><br />
While sitting, hold your baby under its bottom and upper back, or under its arms. Lean back onto your tailbone with legs bent. Engage your core and twist from left to right while holding your baby. Try not to let your feet touch the floor!</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-7101" src="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_205815699.jpeg?resize=1170%2C781&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1170" height="781" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_205815699.jpeg?w=7360&amp;ssl=1 7360w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_205815699.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_205815699.jpeg?resize=768%2C513&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_205815699.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_205815699.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_205815699.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1170px) 100vw, 1170px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Tummy Time Planks (30 seconds without dropping)</strong><br />
On a mat, lay your baby underneath you and come to a forearm plank position. Keep your core tight, quads engaged and back flat &#8211; don’t let your hips sag or rise up. Hold your plank for 30 seconds (or longer if you want) and have a little chit-chat with your infant, or sing a song to help pass the time!</p>
<p><strong>Baby Ab Bicycles (15 cycles. One rep is once you have done each leg)</strong><br />
While sitting, hold your baby under its bottom and upper back, or under its arms. Lean back onto your tailbone with legs bent. Engage your core and cycle those legs while holding your baby straight up in the air.</p>
<p><strong>Tummy Time Plank Ups (10 plank ups. One rep is after you have done each side.)</strong><br />
On a mat, lay your baby underneath you and come to a high plank (push-up) position.<br />
Make sure your hands are directly under your shoulders.<br />
Keep your core tight, quads engaged and back flat &#8211; don’t let your hips sag or rise up.<br />
Lower down to your elbows one at a time. Then one at a time come back up to that high plank position. That is one rep.</p>
<p><strong>Tummy Time Plank Jacks (15 jacks)</strong><br />
On a mat, lay your baby underneath you and come to a high plank position.<br />
Jump your legs wide and then back together, just like a jumping jack motion. If this is too difficult, you can alternate legs, taping each foot out to the side. You can also try performing this in a low plank. Do whatever feels best for you!</p>
<p><strong>Tummy Time Mountain Climbers (15 reps. One rep is after you have done each side)</strong><br />
On a mat, lay your baby underneath you and come to a high plank (push-up) position.<br />
Make sure your hands are directly under your shoulders and weight on just your toes. Engage your core and start “running” &#8211; bringing your knees forward to your chest one at a time.</p>
<p><strong>Baby Tricep Press (15 reps)</strong><br />
Lay flat on your mat. Holding your baby around their waist, put the baby&#8217;s face over your face with your elbows pinned in close to your side. Only flexing your elbows, press your baby toward your thighs, lengthening arms as far as you can comfortably while squeezing your triceps. Reverse the movement back to the starting position.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Toddler Workout Ideas</strong><br />
You will still be able to use a growing toddler for resistance &#8211; your weight will obviously just be a bit heavier.</p>

<p>You can do any of the exercises above; however, you may want to adjust the rep range to be a tad lower since your “weight” will be more substantial.</p>
<p>Once your child is crawling and walking .. getting in a lift WITH them may become more challenging. Their attention span is shorter, so you will want to keep that in mind when selecting your mommy-and-me workout style.</p>
<p>EMOM or timer-based workouts can still work, but since there aren’t any real “breaks” with this style of training, it may be best to stick to standard set and rep style training… in case you need to chase them down between exercises!</p>
<p>As your toddler gets older, you can even make your timer-based sweat sessions a game, where they help you watch the timer or countdown with/for you!</p>
<p><strong>Toddler Backpack Lift</strong><br />
Just as you can with an infant, for any of the EMOM movements above, you can also strap your toddler into a forward or rear-facing backpack carrier and get to work!</p>
<p>If you don’t have that type of carrier for movements like squats, lunges, planks, and pushups, you can ask your toddler to crawl on your back and hold on tight!</p>
<p>Some of the above movements may even be more suitable with a toddler compared to an infant since they can hold their head up on their own.</p>
<p>Here are a few other exercises you can add to the list above that work well with a toddler.</p>
<ul>
<li>Bear Crawls (have them climb on your back or follow along)</li>
<li>Crab Walks (have them mimic you)</li>
<li>Lateral Side Shuffles (have them shadow you and make it a race)</li>
<li>High Knees (an easy one to have them mimic)</li>
<li>Jumping Jacks (another one your kids will love to try)</li>
<li>Box Jumps (give them a small step or just ask them to jump up and down)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Have A Dance Party</strong><br />
Dancing is a fun way to burn a ton of calories! You may have to compromise and turn on Baby Shark instead of Beyonce, but make a playlist full of songs that will keep your kiddos attention for however long you want to break a sweat and JUST DANCE! You don’t have to have any dancing skills. Do anything that keeps you moving and gets your heart rate up!</p>

<p><strong>Stroller Workout</strong><br />
Buy a jogging stroller and get moving! You can keep things simple and just go for a brisk walk or jog. To make things more challenging, you can find hills and push your stroller up them to simulate a treadmill incline walk or hill-sprints. You can also stop every couple of minutes and do some “strolling” lunges, plyometric jumps, strength moves like push-ups, etc.</p>
<p>If you are short on time or just want to make the most out of your walk around the block, try incorporating HIIT intervals into your stroller time.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>Here is an example of a short lower body focused HIIT cardio stroller workout!</strong></em><br />
Start with a brisk 5-minute stroller walk warm-up. Then do every exercise for 45 seconds and rest for 15 seconds before moving on to the next exercise. Once you are finished with the entire circuit, stop for some kisses for about a minute and repeat the circuit one more time!</p>
<ul>
<li>Stroller Push Walking Lunges</li>
<li>Lock &amp; Squat Jump (Stop where you are, lock your stroller and do jump squats)</li>
<li>Stroller Push Run/Sprint</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Water Workout</strong><br />
You obviously won’t be able to swim laps unless you have someone else in the pool supervising with you, but if you have a toddler that loves water, there are numerous exercises you can do with your kiddo that will help you get in a killer workout!</p>
<p>Doing a workout in water adds resistance on it’s own, but you can also add wrist or ankle weights to make your water workout even more challenging!</p>
<p>Hold your toddler for some of these movements, for others, put them in an appropriate floating device and have them next to you while you perform these aquatic style exercises!</p>
<ul>
<li>Water Walk (Hold your baby above your head as you walk for a challenge)</li>
<li>Jumping Jacks</li>
<li>High Knees</li>
<li>Pool Wall Push-Ups</li>
<li>Fast Leg Kick/Flutters</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Kids 5+ Workout Ideas</strong></p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-7104" src="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_329192772.jpeg?resize=1170%2C780&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1170" height="780" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_329192772.jpeg?w=5760&amp;ssl=1 5760w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_329192772.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_329192772.jpeg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_329192772.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_329192772.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_329192772.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1170px) 100vw, 1170px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Once your kids get a little bit older, they will naturally be curious about your workouts.<br />
Use their “monkey-see-monkey-do” stage of life to your advantage!</p>
<p>Pending their age and personality, you can do any of the baby or toddler workouts above.<br />
If they are too heavy, instead of using your kids for weight, use dumbbells or bands and have them exercise with you! You can purchase “kid weights” online, or give them a light canned good, bag of rice, etc.</p>
<p>For things like the sit-ups, and glute-ham raise, you can even ask them to “help mommy” by sitting on your feet!</p>
<p>Just like toddlers, attention spans may be short, so you may want to try Tabata or HIIT style workouts. Anything that gets the job done .. fast!</p>
<p>Other exercises you can do with your 5+ kids:</p>
<ul>
<li>Jump Rope</li>
<li>Mini trampoline/trampoline jumping.</li>
<li>Racing down the length of your yard.</li>
<li>Any “sport” that requires activity &#8211; a game of football, basketball, baseball, or how about some dodgeball!</li>
<li>Yoga</li>
</ul>
<p>When you are finished, have them join you in the kitchen for a kid-friendly <a href="https://sculptnation.com/products/protein" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sculpt Nation Protein</a> smoothie!</p>
<p>You must give your body a fast-acting and easily digestible protein after a workout. You want to avoid going into a catabolic (muscle breakdown) state. If you let your muscles starve after training, that is exactly what you risk!</p>
<p>The quicker you rush quality, highly bioavailable <a href="https://sculptnation.com/products/protein" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PROTEIN</a> into your system post-workout, the faster you’ll increase your lean muscle, burn body fat, improve performance, and build strength.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Dog Mom Workout</strong><br />
Some moms only have kids with four legs and fur. Having a dog is a great way to ensure you get in those daily steps! Take them on several long walks, or if they aren’t too lazy of a breed, get them to jog with you! Just be careful if you live somewhere that it gets hot&#8230; the pavement could burn their little paws!</p>
<p>Pending the size (and personality) of your dog, you can do any of the exercises in our EMOM workout example and use your furry friends for a little resistance!</p>
<p>The biggest challenge you may face (other than an attention span that is likely even shorter than a human toddler) &#8211; is anything on the floor, like yoga!</p>
<p>When you are on “their level” … they will probably confuse YOUR mat time .. to be THEIR play time!</p>
<p>In case you need a smile or want to see some of the exercises above in action .. check out this video of one of our V Shred employees attempting to get in a workout with her 10-pound “fur child” Stella!</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>WHAT IS YOUR DEFINITION OF A MOM?</strong></p>
<p>If you ask Webster, the definition of MOM is: A female parent.</p>
<p>If you ask us, we think the definition of MOM is: One person who does the work of 50. Someone that sacrifices everything without asking for anything in return. The one who you can always count on above everyone else. A cheerleader, counselor, role model, a shoulder to cry on. The one that loves and accepts you no matter what.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Even with expensive equipment designed to target glutes, access to heavy weights, and a booty building expert as a trainer&#8230; <em><strong>developing a better backside is NOT easy.</strong></em></p>
<p>The glutes are innately lazy, a very large muscle group, and need targeted isolation to achieve the activation required to change their shape and size.</p>
<p>Knowing this may lead you to wonder if you can REALLY build a butt at home with .. no machines, no weights, not even resistance bands. Literally nothing except a small space, your body, and your favorite gym shoes.</p>
<p><strong>Yes. You. Can.</strong> (In fact, shoes are totally optional for the workout below)</p>
<p>If your goal is to build lean muscle and re-shape your booty, it is IDEAL to use some form of resistance. But if you stay consistent, do the right exercises, and focus on FEELING your glutes activate with every movement… <em><strong>you don’t NEED anything except your own bodyweight!</strong></em></p>
<p>Of course, if you have dumbbells, a resistance band, kettlebells, or any sort of DIY home weights, adjust the reps or rest periods, and use them!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>GET A BUTT (from home)</strong><br />
<strong>With this booty blasting NO EQUIPMENT workout</strong></p>
<p><img class="wp-image-7046 size-full" src="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_287626739.jpeg?resize=1170%2C780&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1170" height="780" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_287626739.jpeg?w=5859&amp;ssl=1 5859w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_287626739.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_287626739.jpeg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_287626739.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_287626739.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_287626739.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1170px) 100vw, 1170px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><strong>BOOTY WARM UP</strong><br />
Even though you won&#8217;t be using weights for this booty blaster, we still advise you to warm up and <a href="https://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/static+stretch" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">stretch your muscles</a>. Glutes are the biggest muscles in your body. You never want to train “cold” muscles.</p>
<p>Do <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtNGW21016I" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">some DYNAMIC lower body stretching</a> followed by 5 total minutes of things like running in place, jumping jacks, body weight kick-backs, leg swings, and air squats.</p>
<p><strong>8 EXERCISE BOOTY BUILDING CIRCUIT</strong><br />
You will notice that rest time is very minimal. Because we aren’t using any weight, keeping constant stress on the glutes is even more important.</p>
<p>Equally important is being very intentional with every movement. Pay attention to TEMPO and PAUSES! A no-equipment workout is not the time to RUSH.</p>
<p>Focus on slowing things down and pausing at times when your glutes are placed under the most tension. <em><strong>Weight or not .. this is where the booty building magic happens!!</strong></em></p>
<p>Focus on making the most of every rep. If you are using mind-muscle connection, you will feel your glutes activating with each rep.</p>
<ul>
<li>Perform each exercise for 20-30 reps (or as many reps as it takes for you to be totally taxed.)</li>
<li>No Rest or VERY MINIMAL REST between exercises (20 seconds MAX.)</li>
<li>Once you complete the entire 8 exercise circuit, rest for 60 seconds, and then repeat for a total of 2-5 rounds.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Exercise 1: Basic Squat</strong><br />
Stand with your feet about shoulder-width apart. Your toes should be straight forward and SLIGHTLY pointed out.</p>
<p>Keep your chest tall, pull your shoulder blades together, and keep your head up.</p>
<p>Slowly squat down by bending your knees. Keep your feet firmly planted into the floor and knees forward (don’t let them cave in.)</p>
<p>Go as low as you can go, but make sure your knees stay aligned over your feet. Never allow them to go beyond your toes!</p>
<p>Your tempo/pause technique for this movement … take at least 3 seconds during the lowering portion of the squat, pause or pulse for 2 seconds at the bottom, then rise up to the starting position and SQUEEZE your glutes HARD at the top!</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-7048" src="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_321190989.jpeg?resize=1170%2C780&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1170" height="780" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_321190989.jpeg?w=6685&amp;ssl=1 6685w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_321190989.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_321190989.jpeg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_321190989.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_321190989.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_321190989.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1170px) 100vw, 1170px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><strong>Exercise 2: Reverse Lunge</strong><br />
Stand with your feet about shoulder-width apart. Your toes should be straight forward.</p>
<p>Step your right foot back into a deep lunge. Make sure your left knee stays directly over your ankle, and bend your right knee, so it almost touches the floor.</p>
<p>Focus on your left glute as you step your right foot forward back to the starting position.</p>
<p>Repeat the same thing with the other leg. This counts as one rep. You can also do all reps on ONE side before going to the other side.</p>
<p>Your tempo for this movement should be slow and controlled during both the lowering and raising phases. If you want to pause while IN the lunged position, that will make this move more advanced. Do not rest/pause at the top of the movement.</p>

<p><strong>Exercise 3: Bulgarian Split Squats</strong><br />
You will need a slightly raised surface for this one. Anything that is about knee height.</p>
<p>If you find yourself struggling to stay balanced, hold on to a nearby wall, another piece of furniture, someone&#8217;s shoulder, etc.</p>
<p>Stand facing away from your raised surface. Don’t stand too close… that is not good for your knees. On the flip side, standing too far away could put strain on your hip flexors and groin. Generally, the further away you stand, the more hamstring and glute focused it will be. Find your sweet spot!</p>
<p>Keep your core tight, your torso upright, and your hips square to your body.</p>
<p>Hold on to whatever you are using for balance and place your back foot on the elevated surface.</p>
<p>Lower into a lunge, keeping your front knee in line with your front foot. Don&#8217;t let your front knee travel beyond your toes. Your back leg will be resting on the elevated surface and will naturally bend as you lunge.</p>
<p>Drive up through your front heel back to the starting position. Not your back leg. All the work should be on the leg that is out front.</p>
<p>Do all reps on one side &#8211; then switch and do the other leg!</p>
<p>Your tempo/pause technique for this movement will be the same as the reverse lunges.</p>

<p><strong>Exercise 4: Single Leg Foot Elevated Glute Bridge</strong><br />
Head to the floor. You will use the same raised surface you used for the split squats, for these feet elevated glute bridges.</p>
<p>Lay down on your back. With your knees bent, place your feet on the elevated surface. Scoot your body closer or further away to your raised surface. Distance is individual. Just make sure you are in a position to perform the movement with proper form and a good range of motion.</p>
<p>Plant your left foot onto the elevated surface and extend only your right leg into the air. You will be pushing through your left foot .. your right leg will stay extended.</p>
<p>Lift your hips and squeeze your left glute as you push up into a bridge position until your hips are fully extended. When extending into the glute bridge, do not arch your back! Go up just high enough that you are making a long diagonal line from your shoulders to your knee.</p>
<p>Slowly lower back down. Do all reps on one side, then switch legs and do the other side.</p>
<p>Your tempo/pause technique for this movement will be slow and controlled on both the way up and down .. with a big squeeze at the top of the movement .. and no rest at the bottom.</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-7051" src="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_289031650.jpeg?resize=1170%2C780&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1170" height="780" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_289031650.jpeg?w=7952&amp;ssl=1 7952w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_289031650.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_289031650.jpeg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_289031650.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_289031650.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_289031650.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1170px) 100vw, 1170px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><strong>Exercise 5: Side Lying Clam Raise</strong><br />
Roll over to one side. Bend your knees 90 degrees. Your knees and feet should be stacked on top of each other.</p>
<p>Come up on to your forearm so that your hips are hovering over the ground. You can place the other hand on your hip/glutes. Push through your heel as you raise up and rotate your hips open. You will raise your top knee until it points up toward the ceiling (like a clamshell opening.)</p>
<p>Reverse the movement as you return to the starting position. Repeat all reps on one side before rolling over and doing the same on the other side.</p>
<p>Try to never let your hips touch the floor until you have completed all reps. If this is too difficult for you, you can allow your hips to touch the floor between each rep, or as needed.</p>
<p>Your tempo/pause technique for this movement will be slow and controlled on both the way up and down .. with a big squeeze at the top of the movement .. and no rest at the bottom.</p>

<p><strong>Exercise 6: Fire Hydrants</strong><br />
Get on all fours in a tabletop position. Make sure your shoulders are above your hands and your hips above your knees.</p>
<p>Lift your left leg away from your body at a 45-degree angle, keeping your knee at 90 degrees and don’t shift your hips. Squeeze your glutes at the top of the movement and then lower back to the starting position.</p>
<p>Your tempo/pause technique for this movement will be slow and controlled as you raise and lower .. with a big squeeze at the top of the movement .. and no rest at the bottom.</p>

<p><strong>Exercise 7: Kneeling Donkey Kick Ups</strong><br />
Stay in your tabletop position. Lift one leg up behind you while keeping your knee bent.</p>
<p>You should do this in a slow and controlled manner, not using ANY momentum to “kick” your leg up. Focus and let your glute muscle do the lifting!</p>
<p>Keep your foot flexed and raise/pulse your leg until it is in line with your body, and your foot is parallel to the ceiling. This should be a short range of motion. Keep your back still with a neutral spine (don’t arch.)</p>
<p>Your tempo/pause technique for this movement will be slow and controlled as you raise and lower .. with a big squeeze at the top of the movement .. and no rest at the bottom.</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-7054" src="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_212749185.jpeg?resize=1170%2C781&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1170" height="781" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_212749185.jpeg?w=7360&amp;ssl=1 7360w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_212749185.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_212749185.jpeg?resize=768%2C513&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_212749185.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_212749185.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_212749185.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1170px) 100vw, 1170px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><strong>Exercise 8: Shock Pulses</strong><br />
This one is going to sound strange… but it works!</p>
<p>Stand up with your feet about shoulder-width apart (or slightly more narrow.)</p>
<p>All you are going to do is aggressively squeeze your glutes together in a quick “shock” type movement. You will move quickly and do at least 20-30 “shocks” (squeezing as hard as you can every “shock”.)</p>
<p>On every 5th shock pulse .. stop and HOLD THE SQUEEZE AS HARD AS YOU CAN for 5 seconds. No rest .. just keep on shocking and holding .. until you can’t do another rep!</p>
<p>Your glutes will be ON FIRE when you are done!</p>
<p><strong>BOOTY COOL DOWN</strong><br />
When you are done, it’s time to lower your heart rate and give your glutes the recovery they need to repair and grow.</p>
<p>The best way to do this is to spend at least 10 minutes doing <a href="https://glnk.io/nrzp/stacymccloud" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">self myofascial release</a> and <a href="https://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/static+stretch" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">static stretching</a>.</p>
<p>While you are cooling down, you may also want to sip on some <a href="https://sculptnation.com/products/bcaas" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sculpt Nation BCAAS</a> or our <a href="https://sculptnation.com/products/post-workout-fruit-punch" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">POST WORKOUT</a> blend! Both have their own unique blend of post workout recovery support agents that will get you into recovery mode faster and promote a decrease in soreness so you can be ready to crush your next workout!</p>
<p><strong>**TIPS TO MAKE THIS BOOTY BURNER EASIER**</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Use a more shallow range of motion.</li>
<li>Take longer rest periods.</li>
<li>Decrease reps/rounds.</li>
<li>Shorter pauses/faster tempo (not recommended)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>**TIPS TO MAKE THIS BOOTY BURNER MORE DIFFICULT**</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Add weight. If you don&#8217;t have any, look around your house! There are plenty of objects you can use to add resistance (water bottles, detergent, canned foods, a stuffed backpack, etc.)</li>
<li>Minimize rest periods or make them “active rest” by doing jumping jacks, burpees, mountain climbers, jump rope, jump squats, etc.</li>
<li>Add pulses,¼ reps, squeeze harder, make tempo even slower, etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>Just like women should train body parts that guys tend to focus on (biceps and chest, for example) &#8212; <em><strong>every person reading this can benefit from isolated glute training!</strong></em></p>
<p>Glutes are the powerhouse of your body! Focusing on glutes goes beyond aesthetic benefits!<br />
Strong glutes…</p>
<ul>
<li>Help improve posture.</li>
<li>Support functional movements (walking, etc.)</li>
<li>Can improve your squat and deadlift.</li>
<li>Lowers the chance of injury to your back and knees.</li>
<li>Help keep lower body joints healthy (hips, knees, and ankles.)</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: left;"><em><strong>Don’t let lack of equipment be your excuse!</strong></em> You don’t have to have a fancy gym or even home gym equipment to get a good glute workout. Use this workout when you are limited!</p>
