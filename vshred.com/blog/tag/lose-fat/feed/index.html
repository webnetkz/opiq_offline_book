<p>If there was a magic pill that allowed you to not exercise, eat what you want, and never gain an ounce of fat… everyone would be walking around with a six-pack and a slice of pizza.</p>
<p>There is no such thing.</p>
<p>But if some of the top researchers in the world are correct .. <em><strong>there may be a BIOLOGICAL “LOOPHOLE”</strong></em> … that helps support the speed of the metabolism (which dictates how much fat you can lose.)</p>
<p>It’s so effective… <em><strong>they are calling it “THE FUTURE OF FAT LOSS”!!</strong></em></p>
<p>This IS going to sound too good to be true.<br />
This IS going to sound like a bunch of hype.</p>
<p>Because this loophole is NOT a diet plan, a workout video, or anything else you may think of when it comes to burning fat.</p>
<p>We had a hard time believing it too.</p>
<p>But the science on this one is pretty clear.<br />
<em><strong>This discovery is all about how your body, and your fat cells, communicate.</strong></em></p>
<p>Once you change this communication process, it seems that it is possible to <em><strong>force your body to support burning it’s deepest fat stores</strong></em>. You know, the ones that seem immune to hardcore workouts and ultra-strict diets.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>It can all happen because of something called … Simultaneous Fat Release.</strong></em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-7129" src="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_331033280.jpeg?resize=1170%2C658&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1170" height="658" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_331033280.jpeg?w=6000&amp;ssl=1 6000w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_331033280.jpeg?resize=300%2C169&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_331033280.jpeg?resize=768%2C432&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_331033280.jpeg?resize=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_331033280.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_331033280.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1170px) 100vw, 1170px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>How do you promote the activation of your body’s “simultaneous fat release” capabilities?<br />
We are about to tell you!!</p>
<p>It’s crazy!! But once you know how to change the conversation that’s happening between your fat cells… you can finally help alter the way your body burns fat ..rapidly!</p>
<p><em><strong>For real! This hack only takes about 30 seconds to add to your day!!</strong></em></p>
<p>Before we tell you what scientists say the solution is .. let’s go back to the first discovery researchers made .. so that we can better understand why all this happens to begin with.</p>
<p><strong>FAT CELL SIGNALING</strong><br />
Researchers found that our fat cells talk to each other. It’s called Fat Cell Signaling.</p>
<p>Fat cells are not merely big blobs that sit in silence. They are rather chatty and not only talk to each other, but to other cells in your body.</p>
<p>Right now, as you read this, your fat cells are deciding whether or not they are going to put your body into fat-burning mode or fat-storing mode.</p>
<p>If you <span style="text-decoration: underline;">NEVER</span> struggle with your weight… congrats! That means your fat cells are probably having a nice chat.</p>
<p>However, if you feel like you struggle to lose weight, those same 10 pounds keep coming back, most diets fail, or you can’t seem to get rid of “stubborn” areas of fat .. your fat cells are most likely having a conversation you don’t want them to have.</p>
<p>Most of us fall into that second category because our bodies were designed to store fat.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>Chances are the conversation your cells are having over-and-over again ..</strong></em><br />
<em><strong>is to HOLD ON to fat .. not burn it.</strong></em></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-7130" src="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_209544099.jpeg?resize=1170%2C780&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1170" height="780" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_209544099.jpeg?w=5910&amp;ssl=1 5910w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_209544099.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_209544099.jpeg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_209544099.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_209544099.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_209544099.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1170px) 100vw, 1170px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>This means you can do all the cardio in the world and eat an overly restrictive diet but still be holding on to a stubborn layer of fat!</p>
<p>Of course, how much body fat you have will depend on lots of factors (diet, exercise, stress, sleep, genetics, etc.) But your fat cells ultimately make this decision through that constant communication (fat cell signaling).</p>
<p>This new research also explains why some of the most popular American diets don’t work long term. Sorry “keto” and “low-fat” .. science says your restrictive diets DO NOT have the ability to change the way your fat cells communicate.</p>
<p>However, scientists discovered a receptor in your body that CAN help alter this communication process. Once “activated”, it can help complement any “diet” and exercise program you choose.<br />
It’s called the TRPV1 Receptor.</p>
<p><strong>WHAT IS THE TRPV1 RECEPTOR</strong><br />
A professor of neurosurgery, biological chemistry, and neuroscience at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine was the first to discover this receptor.</p>
<p>You have TRPV1 Receptors throughout your entire body. Their main job is to regulate your body’s temperature and energy usage. It kicks in when your body temperature increases.</p>
<p>For example, when you are doing cardio or working out. TRPV1 senses this temperature spike and tells your fat cells to start burning their contents for energy.</p>
<p><strong>WHAT HAPPENS WHEN TRPV1 RECEPTORS ARE ACTIVATED (“Simultaneous Fat Release”)</strong><br />
Now it’s time to tell you about that “loophole” we mentioned.</p>
<p>Scientists discovered that when these receptors are activated, they help tell your fat cells to start communicating differently. They tell them to burn themselves for energy, instead of holding on and storing in places like your stomach and thighs.</p>
<p>This is important….<br />
It means that TRPV1 can actually alter the conversation that’s happening between your fat cells. In fact, they found <em><strong>when you activate TRPV1 Receptors, you can support fat burning virtually EVERYWHERE .</strong></em></p>
<p>The ability to burn fat EVERYWHERE all at once is called “Simultaneous Fat Release.”</p>
<p>This process can force your body to support burning the fat you already have (even your deepest fat stores)..</p>
<p><em><strong>Simultaneous Fat Release can fundamentally transform your body’s relationship with fat…</strong></em> because once you activate your body’s “simultaneous fat release” capabilities.. you can stay in fat-burning support mode virtually all day …burning unhealthy fat build-up EVERYWHERE in your body.</p>
<p><strong>HOW TO ACTIVATE TRPV1 RECEPTORS (simultaneous fat release)</strong></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-7131" src="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_342916350.jpeg?resize=1170%2C771&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1170" height="771" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_342916350.jpeg?w=4802&amp;ssl=1 4802w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_342916350.jpeg?resize=300%2C198&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_342916350.jpeg?resize=768%2C506&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_342916350.jpeg?resize=1024%2C675&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_342916350.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AdobeStock_342916350.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1170px) 100vw, 1170px" data-recalc-dims="1" /><br />
As mentioned, one way to activate the TRPV1 Receptors is through super-intense workouts.<br />
But scientists have found that we can also activate our TRV1 Receptors another way.</p>
<p>They discovered that these receptors can also be activated by eating a common spice found in red chili peppers. It’s called Capsaicin.</p>
<p>Over the years, NUMEROUS studies have been done on the effectiveness of Capsaicin.</p>
<p><em><strong>Here are the findings of only A FEW ….</strong></em></p>
<ul>
<li>“Capsaicin was found to enhance energy expenditure and fat burning in humans, particularly those with a high Body Mass Index (BMI.)”</li>
<li>“Participants in the Capsaicin group saw a significant decrease in stomach fat when used as part of a weight management program.”</li>
<li>“The Capsaicin group lost nearly double the weight of the placebo group.”</li>
<li>“The Capsaicin group increased their body’s fat-burning potential by up to 46.4% when used daily for 8 weeks, while the placebo group saw no improvement at all.”</li>
<li>“Capsaicin activates TRPV1 Receptors and significantly increases metabolism and fat burning potential.”</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>OF COURSE, it’s not as easy as eating some red chili peppers!!</strong></em></p>
<p>All of the studies mentioned used a Capsaicin supplement. That is because the amount of chili peppers needed to activate your TRPV1 receptors is very high. It would make you physically sick if you attempted to EAT that many chili peppers (don&#8217;t do that.)</p>
<p>With a supplement, you can safely consume Capsaicin at a much higher quantity.</p>
<p>BEFORE YOU EXIT THIS ARTICLE and attempt to “google” Capsaicin ..<em><strong> there is something very important you need to know about this spice.</strong></em></p>
<p>The supplement form of Capsaicin isn’t hard to find. However, it can vary dramatically both in quality and effectiveness.</p>
<p>You have to ensure that the Capsaicin you choose is time-released and has a special coating.</p>
<p>For that reason, there’s only one form of Capsaicin that we stand behind. <em><strong>This specific formula of Capsaicin has already helped over 1.2 Million people (and counting) finally lose fat and help keep it off when combined with diet and exercise!</strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>THIS FORM OF CAPSAICIN is in high demand &#8211; but very limited supply.</strong></em></p>
<p>Only a select group of supplement manufacturers can get access to this specific form of Capsaicin.</p>
<p>Whether you are making progress but can’t seem to blast that last bit of fat, or are just getting started and have a long way to go, you can provide support to help SPEED UP fat loss once you tell your fat cells how to communicate with each other!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>Learn more about this scientific discovery and the one of a kind formula that changes the way your body both burns and holds on to stubborn fat….</strong></em></p>

<p>What if someone told you the reason you haven’t seen results, no matter what diet or training plan you follow, isn&#8217;t your fault?</p>
<p>What if there was a “biological hack” that could finally allow you to unleash and promote your full fat-blasting potential?</p>
<p>If researchers from places like Cambridge and Harvard are correct … there is!!</p>
<p><em><strong>The struggle is real&#8230;</strong></em><br />
Trying to re-shape your body by building lean muscle and losing body fat takes time and consistency.</p>
<p><em><strong>We all know that there is not a quick way to go about this.</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>But for some…</strong></em><br />
It doesn’t matter how hard they push, how many hours of cardio they log, or how many calories they restrict &#8211; the changes just don’t seem to happen. Or if they do &#8211; they are painfully slow.</p>
<p><em><strong>If this is you or someone you know…</strong></em> the information in this article could be life-changing!</p>
<p>Some of the top researchers from around the world wanted to find out why some people can’t lose weight no matter what or how hard they try.</p>
<p><em><strong>They made A MAJOR FAT BURNING DISCOVERY!!</strong></em></p>
<p>What we are sharing with you is something even those that don’t struggle with weight issues need to know because&#8230; <em><strong>the culprit is something we all have circulating through our bodies… waiting to attack our fat cells.</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>The reason every diet you have ever tried has failed could be something </strong></em><em><strong>in YOUR BLOOD.</strong></em></p>
<p><a href="http://www.sculptnation.com/turmeric-lp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-7030 size-full" src="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_126280469.jpeg?resize=1170%2C658&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1170" height="658" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_126280469.jpeg?w=8000&amp;ssl=1 8000w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_126280469.jpeg?resize=300%2C169&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_126280469.jpeg?resize=768%2C432&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_126280469.jpeg?resize=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_126280469.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_126280469.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1170px) 100vw, 1170px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>We are NOT talking about genetics.</p>
<p>The genes your parents gave you and your body type aren’t all that matter.<br />
Anyone can have too much of this circulating through their blood.</p>
<p><em><strong>The blame could be because of excess protein.</strong></em></p>
<p>Not the kind you eat. This is a protein that is flowing throughout your body right now even as you read this article, and<em><strong> its job is to BLOCK YOU FROM LOSING WEIGHT!</strong></em></p>
<p>No matter what type of lifestyle change you make&#8230; if you have too much of this protein in your blood&#8230; you could still struggle to lose fat.</p>
<p><em><strong>WHAT IS THIS FAT BLOCKING PROTEIN?!</strong></em><br />
It has a scientific name, but we are just going to call it <strong>THE FAT PROTEIN</strong> &#8211; because that is exactly what it does.<em><strong> It slows down your metabolism and sabotages your efforts to lose weight.</strong></em></p>
<p>These proteins attach themselves to your fat cells and virtually force your body to hold on to fat for dear life! They stop your metabolism from generating the kind of heat it needs to burn fat.</p>
<p>Scientists discovered that people that are overweight have MORE of this protein in their bloodstream.</p>
<p>But why? And what can you do about it?<br />

You need MORE FAT!</p>

<p>Hold up .. we aren’t talking about the kind of body fat you want to get rid of.<br />
We also aren’t referring to “healthy fats” you should eat.</p>
<p>You have TWO types of FAT CELLS in your body, and both play a role in your metabolism.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>White Fat</strong>: This is bad fat. It is responsible for storing excess fat to be later used for energy.</li>
<li><strong>Brown Fat</strong>: This is good fat. It creates heat in your body and revs up your fat-burning metabolism.</li>
</ul>
<p>Researchers found that this fat protein is only made by your WHITE (bad) fat cells.</p>
<p>If this is true, then logic would tell us that you can help tackle this by making LESS white fat and MORE brown fat, right?</p>
<p>How in the world can you do that? Is it even possible? YES!!</p>
<p><em><strong>HOW TO SUPPORT MAKING MORE METABOLISM BOOSTING BROWN FAT&#8230;</strong></em><br />
There are THREE things that researchers have found to help increase the amount of BROWN (good) fat cells that you have.</p>
<p>Unless you like being cold and hungry, you aren’t going to like the first two… they are extreme.</p>
<p>The third method is fast and easy. Researchers found that you can help support and restart your fat-loss engine <em><strong>with a single nutrient.</strong></em></p>
<p>There is an herb that has the potential to promote the conversion of unhealthy white fat cells into fat-burning, thermogenic, brown fat cells.</p>

<p><em><strong>WHAT IS THIS SUPER NUTRIENT THAT INCREASES FAT BLASTING BROWN FAT??</strong></em><br />
It is an ancient herb that very well may be the most effective nutritional supplement in existence. You can purchase it almost anywhere, and it is pretty inexpensive.</p>
<p>Not only is it said to increase the production of brown fat .. this power-house herb has been shown to ….</p>
<ul>
<li>Balance Mood</li>
<li>Support a Healthy Inflammatory Response</li>
<li>Support Carbohydrate Metabolism</li>
<li>Ease Temporary, Activity Related Joint Pain/Stiffness</li>
<li>Support A Healthy Metabolism</li>
<li>Decrease Muscle Soreness</li>
</ul>
<p><em><strong>There is only one problem…</strong></em><br />
This nutrient is poorly absorbed into the bloodstream unless you consume it with other specific substances.</p>
<p>To see its benefits, you have to have a unique blend designed for maximum absorption, in specific ratios!</p>
<p>Quality also counts. Recent research found that some companies lace this ancient herb with pigments (many of which contained lead) &#8211; to enhance its color!</p>
<p><em><strong>Everyone reading this could benefit from this herb&#8230;</strong> </em><br />
But you must ensure the source is safe, and you use a blend that supports enhanced absorption. Otherwise, you are wasting your money.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>If you want to support the rapid production of more fat-burning brown fat and help slow down</strong></em><br />
<em><strong>this fat protein in your blood …</strong></em><br />

<p>We will also tell you about those other two methods that could help your body produce more thermogenic brown fat. But we already know&#8230; Tip #3 is going to be what you choose!</p>
<p><strong>If you are…</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Sick of every diet failing.</li>
<li>Can’t fathom eating any less or training any more than you already do.</li>
<li>Fed up with putting in the work and not seeing results.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>And you want to add support to&#8230;</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Ensure your body is producing GOOD (brown) fat.</li>
<li>Limit the amount of “Fat Protein” flowing through your blood.</li>
<li>Finally, see the results you are working hard to achieve.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>You have to virtually “turn off” these proteins&#8230;</strong><br />
And go directly to one key root cause of all that unwanted fat accumulating in your trouble areas.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>Support to ensure no more failed diets!!!</strong></em><br />
<em><strong>Get your hands on what researchers from some of the most prestigious schools in the world consider to be the most exciting biological hack in weight loss support history!</strong></em></p>
