<p>Family … Friends … Fireworks .. and a lot of FOOD!</p>
<p>That is how the majority of Americans plan to spend The 4th of July … and most of that food will be thrown on the grill .. as July Fourth is the most popular grilling day of the year.</p>
<p>If the idea of an Independence Day cookout has you feeling a little bit anxious about all the extra calories .. relax!!</p>
<p>It may seem like a diet disaster, but with a few adjustments, your cookout won’t set you back one bit!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Here are 5 Tips To Help You Grill Out GUILT FREE …</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>HEALTHY BBQ TIP #1: FIRE UP THE GRILL</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://sculptnation.com/products"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-7313" src="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_83769871.jpeg?resize=1170%2C834&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1170" height="834" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_83769871.jpeg?w=3052&amp;ssl=1 3052w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_83769871.jpeg?resize=300%2C214&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_83769871.jpeg?resize=768%2C547&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_83769871.jpeg?resize=1024%2C730&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_83769871.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w" sizes="(max-width: 1170px) 100vw, 1170px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>If your BBQ includes grilling .. you are in luck. This is one of the best ways to cook meat or make some veggies. You use much less (if any) oil on a grill, as opposed to sautéing or roasting. Grilling alone will really help lower your 4th of July calorie intake.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>HEALTHY BBQ TIP #2: PICK LEAN PROTEINS</strong></p>
<p><img class="size-large wp-image-7335" src="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_187212985.jpeg?resize=1024%2C661&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="661" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_187212985.jpeg?resize=1024%2C661&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_187212985.jpeg?resize=300%2C194&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_187212985.jpeg?resize=768%2C496&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_187212985.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i0.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_187212985.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>Hitting your protein goals on the 4th shouldn’t be a problem. You just need to be careful what cut of meat you choose.</p>
<p>A small burger patty or steak could easily set you back 25 grams of fat or more. Most hot dogs have a minimum of 14 grams of fat. Of course, that is before all the condiments and cheese.</p>
<p>You can still have a juicy, delicious burger, or hot dog, you just need to pick a leaner cut.</p>
<p>Examples of lean cuts of beef are … 96/4 or 90/10 ground sirloin, eye of round steak, sirloin tip steak, top round steak, bottom round steak, and top sirloin steak</p>
<p>For hot dogs .. there are a lot of low-fat or even fat-free franks on the market. You can also opt for a turkey or chicken hot dog. Just make sure you look at the nutrition label. People often think that turkey and chicken are automatically the most calorie-friendly choice. Sometimes they can be just as calorie filled as the original.</p>
<p>You can always skip the beef and go with other lean meats like chicken breast, white fish, shrimp, or even salmon.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>HEALTHY BBQ TIP #3: DITCH THE BUN &amp; CHOOSE CONDIMENTS WISELY</strong></p>
<p><img class="size-large wp-image-7330" src="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_266973608.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_266973608.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_266973608.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_266973608.jpeg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_266973608.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i1.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_266973608.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">What&#8217;s a burger or hot dog without a bun? Actually .. they can be just as delicious without all those extra carbs. A bun usually contains about 200 calories.</p>
<p>Why not save those calories for some delicious sides like potato salad? Or an adult beverage, like a watermelon tonic?</p>
<p>After all, the bun is really just a way for us to eat what’s inside. Your burger will be just as good eaten with a fork!</p>
<p>Save yourself some calories, and opt for a lettuce wrap or no bun at all. Or, check out this delicious bun recipe that is EASY to make and will only set you back a few carbs. You won&#8217;t miss the real bread, promise!!</p>
<p>To make your burger more filling, load it up with plenty of vegetables &#8211; like tomatoes, onions, mushrooms, lettuce, jalapenos, etc. But use caution with condiments.</p>
<p>BBQ sauce and mayonnaise can be calorie bombs. A couple tiny spoonfuls could set you back hundreds of calories. Believe it or not, even ketchup is pretty calorie-dense.</p>
<p>Mustard, salsa, horseradish, and hot sauce are great choices. There are some great low-sugar or lower calorie bbq and ketchup alternatives out there. Look for those when you do your 4th of July grocery haul!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>HEALTHY BBQ TIP #4: PORTION CONTROL</strong></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-7331" src="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_90994388.jpeg?resize=1024%2C669&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="669" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_90994388.jpeg?resize=1024%2C669&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_90994388.jpeg?resize=300%2C196&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_90994388.jpeg?resize=768%2C502&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_90994388.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AdobeStock_90994388.jpeg?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>The best way to avoid a bbq binge is to not go to your cookout hungry. Starving yourself all day could backfire .. causing you to overeat on higher calorie foods.</p>
<p>You don’t need to starve yourself all day and stock-pile calories. Especially if you are using any of our healthy recipes below.</p>
<p>You also don’t need to eat everything available. Prioritize lean protein and veggies and then scan the picnic table for what appeals to you <em><strong>the most</strong></em> and only have small portions of each of those things.</p>
<p>Eat plenty of protein leading up to the BBQ and drink lots of water. Protein shakes are a convenient and delicious way to do that .. and for a limited time we are giving you <strong>40% off your <a href="https://sculptnation.com/products" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sculpt Nation</a> order!</strong></p>

<p>You can also avoid overeating by eating slow and socializing! Food may be a big part of 4th of July festivities .. but it’s not the only reason we gather to celebrate.</p>
<p>If you find yourself still wanting more, step away from the food spread for a little while. Drink some water, or enjoy one of our low-calorie drinks below. Give yourself a little bit of time before you go back for seconds.</p>
<p>Another way you can keep your cravings in check and make sure your body is in a better fat burning mode (instead of fat storing mode) .. is to take a fat-burning thermogenic support supplement like <a href="https://sculptnation.com/products/burn" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>Sculpt Nation BURN.</strong></em></a></p>
<p>This product has a ton of science-backed ingredients that can help naturally suppress your appetite!</p>
<p>It is different from a lot of other fat burners on the market. It doesn’t only help you feel more satiated, it has ingredients that attack your body fat from three essential pathways..</p>
<p>It helps support and raise your metabolic rate, which helps boost your body’s ability to burn fat for fuel!</p>
<p>Grab some <a href="https://sculptnation.com/products/burn" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>BURN</strong></a> today for 40% off! With code <strong>JULY40</strong> at checkout.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>HEALTHY BBQ TIP #5: PUMP UP YOUR PATRIOTISM</strong></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-7322" src="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_8006.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_8006.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_8006.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_8006.jpeg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/vshred.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_8006.jpeg?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>Make sure you put the extra calories to good use and get in a solid workout either after your bbq .. or leading up to the food festivities.</p>
<p>We have a short HIIT workout that we put together for you that would be perfect for the 4th! It is only 12 minutes, so it won’t take up a lot of your day! It also doesn’t require a gym or any equipment .. so you can do it in your backyard or living room! <strong>You can check it out here!</strong></p>
<p>It’s probably safer to exercise pre-bbq..so you are less likely to make excuses later. Especially if your plans involve mixing up any type of adult beverages..</p>
<p>In addition to getting in your patriotic pump workout, look for other ways to add physical activity to your cookout. Go on walks and set up some fun outdoor games!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The summer season is sure to bring all sorts of food temptation..Keep these tips in mind and use them for any cookout or picnic you have planned!</p>
