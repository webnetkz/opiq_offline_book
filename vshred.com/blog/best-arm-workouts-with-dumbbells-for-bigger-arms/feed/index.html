					<description><![CDATA[I have been looking where I could possibly post my comment.. I am going to do it here...Generally people are very sceptical of anything they have to pay for especially if they feel they can have it free from Playstore. Well your Vshred programs are definitely the exception to the rule.. have been using Vshred fat Loss program for 12month and I am very happy with it all.. A structured program is the most important part of any workout.. It keeps you interested.. I have lost 16kg in these twelve month and during that Time I have recommended the program to few other friends. The support is also great as my questions were answered within reasonable time all the time.. Well done Vshred and I am now looking to join the Vshred University program.. However that will have to wait until my sprained shoulder is Ok again.. ( my own fault for totally overdoing it)]]></description>
