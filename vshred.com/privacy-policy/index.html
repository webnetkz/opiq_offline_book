<h5>Right to Know about Personal Information We Collect, Disclose, or Sell</h5>
<p>California consumers have the right to request any of the following information regarding personal information collected by V Shred about the consumer or the consumer’s household during the last twelve (12) months (“Right to Know”):</p>
<ol class="internal-list">
<li>The categories of personal information we collected.</li>
<li>The categories of sources from which the personal information is collected.</li>
<li>The business or commercial purpose for collecting or selling personal information.</li>
<li>For personal information sold or exchanged for value with a third party: categories of personal information and categories of third parties.</li>
<li>For personal information disclosed to a third party for a business purpose: categories of personal information; and categories (of) third parties.</li>
<li>The specific pieces of personal information collected about you (except for very sensitive personally identifiable information, which we will describe, but not transmit).</li>
</ol>
<p>The process by which we verify and respond to your requests is explained below under, “How to Make a Verifiable California Consumer Request” and “How We Will Respond to a California Consumer Request.” You may submit a Right to Know request at Privacy@vshred.com</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Right to Deletion of Personal Information</h5>
<p>California consumers have the right to request that a business delete any personal information about the consumer, which a business has collected from the consumer, subject to a range of exclusions permitted by law (“Right to Delete”). For example, a business is not required to delete personal information if it is necessary to complete a transaction, is reasonably used for an ongoing business relationship, or is used internally in a lawful manner that is compatible with the context in which the consumer provided the information.</p>
<p>Once we receive and verify your request, we will separately confirm your request and follow appropriate procedures to verify the identity and authority of the person submitting the request. If the Right to Delete request is confirmed and verified, we will delete (and direct our service providers to delete) the requested personal information from our records, unless an exclusion applies. If we are unable to fulfill all or part of your request, we will let you know why (for example, if we have a permitted reason to retain certain information if the identity of the requesting person cannot be verified).</p>
<p>The process by which we verify and respond to your requests is explained below under “How to Make a Verifiable California Consumer Request” and “How We Will Respond to a California Consumer Request.” You may submit a Right to Delete request <a href="https://life-fitness.results.highbond.com/survey_responses/ARmsysrrEs1e7dxtPVzs/edit" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>No Sales of Personal Information</h5>
<p>California consumers have the right to direct a business not to sell their personal information to others. In the preceding twelve months, V Shred has not made sales of personal information for monetary or other consideration and has no present plans to do so. We share personal information with third parties for the purposes described in the section of this Privacy Policy titled, "PERSONAL INFORMATION WE SHARE."</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Designating an Authorized Agent</h5>
<p>California consumers may designate an authorized agent to act on their behalf to submit a Right to Know or Right to Delete request, or (if applicable) a request to opt-out from the sale of their Personal Information. An authorized agent may be a natural person, or a business entity registered with the Secretary of State. An authorized agent must also submit to V Shred written proof of their authorization to act on the consumer’s behalf.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>How to Make a Verifiable California Consumer Request</h5>
<p>California consumers may submit a request to exercise any of their rights described above, as noted under the section titled: “How to Contact Us.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>How We Will Respond to a California Consumer Request</h5>
<p>We will confirm receipt of your Right to Know or Right to Delete request within ten (10) days and may request additional information necessary to verify that you are permitted to make the request. We will respond to any verifiable consumer request within forty-five (45) days of receiving it, subject to delays and exclusions permitted by law. If we require more time to respond, we will let you know the reason why and the extension period in writing. If you have a password-protected online account with us, we will respond via that account. If you do not have an online account, we will use the email address or U.S. Postal address you provided to us when making the request.</p>
<p>For a Right to Know request, our response will cover the twelve (12) month period preceding our receipt of the request. If we cannot comply with all or part of your request, we will explain the reasons why. For data portability requests, we will select a format to provide your personal information that is readily useable and should allow you to transmit the information readily from one entity to another entity.</p>
<p>We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable consumer request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded. If we determine that the request warrants a fee, we will tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Protection from Discrimination for Exercising California Consumer Rights</h5>
<p>California consumers have a right not to receive discriminatory treatment by the business for exercising the privacy rights conferred by the California Consumer Privacy Act. As such, we will not discriminate against a California consumer for exercising any of the rights described in this section. This means that except as legally permitted we will not:</p>
<ul class="internal-list">
<li>Deny you goods or services.</li>
<li>Charge you different prices or rates for goods or services, including through granting discounts or other benefits, or imposing penalties.</li>
<li>Provide you a different level or quality of goods or services.</li>
<li>Suggest that you may receive a different price or rate for goods or services or a different level or quality of goods or services.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Financial Incentive Programs</h5>
<p>We are permitted to offer certain financial or service incentives to encourage consumers to provide certain financial information. If we offer a financial or service benefit program to you, we will provide a written description of the material terms of the program to you in a written Notice of Financial Incentive, and you will only be enrolled as a participant if you affirmatively opt-in to the program. You may revoke your opt-in consent at any time. The Notice of Financial Incentive will explain the process for opting-in to participate and withdrawing from the program (opting-out) in.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>California “Shine the Light” Law</h5>
<p>If you are a California resident, California Civil Code Section 1798.83 permits you to request information regarding the disclosure of your personal information by us to third parties for the third-parties’ direct marketing purposes within the immediately preceding calendar year. We will provide you with a list of the categories of personal information disclosed and a list of the names and addresses of the third parties. To make such a request, please send an email including evidence of residency in California to Privacy@vshred.com</p>
