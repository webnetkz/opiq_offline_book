<p>If you’ve struggled to lose weight, damn-near starving yourself just to drop a few pounds of water weight that you regained immediately the second you went back to “normal eating,” you’re not alone. </p>
<p><u>See, there are tens of thousands of women just like you who are being lied to by the fitness industry.</u> </p>
<p>You’ve probably read a mountain of diet books, poured over “fitness” websites, and tried just about every diet that hits the cover of Cosmo, HER, Oxygen, and every other women’s magazine. </p>
 <p>They promised you fast fat loss <i>(sometimes 30-lbs in just a few weeks, right?)</i>.</p>
<p>They tell you there’s a secret food you MUST eat to lose belly fat…</p>

<p>My mom and sisters just about went crazy on Yo-Yo diets. </p>
<p>They worked their butts off only to see their weight fluctuate constantly. They would stumble through their day hungry and exhausted just to drop 3-lbs on the scale - and then lose their spirits as that <b>3lb loss was replaced with a 5lb gain after they stopped starving themselves.</b> </p>
<p>Being a Fitness Model and Certified Trainer, I’d worked mostly with men.</p>
<div class="boxed red-box">
<p>However, seeing the women who mean the most to me in the world suffer, I knew I had to do something.</p>

<p><span class="marker">80% of your results are directly tied to your diet.</span></p>
<p>For most women, this is horrible news.</p>
<h4 class='red'>Why?</h4>
 <p>Because roughly 99% of the diets aimed at women are little more than Starvation Diets repackaged with a fancy name.</p>
<p><span class="marker">If you are following the best workouts in the world, but your diet is ultra low in calories and nutrients, you will not lose fat</span></p>
<p>Sure, the scale might inch down… however, <u>you’re actually losing your lean muscle tissue</u></p>
<img src="/salespages/toned-in-90-days/v1/img/girl-apple1.jpg" alt="" class="single-img hide-desktop" align="right">
<p>Simply put: when you deprive your body of the calories, carbs, fats, proteins, vitamins and minerals it needs, it will find protein and calories wherever it can. </p>
<p>It’s first choice? <b>Your own muscle.</b></p>
<p>Sounds like a horror movie, right? Like some kind of super advanced bio-terroristic plague unleashed on the world. </p>
<p>Nope. It’s your body being forced into survival mode. </p>
<br>
<div class="boxed bg-box">
<h4 class="light pink">When you follow <u>starvation diets</u> you are putting your body <u>in danger for some serious health problems:</u></h4>
<ul class="styled-list">
<li>Slowed metabolic rate <i>(you’ll literally burn less calories for months, even YEARS, after ending a starvation diet)</i></li>
<li>Increased risk of heart attacks</li>
<li>Loss of bone density</li>
<li>Thinning hair</li>
<li>Greater risk of seizures</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="boxed bg-box">
<h3 class="pink text-center">But, how can I <u>lose weight</u> if I don’t significantly lower my calories?</h3>
<p>If you take nothing else away from <u>this page today</u>, please know that the old “calories in vs calories-out” model of weight loss is outdated, flawed, and dangerous.</p>
<p>Yes, you need to watch the amount of calories you consume.</p>
<p>However, drastically cutting your calories puts you on the fast-path to disaster.</p>
<p><b>Same for continually cutting calories over a long period of time. Simply doesn’t work. </b></p>
<p><span class="marker">In fact, this method of dieting actually slows your metabolism, and leads you down a path to eating so little that your body falls into starvation mode.</span></p>
<p><u>The truth is, to rapidly lose stubborn body fat, you must avoid the Starvation Response at all costs.</u></p>
</div>
<div class="boxed bg-box">
<h3 class="pink text-center">How do you do this?</h3>
<p>By learning how to fine-tune your diet, customizing it to fit your body and your goals. </p>
<p><u>This allows you to eat a lot of healthy foods that you actually enjoy.</u> </p>
<p>In fact, not only are you encouraged to eat a lot, you must eat enough calories to take advantage of the Starvation Response arch-enemy: the <b>Thermic Effect of Food.</b></p>
<p><span class="marker">I’ll teach you how, when, and how much to eat so that your body burns more calories after each meal.</span></p>
<p>How cool is that? <u>You get to eat a lot of great food, and it forces your body to burn fat damn-near around the clock.</u></p>
</div>
<div class="boxed bg-box">
<h4 class="text-center light pink">As if that wasn’t enough, there’s a second way to avoid the Starvation Response… and it means eating the carbs that you love…</h4>
<p>Your body runs on two primary sources of energy, fats and carbs. </p>
<p><u>When you follow a low carb diet, your body is forced to burn the fat you eat, and your body fat, for fuel.</u> </p>
<p>Awesome, right? Burn all the bread in your home!</p>
<p>Not so fast…</p>
<p>See, when you go without carbs for too long, your body stops producing the ultra-important fat-burning hormone Leptin. </p>
<p>How can you combine the rapid fat loss from low-carb diets with a constantly elevated leptin level?</p>
<p>Glad you asked…</p>
<p>The answer is simple, yet almost always ignored by the fitness industry: <b>Carb Cycling.</b> </p>
</div>
<p>Quite simply, you combine low carb days with high carb days to keep your body constantly oscillating between burning fat, and replenishing your leptin levels. </p>
<p>Sound complicated?</p>
<p>Don’t worry, I’ll give you the <u>exact formula</u> to use to create the perfect carb cycle for your body - and it <u>takes less than 5-minutes to calculate!</u></p>

<p>You know that just about ever “get in shape quick” program aimed at women includes a TON of cardio.</p>

<p><b>If everyone includes cardio, it must work, right?</b></p>
<p><u>Before we debunk that myth, let’s be honest. You hate doing cardio.</u> </p>

<p>You’re busy. You don’t have all day to waste in spin classes or chained to the treadmill. You also hate the way your knees, ankles, hips, and back feel after jogging. </p>

<p><i>How is this even possible?</i></p>
<p>Back in my days playing football, I noticed something fascinating:</p>
<p><u>Most athletes who were shredded - football players, track and field athletes - never jogged.</u> </p>
<p><b>In fact, the women who ran track were lean, cut, and had powerful, sexy bodies… yet they never did long distance running.</b></p>
<p>Suddenly, it dawned on me: the way these athletes train is <u>PERFECT for fast fat loss because their methods sent their metabolism into hyperdrive after every workout. Combine that with a healthy diet and you have the shortcut to a lean, sexy physique.</u></p>
</div>
<p>Now, don’t worry, you don’t have to be an athlete to benefit from these methods.</p>
<p>In fact, I took what those athletes were doing and modified it so that my mother and sisters could perform these workouts easily, even at home with ZERO equipment.</p>
<p>They loved how fast and efficient these mini-workouts were. And their results were jaw-dropping.</p>
<p>I’ll reveal these exact workouts, and how to adapt them to fit your body perfectly in the <b>Toned In 90-Days</b> Program.</p>
<h4 class="light pink">Even if you did nothing more than add these workouts to your fitness plan, you’re guaranteed to:</h4>

<p>Do you know why most exercise books aimed at women include long, complicated workouts?</p>
<p><b>Because those diet and exercise programs are so generic, so cookie-cutter, that they’re literally written for everyone.</b></p>
